	help
	  uClibc has a native shared library loader for some architectures.
	  If you answer Y here, the uClibc native shared library loader will
	  be built for your target architecture.  If this option is available,
	  to you, then you almost certainly want to answer Y.

config FORCE_SHAREABLE_TEXT_SEGMENTS
	bool "Only load shared libraries which can share their text segment"
	depends on BUILD_UCLIBC_LDSO && UCLIBC_COMPLETELY_PIC
	default n
	help
	  If you answer Y here, the uClibc native shared library loader will
	  only load shared libraries, which do not need to modify any non-writable
	  segments. These libraries haven't set the DT_TEXTREL tag in the dynamic
	  section (==> objdump). So all your libraries must be compiled with
	  -fPIC or -fpic, and all assembler function must be written as position
	  independent code (PIC). 
	  Enabling this option will makes uClibc's shared library loader a
	  little bit smaller and guarantee that no memory will be wasted by badly
	  coded shared libraries.

config UCLIBC_PIE_SUPPORT
	bool "Support ET_DYN in shared library loader"

	  It requires binutils-2.14.90.0.6 or later and the usage of the
	  -pie option.
	  More about ET_DYN/PIE binaries on <http://pageexec.virtualave.net/> .
	  WARNING: This option also enables FORCE_SHAREABLE_TEXT_SEGMENTS, so all

	  Enable this to enable all the code needed to support traditional ldd,
	  which executes the shared library loader to resolve all dependencies
	  and then provide a list of shared libraries that are required for an
	  application to function.  Disabling this option will makes uClibc's
	  shared library loader a little bit smaller.  Most people will answer Y.

config UCLIBC_CTOR_DTOR
	bool "Support global constructors and destructors"
	default y
	help
	  If you wish to build uClibc with support for global constructor
	  (ctor) and global destructor (dtor) support, then answer Y here.
	  When ctor/dtor support is enabled, binaries linked with uClibc must
	  also be linked with crtbegin.o and crtend.o which are provided by gcc
	  (the "*startfile:" and "*endfile:" settings in your gcc specs file
	  may need to be adjusted to include these files).  This support will
	  also add a small amount of additional size to each binary compiled vs
	  uClibc.  If you will be using uClibc with C++, or if you need the gcc
	  __attribute__((constructor)) and __attribute__((destructor)) to work,
	  then you definitely want to answer Y here.  If you don't need ctors
	  or dtors and want your binaries to be as small as possible, then
	  answer N.
	  
config UCLIBC_PROPOLICE
	bool "Support for propolice stack protection"
	default n
	help
	  Propolice stack protection.
	  More about it on <http://www.research.ibm.com/trl/projects/security/ssp> .
	  To be able to use it, you'll also need a propolice patched gcc,
	  supporting the -fstack-protector[-all] options. It is a specially patched
	  gcc version, were __guard and __stack_smash_handler are removed from libgcc.
	  Most people will answer N.

config UCLIBC_PROFILING
	bool "Support gprof profiling"
	default y
	help
	  If you wish to build uClibc with support for application profiling
	  using the gprof tool, then you should enable this feature.  Then in
	  addition to building uClibc with profiling support, you will also
	  need to recompile all your shared libraries with the profiling
	  enabled version of uClibc.  To add profiling support to your
	  applications, you must compile things using the gcc options
	  "-fprofile-arcs  -pg".  Then when you run your applications, a
	  gmon.out file will be generated which can then be analyzed by
	  'gprof'.  

	  These exist a number of less invasive alternatives that do not
	  require your to specially instrument your application, and recompile
	  and relink everything.  
	  
	  Many people have had good results using the combination of Valgrind 
	  to generate profiling information and KCachegrind for analysis:
		  http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/
		  http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/

	  The OProfile system-wide profiler is another alternative:
		  http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/

	  Prospect is another alternative based on OProfile:
		  http://prospect.sourceforge.net/

	  And the Linux Trace Toolkit (LTT) is also a fine tool:
		http://www.opersys.com/LTT/

	  If none of these tools do what you need, you can of course enable
	  this option, rebuild everything, and use 'gprof'.  There is both a
	  size and performance penalty to profiling your applications this way,
	  so most people should answer N.

config HAS_NO_THREADS

config UCLIBC_HAS_THREADS
	bool "POSIX Threading Support"
	depends on !HAS_NO_THREADS
	default y
	help
	  If you want to compile uClibc with pthread support, then answer Y.  
	  This will increase the size of uClibc by adding a bunch of locking
	  to critical data structures, and adding extra code to ensure that
	  functions are properly reentrant.

	  If your applications require pthreads, answer Y.

config PTHREADS_DEBUG_SUPPORT
	bool "Build pthreads debugging support"
	default n
	depends on UCLIBC_HAS_THREADS
	help
	  Say Y here if you wish to be able to debug applications that use
	  uClibc's pthreads library.  By enabling this option, a library 
	  named libthread_db will be built.  This library will be dlopen()'d
	  by gdb and will allow gdb to debug the threads in your application.

	  IMPORTANT NOTE!  Because gdb must dlopen() the libthread_db library,
	  you must compile gdb with uClibc in order for pthread debugging to
	  work properly.

	  If you are doing development and want to debug applications using
	  uClibc's pthread library, answer Y.  Otherwise, answer N.

config UCLIBC_HAS_LFS
	bool "Large File Support"
	default y
	depends on !CONFIG_CRIS
	help
	  If you wish to build uClibc with support for accessing large files 
	  (i.e. files greater then 2 GiB) then answer Y.  Do not enable this 
	  if you are using an older Linux kernel (2.0.x) that lacks large file 
	  support.  Enabling this option will increase the size of uClibc.

choice
	prompt "Malloc Implementation"
	default MALLOC if ! UCLIBC_HAS_MMU
	default MALLOC_STANDARD if UCLIBC_HAS_MMU
	help
	  "malloc" use mmap for all allocations and so works very well on MMU-less
	  systems that do not support the brk() system call.   It is pretty smart
	  about reusing already allocated memory, and minimizing memory wastage.
	  This is the default for uClinux MMU-less systems.

	  "malloc-simple" was written from scratch for uClibc, and is the
	  simplest possible (and therefore smallest) malloc implementation.
	  It is rather dumb, and certainly isn't the fastest.  But it is 100%
	  standards compliant, thread safe, and very small.

	  "malloc-standard" is derived from the public domain dlmalloc
	  implementation by Doug Lea.  It is quite fast, and is pretty smart
	  about reusing already allocated memory, and minimizing memory
	  wastage.  This uses brk() for small allocations, while using mmap()
	  for larger allocations.  This is the default malloc implementation
	  for uClibc.

	  If unsure, answer "malloc-standard".

config MALLOC_GLIBC_COMPAT
	bool "Malloc returns live pointer for malloc(0)"
	default n
	help
	  The behavior of malloc(0) is listed as implementation-defined by
	  SuSv3.  Glibc returns a valid pointer to something, while uClibc
	  normally return a NULL.  I personally feel glibc's behavior is
	  not particularly safe, and allows buggy applications to hide very
	  serious problems.

	  When this option is enabled, uClibc will act just like glibc, and
	  return a live pointer when someone calls malloc(0).  This pointer
	  provides a malloc'ed area with a size of 1 byte.  This feature is
	  mostly useful when dealing with applications using autoconf's broken
	  AC_FUNC_MALLOC macro (which  redefines malloc as rpl_malloc if it
	  does not detect glibc style returning-a-valid-pointer-for-malloc(0)
	  behavior).  Most people can safely answer N.

config UCLIBC_DYNAMIC_ATEXIT
	bool "Dynamic atexit() Support"
	default y
	help
	  When this option is enabled, uClibc will support an infinite number,
	  of atexit() and on_exit() functions, limited only by your available
	  memory.  This can be important when uClibc is used with C++, since
	  global destructors are implemented via atexit(), and it is quite
	  possible to exceed the default number when this option is disabled.
	  Enabling this option adds a few bytes, and more significantly makes
	  atexit and on_exit depend on malloc, which can be bad when compiling 
	  static executables.

	  Unless you use uClibc with C++, you should probably answer N.


config HAS_SHADOW
	bool "Shadow Password Support"
	default y
	help
	  Answer N if you do not need shadow password support.  
	  Most people will answer Y.

config UNIX98PTY_ONLY
	bool "Support only Unix 98 PTYs"
	default y
	help
	  If you want to support only Unix 98 PTYs enable this.  Some older
	  applications may need this disabled.  For most current programs, 
	  you can generally answer Y.

config ASSUME_DEVPTS
	bool "Assume that /dev/pts is a devpts or devfs file system"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this if /dev/pts is on a devpts or devfs filesystem.  Both
	  these filesystems automatically manage permissions on the /dev/pts 
	  devices.  You may need to mount your devpts or devfs filesystem on
	  /dev/pts for this to work.

	  Most people should answer Y.

config UCLIBC_HAS_TM_EXTENSIONS
	bool "Support 'struct tm' timezone extension fields"
	default y
	help
	  Enabling this option adds fields to 'struct tm' in time.h for
	  tracking the number of seconds east of UTC, and an abbreviation for
	  the current timezone.  These fields are not specified by the SuSv3
	  standard, but they are commonly used in both GNU and BSD application
	  code.

	  To strictly follow the SuSv3 standard, leave this disabled.
	  Most people will probably want to answer Y.

config UCLIBC_HAS_TZ_CACHING
	bool "Enable caching of the last valid timezone 'TZ' string"
	default y
	help
	  Answer Y to enable caching of the last valid 'TZ' string describing
	  the timezone setting.  This allows a quick string compare to avoid
	  repeated parsing of unchanged 'TZ' strings when tzset() is called.

	  Most people will answer Y.

config UCLIBC_HAS_TZ_FILE
	bool "Enable '/etc/TZ' file support to set a default timezone (uClibc-specific)"
	default y
	help
	  Answer Y to enable the setting of a default timezone for uClibc.

	  Ordinarily, uClibc gets the timezone information exclusively from the
	  'TZ' environment variable.  In particular, there is no support for
	  the zoneinfo directory tree or the /etc/timezone file used by glibc.

	  With this option enabled, uClibc will use the value stored in the
	  file '/etc/TZ' (default path) to obtain timezone information if the
	  'TZ' environment variable is missing or has an invalid value.  The
	  file consists of a single line (newline required) of text describing
	  the timezone in the format specified for the TZ environment variable.

	  Simply doing 'echo CST6CDT > /etc/TZ' is enough to create a valid file.
	  See
	  http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/basedefs/xbd_chap08.html
	  for details on valid settings of 'TZ'.

	  Most people will answer Y.

config UCLIBC_HAS_TZ_FILE_READ_MANY
	bool "Repeatedly read the '/etc/TZ' file"
	depends on UCLIBC_HAS_TZ_FILE
	default y
	help
	  Answer Y to enable repeated reading of the '/etc/TZ' file even after
	  a valid value has been read.  This incurs the overhead of an open/read/close
	  for each tzset() call (explicit or implied).  However, setting this
	  will allows applications to update their timezone information if the contents
	  of the file change.

	  Most people will answer Y.

config UCLIBC_TZ_FILE_PATH
	string "Path to the 'TZ' file for setting the global timezone"
	depends on UCLIBC_HAS_TZ_FILE
	default "/etc/TZ"
	help
	  This is the path to the 'TZ' file.

	  When a file is opened with update mode ('+' as the second or third character
	  in the list of mode argument values), both input and output may be performed
	  on the associated stream. However, output shall not be directly followed by
	  input without an intervening call to the fflush function or to a file

config DODEBUG
	bool "Build uClibc with debugging symbols"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you wish to compile uClibc with debugging symbols.
	  This will allow you to use a debugger to examine uClibc internals
	  while applications are running.  This increases the size of the
	  library considerably and should only be used when doing development.
	  If you are doing development and want to debug uClibc, answer Y.

	  Otherwise, answer N.

config DOASSERTS
	bool "Build uClibc with run-time assertion testing"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to include runtime assertion tests.
	  This enables runtime assertion testing in some code, which can
	  increase the size of the library and incur runtime overhead.
	  If you say N, then this testing will be disabled.

config SUPPORT_LD_DEBUG
	bool "Build the shared library loader with debugging support"
	depends on BUILD_UCLIBC_LDSO
	default n
	help
	  Answer Y here to enable all the extra code needed to debug the uClibc
	  native shared library loader.  The level of debugging noise that is
	  generated depends on the LD_DEBUG environment variable...  Just set
	  LD_DEBUG to something like: 'LD_DEBUG=token1,token2,..  prog' to
	  debug your application.  Diagnostic messages will then be printed to
	  the stderr.

	  For now these debugging tokens are available:
	    detail        provide more information for some options
	    move          display copy processing
	    symbols       display symbol table processing
	    reloc         display relocation processing; detail shows the relocation patch
	    nofixups      never fixes up jump relocations
	    bindings      displays the resolve processing (function calls); detail shows the relocation patch
	    all           Enable everything!

	  The additional environment variable:
	    LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT=file
	  redirects the diagnostics to an output file created using
	  the specified name and the process id as a suffix.

	  An excellent start is simply:
	    $ LD_DEBUG=binding,move,symbols,reloc,detail ./appname
	  or to log everything to a file named 'logfile', try this
	    $ LD_DEBUG=all LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT=logfile ./appname

	  If you are doing development and want to debug uClibc's shared library
	  loader, answer Y.  Mere mortals answer N.

config SUPPORT_LD_DEBUG_EARLY
	bool "Build the shared library loader with early debugging support"
	depends on BUILD_UCLIBC_LDSO
	default n
	help
	  Answer Y here to if you find the uClibc shared library loader is
	  crashing or otherwise not working very early on.  This is typical
	  only when starting a new port when you haven't figured out how to
	  properly get the values for argc, argv, environ, etc.  This method
	  allows a degree of visibility into the very early shared library
	  loader initialization process.  If you are doing development and want
	  to debug the uClibc shared library loader early initialization,
	  answer Y.  Mere mortals answer N.

config UCLIBC_MALLOC_DEBUGGING
	bool "Build malloc with debugging support"
	depends MALLOC
	default n
	help
	  Answer Y here to compile extra debugging support code into malloc.
	  Malloc debugging output may then be enabled at runtime using the
	  MALLOC_DEBUG environment variable.

	  The value of MALLOC_DEBUG should be an integer, which is interpreted as
	  a bitmask with the following bits:
		  1   -  do extra consistency checking
		  2   -  output messages for malloc/free calls and OS allocation calls
		  4   -  output messages for the `MMB' layer
		  8   -  output messages for internal malloc heap manipulation calls
	  
	  Because this increases the size of malloc appreciably (due to strings
	  etc), you should say N unless you need to debug a malloc problem.

config UCLIBC_MJN3_ONLY
