2004-06-23  John Dallaway  <jld@ecoscentric.com>

	* interp.cxx (locate_subdirs): Avoid use of a trailing period in
	the file path. This causes problems for Cygwin 1.5.10.
	[ Bugzilla 1000095 ]

2003-08-19  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* config.cxx (savefile_package_command):
	If no version is specified, silently default to the most recent.
	That can avoid problems with templates specifying particular versions
	and then providing an update epk.

2003-05-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* doc/package.sgml: Use PNGs instead of GIFs.
	* doc/jadetex.cfg: Add this to configure PDF output nicely with index
	and coloured links.

2003-03-26  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl.hxx, config.cxx.cxx, package.cxx:
	Update derived classes now that the repository is per-loadable
	rather than per-toplevel. Also turn ECOS_REPOSITORY into a
	path rather than a single directory, updating all affected
	database and config code.

	* base.cxx, build.cxx, cdlcore.hxx: make the repository a
	characteristic of each loadable rather than of the toplevel

2003-02-12  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* Makefile.in, configure, testsuite/Makefile.in:
	Regenerate after acinclude.m4 update

2003-02-11  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* build.cxx (compare_and_copy):
	Work around problem with cygwin tclsh84 - "file rename" may
	spuriously report failure.

2003-02-03  John Dallaway  <jld@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl.dsp: Call tclsh rather than cygtclsh80 in custom build rule.

2002-12-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* doc/.cvsignore: Added this file to ignore generated HTML files.

2002-09-21  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdlcore.hxx, cdl.hxx, build.cxx, component.cxx, config.cxx,
	  database.cxx, dialog.cxx, interface.cxx, interp.cxx,
	  option.cxx, package.cxx, parse.cxx, property.cxx,
	  value.cxx, wizards.cxx
	Avoid const compatibility problems with Tcl 8.4

2002-08-03  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* acinclude.m4, configure.in, Makefile.am, testsuite/Makefile.am,
	testsuite/config/default.exp:
	Rework host-side autoconf support
	
2002-03-04  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* build.cxx (update_header_file_info): 
	Suppress include files which and in "~" - these are backup
	files and are transient.  Keeping them can break a build
	tree if the backup files are removed.

2002-02-18  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* transact.cxx (user_confirmation_required):
	Making a valuable with a user_value inactive requires
	user confirmation, it should not be done automatically
	by the inference engine.

2001-12-07  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* doc/language.sgml, doc/*.html:
	Add a footnote clarifying a particular Tcl expression
	(bug 57097). Regenerate html.

	* doc/fixhtml.tcl
	Removed, the master copy now lives in pkgconf

2001-12-06  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* cdlcore.hxx, build.cxx, interp.cxx:
	Move #include of <cctype> to common header rather than to
	individual source files, avoiding build problems with
	newer compilers. Reported by Jeff Law.

	* infer.cxx (inner_resolve):
	CdlTransaction::is_preferable_to() is not symmetric. Rearrange
	some expressions so that disabling options or making them
	inactive is subtly discouraged rather than encouraged.

2001-07-20  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* value.cxx (save):
	Complicated "requires" expressions spread over multiple lines
	were not being turned into multiline comments, leading to
	illegal savefiles.

2001-07-11  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* transact.cxx (is_preferable_to):
	Consider active changes as well as value changes.

	Fine-tune the determination of which of two transactions has less
	impact on the system.
	
	* infer.cxx (infer_handle_interface_value):
	Add inference engine support for constraints of the form
	(xxx == 0) and (xxx = 1), where xxx is an interface.
	
2001-07-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* interp.cxx: include <cctype> as isspace() is used.

2001-06-21  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	<merge of development work>
	* base.cxx, cdlcore.hxx, property.cxx, parse.cxx, value.cxx, refer.cxx:

	* doc/language.sgml, doc/reference.sgml:
	Document the above changes

	* doc/*.html:
	Regenerate following above changes, and using newer stylesheets
	etc. 

2001-06-20  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* database.cxx, cdl.hxx:
	
	Add a verbosity flag to control whether or not certain warnings
	are issued. The main warnings of interest are inconsistencies
	between the database and the repository, e.g. packages listed
	but not actually installed, as can happen in anoncvs checkouts.

2001-05-16  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* Makefile.am: use new compiler flag support

	* configure, Makefile.in, testsuite/Makefile.in: regenerate
	
2001-05-14  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	Added documentation on functions

	* func.cxx, Makefile.am, Makefile.in:
	New module for function support inside expressions

	* expr.cxx
	Add support for functions and the string concatenation operator. 

	* infer.cxx

	functionalitity generally.

2001-04-19  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* doc/*.sgml, *.html:
	Update as per current corporate doc conventions.

2001-02-27  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* interp.cxx (locate_subdirs): Accept "cvs" as a synonym for "CVS"
	* database.cxx (new_package): Ditto.

2000-08-18  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* configure.in:
	Allow cross-compilation.

	* configure, Makefile.in, testsuite/Makefile.in:
	Regenerate.

	* base.cxx, build.cxx, cdl.hxx, cdlcore.hxx, component.cxx,
	config.cxx, database.cxx, dialog.cxx, expr.cxx, interface.cxx,
	interp.cxx, option.cxx, package.cxx, parse.cxx, value.cxx,
	wizard.cxx
	Remove C++ exception specifications, because they cause problems
	with some versions of the tools.

2000-07-06  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* conflict.cxx (get_explanation):
	Put quotes around "requires" in the conflict explanation.
	Requested by the eCos team.

2000-07-04  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* value.cxx (save):
	The comment "# This value cannot be modified here." was being
	added even for modifiable options, courtesy of some earlier
	code rearrangement.

	* config.cxx (change_package_version):
	Prevent assertion failure/crash when changing the version of a
	package that has not been loaded (not uncommon when using
	ecosconfig and confusing the order of the version and the
	package(s)).

2000-06-28  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* transact.cxx, cdlcore.hxx:
	Add details of the current transaction to the transaction callback
	class. Previously there was no way of getting hold of the current
	transaction and hence the toplevel from inside the callback
	without using statics.

	* value.cxx (set_flavor):
	Temporarily undo some of the previous value clean-ups, they were
	causing problems at the application level. The API needs to be
	changed to eliminate confusion between value and the data part
	of a bool/value pair.

2000-06-22  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* value.cxx, interface.cxx:
	Allow the flavor property to be used on interfaces. booldata
	interfaces allow the use of #ifdef to determine whether or not
	a feature is available. Clean up some of the value stuff to match,
	especially when it comes to savefiles.

	* build.cxx, cdlmisc.cxx, cdlcore.hxx:
	Add version #define support.

2000-06-15  John Dallaway  <jld@redhat.com>

	* cdl.dsp:
	Build libCDL to v:\cdl rather than v:\ide. Build debug versions
	against tcl82d.lib rather than tcl82.lib.

2000-06-02  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* config.cxx (load_package):
	Diagnostic function pointers were not being installed at the
	package level, so error messages due to invalid CDL were
	disappearing.

2000-05-11  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* value.cxx (implements_update_handler):
	Cope gracefully with implements properties where the destination
	is not an interface.

	* transact.cxx (clear_structural_conflicts):
	Prevent a structural conflict from being destroyed twice (only
	likely to happen during a major delete operation).

2000-04-14  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* infer.cxx (infer_set_valuable_value):
	Extend the == operator inference support to cope with bool and
	booldata options.

2000-04-11  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* infer.cxx (infer_make_active):
	Fix infinite recursion. Naughty inference engine.

	* interp.cxx (eval):
	Diagnostics enhancement tweak.

	* build.cxx (generate_config_header):
	Add a context when generating header files.

	* base.cxx (CdlLoadableBody):
	Add a context to the CdlInterpreter on creation, for better
	diagnostics.
	Do not raise errors in the internal Tcl scripts, since those
	may now get reported.

	* database.cxx (new_package):
	A single spurious subdirectory in a package should not invalidate
	the entire package.

2000-04-10  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* base.cxx, build.cxx, cdl.hxx, cdlcore.hxx, cdlmisc.cxx,
	component.cxx, config.cxx, database.cxx, dialog.cxx, expr.cxx,
	interface.cxx, interp.cxx, option.cxx, package.cxx, parse.cxx,
	property.cxx, value.cxx, wizard.cxx
	Improved diagnostics support.

	* build.cxx, property.cxx, parse.cxx:
	Allow for string vector properties with no elements. Use this
	for the include_files property.

2000-03-13  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl.dsp:
	Modify libCDL custom build step to calculate the short form
	of the host tools root directory to allow rebuilding using an
	eCos installation in its default location (containing spaces).

	Use the presence of the last file generated by the
	configure phase (the ecosconfig makefile) to determine whether
	to invoke configure. This provides some	further robustness
	against failed or interrupted builds.

2000-03-08  Simon FitzMaurice <sdf@cygnus.co.uk>
        * cdl.dsp : Modify libCDL custom build step to add --enable-maintainer-mode

2000-03-08  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl.dsp:
	Modify libCDL custom build step to configure in the host tools
	directory rather than the root of the eCos repository.

2000-03-08  Simon FitzMaurice <sdf@cygnus.co.uk>
        * cdl.dsp : Modify libCDL custom build step to avoid running configure every time.

2000-03-07  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

 	* cdl.dsp:
	Modify libCDL custom build step to accommodate the migration
	if libCDL sources.

2000-03-01  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* expr.cxx (eval_internal):
	If there is an eval exception, only manipulate conflicts if we are
	in a transaction.

	* value.cxx:
	Make the code more robust against eval exceptions

2000-02-15  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* build.cxx (generate_config_header):
	Fix the symbol that gets used for define properties.

	* package.cxx (get_config_header):
	Completely suppress the generation of <pkgconf/hardware.h> until
	further notice. Allow active_if properties in packages.
	Comment a need for default_value properties.
	
2000-02-11  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl.dsp
	Configure and make 'quietly' for release builds to help contain
	the length of the release logs.

	* cdl.mak:
	Remove this obsolete file.

2000-02-10  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* package.cxx (parse_package):
	Allow packages to have active_if properties.
	Add a comment that default_value in a package should be allowed as
	a way of controlling enabled/disabled state.

2000-02-03  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* infer.cxx (infer_handle_reference_bool):
	Earlier fix missed yet more sub-transactions that should have been
	cancelled. 

2000-02-02  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* infer.cxx (infer_make_inactive):
	Earlier fix missed a sub-transaction that should have been
	cancelled.

	* value.cxx (implements_update_handler):
	Also recalculate an interface if the destination is created.
	Otherwise an interface will have the wrong value if it is loaded
	after all its implementors.

	*  infer.cxx, transact.cxx:
	Make sure that sub-transactions are either cancelled or committed
	before they get deleted.

2000-01-26  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* config.cxx (save):
	Always output the description field for a standard savefile.

	* base.cxx (save_conflicts):
	Add missing newline

	* infer.cxx (infer_subexpr_bool):
	Fix the handling of && and ||

	* infer.cxx (infer_handle_reference_value):
	Do not try modifying inactive data items, there is no point
	and it could cause an assertion failure

2000-01-25  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* config.cxx:
	Extend the savefile support to remember which packages
	belong to the hardware and which ones belong to the
	template.

2000-01-24  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* cdlcore.hxx, parse.cxx, wizard.cxx (parse_screen): 
	Change parse_property_options() to parse_options() so that it can
	be used for more than just properties

	* cdlcore.hxx, config.cxx:
	Make sure that a LocalTransaction always gets cancelled if
	things go wrong and an exception is thrown, prior to the
	transaction being deleted.

	* base.cxx, interp.cxx, value.cxx:
	Savefile format tweaks.

2000-01-21  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* base.cxx (add_node_to_toplevel):
	When a loadable was re-added to the toplevel after an unload was
	cancelled, its parent was not set correctly.

	* infer.cxx:
	Add partial support for dependencies of the form X==Y

2000-01-20  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in:
	Fix dependencies for interface.cxx and transact.cxx, these
	were sometimes rebuilt unnecessarily

	* cdlcore.hxx, base.cxx, transact.cxx, config.cxx, package.cxx:
	All file I/O related operations now happen in the context
	of a transaction.

1999-12-17  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl.hxx, config.cxx, database.cxx:
	Add support for set_value commands in ecos.db target entries.

	* database.cxx:
	Remove old support for template definitions in ecos.db

1999-12-16  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* nearly all files:
	Add support for memory leak detection, by maintaining per-class
	object counts via the appropriate constructors and destructors.

	* database.cxx:
	Plug a one-off memory leak.

1999-12-14  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* interp.cxx:
	Modify CdlInterpreterBody::locate_subdirs(),
	CdlInterpreterBody::locate_files(),
	CdlInterpreterBody::is_directory() and
	CdlInterpreterBody::is_file() to accommodate
	spaces in paths.

1999-12-13  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdlcore.hxx, interface.cxx, transact.cxx, value.cxx:
	Calculate values for interfaces.

	* base.cxx, cdl.hxx, cdlcore.hxx, component.cxx, config.cxx,
	  database.cxx, dialog.cxx, interface.cxx, interp.cxx, option.cxx,
	  package.cxx, value.cxx, wizard.cxx:
	Implementation of templates in the form of the partial savefiles.

1999-12-10  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdlcore.hxx:
	Use '#pragma warning()' under VC++ only.

1999-12-09  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdlmisc.cxx (compare_versions):
	V1.3.1 and V1.3B6 were not compared correctly.

1999-12-03  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* build.cxx (update_header_file_info):
	If a package has no include subdirectory and no include_files
	property, search the package directory tree for anything
	resembling a header file and install that.

1999-11-30  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* base.cxx:
	Made the multiple conflict solution code more robust when side
	effects occur.

	* transact.cxx:
	When a new conflict is committed and becomes global its solution
	must be cleared, since no attempt is made to preserve the validity
	of global solutions.

	* transact.cxx (resolve):
	Try to make sure that the inference callback gets invoked whenever
	appropriate.

	* base.cxx:
	When resolving multiple global conflicts, fixing the first one may
	have the side effect of fixing subsequent ones as well, resulting
	in an assertion failure because the inference engine reported a
	success with no changes being required. This situation is now
	checked for.

	* parse.cxx (parse_property_options):
	Allow for a NULL options descriptor

1999-11-28  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* transact.cxx:
	Global conflict resolution support
	
	* infer.cxx:
	Clean-up for resolving global conflicts
	Cancel undesirable transactions before they are deleted

	* conflict.cxx: 
	Add support for resolving global conflicts
	Implement get_transaction() member
	
	* cdlcore.hxx:
	Add support for resolving global conflicts
	Tidy up the transaction and transaction callback classes a bit.
	
	* base.cxx:
	Add support for resolving global conflicts

1999-11-26  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* build.cxx:
	Modify CdlToplevelBody::generate_config_headers() and
	compare_and_copy() to accommodate spaces in the path to the
	headers directory.

1999-11-23  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* database.cxx (new_target):
	command_prefix is no longer compulsory for ecos.db target entries,
	since this is now handled in the config data. command_prefix and
	cflags are still allowed in ecos.db for now, but will be removed
	in future.

1999-11-22  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* base.cxx:
	During an unload operation a conflict may be cleared for multiple
	reasons: the requires condition may now be satisfied, e.g
	"requires !xxx" where "xxx" is also being unloaded; and the
	node containing the requires property may be disappearing as well.
	
	* transact.cxx (save_solution):
	If any parts of a solution involve calculated options then there
	is no point in exposing this to the user. The re-calculation will
	happen automatically during the next propagation.

	* base.cxx:
	* config.cxx:
	Stop the inference engine from running when packages are loaded or
	unloaded. The user has no opportunity to cancel or undo the
	operation, and there may be unexpected behaviour because the
	inference engine has no clear view of what the overall
	configuration is going to be.

	* transact.cxx (resolve):
	Resolving one conflict may affect others in the new_conflicts
	list. Using an iterator to examine all conflicts is a bad idea.
	Instead each loop needs to search for a conflict that may
	have a solution.

	* base.cxx:
	* config.cxx:
	* cdlcore.hxx:
	Rearrange how a CdlConfiguration gets destroyed, to allow dynamic
	casts to be used on the toplevel as packages are unloaded.

1999-11-22  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* config.cxx:
	Modify CdlConfigurationBody::load_package() to accommodate
	spaces in the path to the eCos repository.

1999-11-21  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* infer.cxx:
	* transact.cxx:
	* cdlcore.hxx:
	First implementation of inference code

	* conflict.cxx:
	Added missing is_structural() member
	
1999-11-18  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* value.cxx:
	Created a CdlSimpleValue constructor for booleans, to match the
	assignment operator.

	* expr.cxx :
	Modify list expression evaluation code so that any terms which
	evaluate to empty strings are discarded.

1999-11-08  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* database.cxx:
	Switched to ECOS_REPOSITORY environment variable.
	
	* transact.cxx:
	* cdlcore.hxx:
	Separated out normal and structural conflicts in the transaction
	callback class.
	
	* value.cxx:
	* interp.cxx:
	* cdlcore.hxx:
	Added new member CdlInterpreterBody::extend_comment(), for better
	support of multiline comments in savefiles.

1999-11-03  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdlcore.hxx, base.cxx, transact.cxx, value.cxx:
	Newly loaded nodes were starting out as active, and were not being
	turned inactive if the parent was disabled. By default nodes are
	now inactive and there is explicit code in the transaction
	propagate member function to check whether or not each node should
	be active.

	* Most files
	Install the new transaction model

1999-11-03  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* value.cxx:
	Apply patch to correct the omission of a comment char from
	continuation lines of calculated value comments in
	configuration save files.

1999-10-25 Simon FitzMaurice <sdf@cygnus.co.uk>
	* value.cxx:
	Apply fix (supplied by Bart) to correct omission of comment symbol
	from start of second and subsequent lines of split statement.

1999-10-14  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* database.cxx:
	* cdl.hxx:
	Add support for new per-target commands enable and disable,
	which provide limited control over hardware-related configuration
	options.

	* config.cxx (set_hardware):
	Process per-target enable/disable commands from the database

1999-10-12  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* build.cxx (generate_config_headers):

	Workaround problem with assignment of standard channels
	which was causing system.h to not be generated.

1999-10-08  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl.dsp, cdl.mak:

	Link against Tcl 8.2.1.

1999-10-07  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* value.cxx (get_widget_hint):
	For some expressions this was corrupting the expression data,
	because of the use of a reference rather than a pointer.

1999-10-06  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdlcore.hxx, database.cxx, expr.cxx, interface.cxx, value.cxx

	* all files
	First implementation of the savefile support

1999-09-07  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl.dsp, cdl.mak:

	--enable-debuginfo option.

	* libcdl.hxx:
	CdlBaseBody is now an ordinary base class for CdlContainerBody,

	yet.
	The CdlGoalExpressionBody copy constructor is now public, not
	protected, for use by the config tool.

	Do not try to parse options just yet, there is confusion if
	the expression begins with a negative number.

1999-03-08  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* interp.cxx (eval):
	Make sure that C strings passed to the Tcl interpreter
	are properly terminated.

	* configure:
	* stamp-h.in:
	* testsuite/Makefile.in:
	Updated to use autoconf 2.13 and automake 1.4, plus to reflect
	tweaks to toplevel acinclude.m4 and local configure.in
	
	* configure.in:

	(make_safe)    : also, the ability to make an interpreter safe.
	(set_result)   : not to mention, controlling the result field.

	* cdlmisc.cxx (compare_versions):
	Added new function Cdl::compare_versions()
