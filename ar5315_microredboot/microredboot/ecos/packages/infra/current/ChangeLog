2004-07-12  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/diag.cxx (_vprintf): Fix return length for %%

2004-06-30  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/diag.cxx (_vprintf): Returned [length] was wrong for %p

2004-04-16  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests/cxxsupp.cxx: Allow inline function to be correctly inlined.

2004-04-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/cyg_type.h: added CYG_ATTRIB_ALIGN_MAX and
	CYGBLD_ATTRIB_ALIGNOFTYPE. Inspired by Robert Larice.
	
2004-01-08  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	* src/diag.cxx (diag_check_string): Allow '\t' in format strings.
	
2004-01-05  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* tests/fc_test.c: 
	* src/tcdiag.cxx (cyg_assert_msg): 'fconfig' API changed again.

2003-12-21  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* tests/fc_test.c: New test/demonstration of 'fconfig' access.

	* src/tcdiag.cxx (cyg_assert_msg): Interface to 'fconfig' data
	has changed.

2003-10-11  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/tcdiag.cxx (cyg_test_exit): 
	* cdl/infra.cdl: New option CYGSEM_INFRA_RESET_ON_TEST_EXIT which
	[if defined] indicates that "cyg_test_exit()" should reset the 
	platform instead of the default hang.

2003-10-03  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* tests/cxxsupp.cxx: Added ifdef to disable this test on H8/300
	targets. The H8/300 toolchain does not currently have C++ support.

2003-07-01  Michael Checky  <Michael_Checky@ThermoKing.com>

	* src/diag.cxx: Added support for the 'z' qualifier in format strings.

2003-05-05  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* cdl/infra.cdl: Add option to control number of times tests run.

2003-04-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests/cxxsupp.cxx: don't include <pkgconf/kernel.h> as it's not
	needed.
	(cyg_start): CYGINT_ISO_MALLOC needs a #if test.

2003-04-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* tests/cxxsupp.cxx: Added this test program to check that basic
	C++ support is present. It checks that pure virtual functions can
	be defined, that new and delete are present and functional, and
	that calls to as-yet undefined inline functions work. Most of
	these are linker and runtime system issues, so the actual run of
	the program is almost a non-event.

	* cdl/infra.cdl:
	Added CYGFUN_INFRA_DUMMY_ABORT and CYGFUN_INFRA_DUMMY_STRLEN
	options to control inclusion of dummy abort() and strlen()
	functions. These are needed to be present by the compiler's C++
	runtime system, although they should never be called.
	Added CYGPKG_INFRA_TESTS to define test programs.
	Added CYGPKG_INFRA_LDFLAGS_REMOVE and CYGPKG_INFRA_LDFLAGS_ADD to
	modify the linkage options for the infra package
	tests. Specifically they remove the --gc-sections option and make
	all linker warning fatal. This is necessary if cxxsupp.cxx is to
	test what it needs correctly.
	
	* src/abort.cxx: Added this dummy implementation of abort() to
	satisfy references in the C++ runtime system.

	* src/strlen.cxx: Added this dummy implementation of strlen() to
	satisfy references in the C++ runtime system.

2003-03-27  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/pure.cxx, cdl/infra.cdl: new function __cxa_pure_virtual(),
	needed when building with g++ v3.x if the code uses pure
	virtual functions.

2003-01-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/cyg_ass.h (CYG_CHECK_FUNC_PTRC): Define with const pointer
	arguments.
	(CYG_CHECK_DATA_PTRC): Ditto.

	* include/cyg_type.h: Allow HALs to override certain attrib macros.

2002-02-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/diag.cxx (diag_snprintf): 
	* include/diag.h: Change function signature on diag_snprintf()
	to match snprintf() found in stdio.

2002-02-13  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/cyg_trac.h: Make message type of trace functions be
	const char * to help avoid warnings with callers.
	* src/null.cxx: Reflect that in actual functions.
	* src/fancy.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/simple.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/buffer.cxx: Ditto.

2002-01-31  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/tcdiag.cxx (cyg_assert_msg): Enable this function
	universally; given the extra usefulness it now has (see below)
	it's worth always having around by default in asserted builds.
	It can be disabled with CYGDBG_INFRA_DEBUG_ASSERT_MESSAGE = 0.

2002-01-30  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/tcdiag.cxx (cyg_assert_msg): Collect from RedBoot flash
	config, whether or not to dump to a specific console.

	* include/cyg_type.h: Define CYG_INIT_IO_FS used by filesystems
	so that they init *after* the devices they depend on.

2002-01-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/tcdiag.cxx (cyg_test_exit): Work around problem with recent
	SH tools that isn't likely to get fixed soon.

2002-01-17  Jeroen Dobbelaere  <jeroen.dobbelaere@acunia.com>

	* src/diag.cxx (diag_check_string): enlarge valid string length to 2048

2001-12-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/diag.cxx: Added functions to do memory dump in 16 and 32 bit

	which were present in old code.

2001-08-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/diag.cxx: 
	* include/diag.h: 
	* cdl/infra.cdl: Restructuring to support more flexible versions
	of diag_printf() and related functions.  Remove old cruft which
	was workaround for possibly failing compilers [K&R support].
	These versions of printf(), etc, were part of the RedBoot package
	and have been moved here (and renamed) to reduce code duplication.

2001-08-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	the MLQ scheduler and alarm objects.

2000-12-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/clist.hxx: Added this implementation of simple circular
	list classes. This is not immediately useful, except to the
	dynamic loader, but it is intended to simplify the MLQ scheduler
	with these classes eventually.

2000-12-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/cyg_type.h (CYGBLD_ATTRIB_ASM_ALIAS): Mangle assembler
	symbols properly.

	* src/pkgstart.cxx (cyg_package_start): Remove POSIX startup option
	* cdl/startup.cdl: Likewise

2000-07-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/buffer.cxx (increment_buffer_pos): Reset buffer pos *before*
	we try to print the buffer
	Thanks to Chris Morrow (cmorrow at YottaYotta.com ) for spotting
	the problem.

2000-07-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/infra.cdl: Add CYGFUN_INFRA_EMPTY_DELETE_FUNCTIONS option
	to control presence of empty C++ delete functions

	* include/cyg_type.h:
	Added CYGBLD_ATTRIB_SECTION to assign variables to a named

	* cdl/startup.cdl:
	* src/pkgstart.cxx:

	* src/diag.cxx (diag_vprintf): Add support for %llX modifier, which
	allows for printing of (long long) operands.

2000-03-27  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/buffer.cxx: Fix some compiler warnings.

2000-03-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/cyg_type.h (CYGBLD_ATTRIB_WEAK): disarm bomb for !GCC.

	103290
	* include/cyg_ass.h: Make cyg_assert_fail a weak symbol.

2000-02-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

2000-02-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/tcdiag.cxx (cyg_test_is_simulator): set this true if ugly
	new cdl_option CYGHWR_TARGET_SIMULATOR_NO_GDB_WORKING is set.
	This means we cannot diddle the variable using GDB.

2000-02-18  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/tcdiag.cxx (cyg_test_exit): Add the facility for a platform
	HAL to define an action to take at CYG_TEST_EXIT time; this is
	useful for some simulators that are not (yet) Gdb integrated.
	The action is CYGHWR_TEST_PROGRAM_EXIT() if defined.

	* src/simple.cxx (cyg_assert_fail): Add the facility for a
	platform HAL to define an action to take when an assertion failure
	occurs.  Ditto.

	* src/fancy.cxx (cyg_assert_fail): Ditto.

	* src/buffer.cxx (cyg_assert_fail): Ditto.

	[no change to null.cxx because, well, it's null isn't it]

2000-02-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/cyg_trac.h: Define and document CYG_TRACE_PRINT() and
	CYG_TRACE_DUMP() macros for outputting buffered trace output, and
	kernel state dump respectively

	* cdl/debug.cdl (CYGDBG_INFRA_DEBUG_TRACE_ASSERT_BUFFER): 
	replace (incorrect) mention of cyg_trace_output() with CYG_TRACE_PRINT()
	macro.

	* src/fancy.cxx (cyg_trace_dump): Add (from buffer.cxx)

2000-01-28 Simon FitzMaurice  <sdf@cygnus.co.uk>
  * cdl\infra.cdl:

  Adjust help URLs in line with new doc layout.

	* include/cyg_type.h: Add MLT symbols CYGMEM_REGION_ATTR_R/W.

1999-11-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/debug.cdl: Add "active_if CYGDBG_USE_TRACING" to all tracing
	only options in the buffered flavour of assert'n'trace.  Otherwise
	enabling asserts but no tracing does not build; oldCDL dealt with
	this by a string of ifdefs in the header.  Active_if is my friend.
	This also prevents the confusion of having active options that
	have no effect whatsoever.
	Aside: the default is buffered assert'n'trace so that the test
	farm can enable tracing and not get swamped by output.

1999-05-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/cyg_type.h (CYG_INIT_COMPAT): add a new init priority
	level for compatibility layers (for uITRON that is, but

	* include/diag.h: 
	* src/diag.cxx: 
	Use device for diag if configured so.

1999-03-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/diag.cxx (diag_vprintf): Support '%%' printf modifier.

1999-03-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	Remove CYG_INIT_BEFORE/AFTER as they were unusable

	* include/testcase.h:
	* src/tcdiag.cxx:
	Add CYGNUM_TEST_NA() macro for not applicable state
	Don't need to call diag_init() any more from cyg_test_init()

	* src/diag.c:
	* src/diag.cxx: 
	Rename diag.c to diag.cxx
	Add dummy constructor object to do initialization right after the
	HAL has started. Needed to get asserts working correctly at
	constructor time, and for CYGNUM_TEST_GDBCMD to work as intended
	(i.e. before calling CYG_TEST_INIT())

1999-02-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/tcdiag.cxx (cyg_test_output): Remove angle brackets round
	GDBCMD output

	New macro, used to define a 'C' routine to be run with 'C++'
	constructors.

1999-01-26  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/cyg_type.h (CYGBLD_ATTRIB_NORET):
	Updated the non-GNUC version of the macro

1999-01-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/cyg_type.h:
	Remove all traces of CYG_KERNEL_USE_INIT_PRIORITY option - now
	compulsory. Consequently can remove include of pkgconf/infra.h.
	Add CYG_INIT_PREDEFAULT priority for
	CYGSEM_HAL_STOP_CONSTRUCTORS_ON_FLAG implementation.
	Change CYGBLD_NORET to CYGBLD_ATTRIB_NORET

	Make this work with no overhead, although it doesn't work with
	anything other than objects with constructors. I _believe_ this
	is the only relevant situation though. Bite me.
	Fix for PR 18782

1999-01-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/cyg_type.h (CYG_REFERENCE_SYMBOL): Added.

1999-01-13  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/cyg_type.h: Default handling of 'CYG_DOUBLE_BYTEORDER'

1999-01-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/cyg_type.h (CYG_UNUSED_PARAM): Don't assign to the
	unused parameter; it might be a macro constant.

1999-01-11  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/tcdiag.cxx (cyg_test_output): 
	* include/testcase.h:
	Use const where appropriate in cyg_test_output()

1999-01-06  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/cyg_trac.h (CYG_REPORT_FUNCARG8):
	Removed spurious comma so that the macro actually compiles.

1998-12-24  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/simple.cxx: 
	* src/null.cxx: 
	* src/fancy.cxx: 
	* src/diag.c: 
	* src/buffer.cxx: 
	* include/diag.h:
	In the assertion support, use const where appropriate.
	
1998-12-24  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/cyg_ass.h:
	The prototype for cyg_assert_fail() is now always present.
	const is used wherever appropriate.
	A number of additional assertion macros are now defined.
	Host-specific assertion support has been added.
	Some minor tweaks for greater consistency in macro usage.

1998-12-21  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/cyg_type.h:
	Allow for platforms where pointers are not 32 bits wide.
	
1998-12-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/testcase.h (cyg_test_is_simulator): 
	* src/tcdiag.cxx (cyg_test_is_simulator): 
	Change the type to int so that all gdb's understand it.
	(it was impossible to assign to from the prompt as a bool)

1998-12-09  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/testcase.h:
	Hide a __noreturn__ attribute inside a macro so that the
	header file can be used for host-side code.

1998-11-02  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/memset.c (_memset): Use type casted pointer to avoid
	compiler warning.

Mon Oct 26 21:20:13 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/buffer.cxx: 
	Make write_thread_id() conditional on CYGDBG_USE_ASSERTS as that's
	the only time it is used. This silences a compiler warning

Mon Oct 26 19:40:48 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/memset.c, src/memcpy.c:
	Conditionalise out all tracing for now
	Fix for PR 17996

Fri Oct 23 05:42:36 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/cyg_ass.h (CYGASSERT_docall): 
	Make a dummy reference to _msg_ argument when
	CYGDBG_INFRA_DEBUG_ASSERT_MESSAGE is disabled, otherwise we may get
	"unused variable" warnings
	Fix for PR 17889

1998-10-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/buffer.cxx (increment_buffer_pos): 
	Use the correctly named print_trace_buffer() rather than some
	typo/globaleditto.
	(cyg_trace_dump): only refer to thread->get_saved_context() if
	CYGDBG_KERNEL_DEBUG_GDB_THREAD_SUPPORT is defined.

1998-10-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/buffer.cxx (write_thread_id): 
	Make get_tid() be there when used.

	* include/pkgconf/infra.h: 
	Only enable all the buffered tracing stuff if USE_TRACING is
	selected; otherwise link errors ensue if only USE_ASSERTS is
	enabled.

1998-10-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>
        PR 17914

	* src/simple.cxx (CYG_NO_THREADID): Set if there is no Kernel
	support.

1998-10-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/null.cxx:
	Removed fix for PR 17471 since the required macros have been moved
	to cyg_type.h.

	* include/diag.h (diag_printf):
	* src/diag.c (diag_printf):
	Made use of variadic arguments optional in this function.

	* include/pkgconf/infra.h:
	Added configury to support buffered tracing.

	* src/fancy.cxx (trim_func):
	Fixed fencepost bug.

	* src/PKGconf.mak:
	* src/buffer.cxx:
	Added buffer.cxx to implement buffered trace log.

Thu Oct 15 21:27:23 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/delete.cxx, src/memcpy.c, src/memset.c:
	Moved here from ecc/kernel/current/src/common, as they should
	be present even if the kernel is disabled

	* include/pkgconf/infra.h:
	Add new config options CYGIMP_INFRA_PREFER_SMALL_TO_FAST_MEMCPY
	and CYGIMP_INFRA_PREFER_SMALL_TO_FAST_MEMSET to support the
	functionality available in memcpy.c and memset.c

	* src/PKGconf.mak:
	build above new files

	Above changes are required for PR 17229

1998-10-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/cyg_type.h:
	Moved CYG_LABEL_NAME() macro here from ktypes.h.

Wed Oct 14 17:10:12 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/diag.c: 
	Change warning message from previous change to match compiler
	output exactly

Tue Oct 13 17:23:37 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>
	
	* src/diag.c: 
	Output another warning so that people know that diag.c produces
	a warning
	Reformat to 76 columns
	Change args of diag_printf to be ANSI-style, not K&R to
	silence warning

1998-09-25  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/null.cxx:
	PR 17471: null.cxx relies on the macro CYG_LABEL_NAME(), which on
	the mn10300 is defined only if <cyg/kernel/ktypes.h> is included.
	As a temporary fix this header file is now always included. In the
	medium term there will have to be proper fixes to ktypes.h and to
	cyg_type.h 

Wed Sep 16 03:42:16 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/startup.cxx, src/dummyxxmain.cxx: 
	Move __main() to a separate dummyxxmain.cxx source file to resolve
	linking bogosities on some targets
	Fix for PR 17279 - kudos to Tim Goodwin really

	* src/PKGconf.mak:
	Build src/dummyxxmain.cxx

Tue Sep 15 19:14:33 1998  David Moore  <dsm@keema.cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/infra.h: Cleaned up comments.

Tue Sep 15 14:34:34 1998  David Moore  <dsm@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/startup.cxx: 
	* include/cyg_type.h: 
	CYGBLD_ATTRIB_WEAK moved from src/startup.cxx to
 	include/cyg_type.h

Tue Sep 15 12:26:36 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@peshwari.cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/null.cxx, src/simple.cxx, src/fancy.cxx:
 	Change cyg_check_data_ptr() to not compare with _end symbol from
	linker scripts as this is a bogus thing to do when starting in
	ROM. Some better magic can be done later with the memory layout
	tool.

	* src/simple.cxx (cyg_assert_fail),
	  src/fancy.cxx (cyg_assert_fail): 
	If an assert is thrown, loop forever no matter what the platform
	rather than resetting the jmr board.

Fri Sep 11 12:52:59 1998  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/tcdiag.cxx: 
	* src/diag.c: 
	Remove dependencies on the kernel:
	 o types are available from here, infra.
	 o Diag and its mates are here and the HAL.
	
Thu Sep 10 21:59:09 1998  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/fancy.cxx: 
	* src/simple.cxx: 
	* src/null.cxx: 
	Remove dependencies on the kernel:
 	 o interrupt stuff is available	from the HAL.
	 o types are available from here, infra.
	 o Diag and its mates are here and the HAL.
	 o Only consider printing thread information if there is a kernel.
	
Thu Sep 10 21:29:55 1998  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/infra.h: 
	Fix CDL descriptions (mainly) resulting from review of
	configury here.

Thu Sep 10 17:38:00 1998  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/null.cxx: 
	Add an empty cyg_assert_fail() if not CYGDBG_USE_ASSERTS, so that
 	clib's assert() can use it, in common with but regardless of the
	internal assert setup.  Of course if internal asserts are used,
	the same routine is used.

Thu Sep  3 19:05:29 1998  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/startup.cxx (__main): 
	...and its mates.  Correct the bad usage of the tracing macros - a
	type was implied when the type was void, so an assert fires.

	* include/diag.h (diag_printf): 
	Remove 'useful' prototype; this function deliberately has a K&R
	prototype to avoid having to use varargs, or pad arglists or
	anything grody like that.  Comment to that effect added too.
	
	* src/fancy.cxx: 
	Condition out routines which are only used by tracing system;
	prevent warnings.  Also changed the default widths setup to
	something more suitable to our long function names; viewing on
	about a 200 column screen recommended - or use 'simple' instead.

Tue Sep  1 19:09:39 1998  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@masala.cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/infra.h: 
	Fancy tracing by default, as I've been requested.
	Move definition (or not) of CYGDBG_INFRA_DIAG_USE_DEVICE from the
	kernel, correcting the symbol construction as we go.

	* include/cyg_type.h: 
	Correct multiple-inclusion protection, remove
	<dollar>Version<Dollar> nonsense, correct Usage: field, put in
	definition of CYGBLD_NORET.

	* include/cyg_ass.h: 
	Correct Usage: field, remove definition of CYGDBG_NORET, correct
 	definition of cyg_assert_fail to use CYGBLD_NORET as intended.

	* include/cyg_trac.h: 
	Tidy up comments.

	* src/PKGconf.mak (COMPILE): 
	Added all the new units below.

	* src/fancy.cxx: 
	* src/simple.cxx: 
	* src/null.cxx: 
	Moved here from the kernel; comments changed accordingly.

	* src/tcdiag.cxx: 
	* include/diag.h: 
	* src/diag.c: 
	Moved here from the kernel; comments changed accordingly.
	Also use config symbol CYGDBG_INFRA_DIAG_USE_DEVICE rather than
	(badly named) CYG_DIAG_USE_DEVICE.

Fri Aug 28 15:22:16 1998  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/infra.h: 
	Add lots of lovely cdl comments and new, correct, names for the
	config options themselves.
	* include/cyg_trac.h: 
	* include/cyg_ass.h: 
	Use the newly named options.

	[KERNEL] see also changes to src/trace/{fancy,null,simple}.cxx
	which should soon move into this package instead.

Fri Aug 28 09:57:21 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/infra.h:
	Add CYGSEM_START_ISO_C_COMPATIBILITY and
	CYGSEM_START_UITRON_COMPATIBILITY options, along with some comment.

	* src/PKGconf.mak, src/startup.cxx:
	Add these two files for the new file startup.cxx that provides the
	generic startup mechanism, using new cyg_start() functions. This
	is to remove the dependency on main(), which is defined in ISO and
	POSIX as having certain properties we wouldn't be able to give it
	otherwise.

Tue Aug 25 11:47:58 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/startup.cxx: 
	Add this to provide new startup method

1998-08-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/cyg_type.h:
	Moved constructor priority ordering stuff here from
	kernel/ktypes.h.
