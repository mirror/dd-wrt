2004-09-27  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/stdio.cdl (CYGFUN_LIBC_STDIO_OPEN_POSIX_FDFUNCS): New option,
	to control whether or not fdopen()/fileno() are implemented.
	Only build fopen/fclose if CYGPKG_LIBC_STDIO_OPEN.

	* src/common/fclose.cxx: Can remove ifdef CYGPKG_LIBC_STDIO_OPEN since
	file now isn't even built if not.
	* src/common/fopen.cxx: Ditto. Also condition on
	CYGFUN_LIBC_STDIO_OPEN_POSIX_FDFUNCS so decision is centralised in CDL.

2004-08-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/stdio.cdl (CYGDAT_LIBC_STDIO_DEFAULT_CONSOLE): Only use
	CYGDAT_IO_SERIAL_TTY_CONSOLE if set.

2004-08-18  Fredrik Hederstierna  <fredrik@wespot.com>
2004-08-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/input/vfscanf.cxx (vfscanf): Add long long and long double
	support.
	* cdl/stdio.cdl (CYGFUN_LIBC_STDIO_LONGLONG): Make it a new option.

2004-08-16  Oyvind Harboe <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

	* src/common/stream.cxx (read): fixed performance problem with
	unbuffered reads. Long unbuffered i/o read requests would cause
	one roundtrip to the underlying file system for each byte, instead
	of a single trip as intended.

2004-03-29  Kelvin Lawson <klawson@ad-holdings.co.uk>

	* src/common/fopen.cxx:
	* src/common/stream.cxx:
	* include/io.inl:
	* include/stream.hxx:
	Split CYGSTREAM_READWRITE into CYGSTREAM_READWRITE_CREATE and
	CYGSTREAM_READWRITE_NOCREATE. This fixes fopen() with mode 'w+'
	which previously did not allow file creation.

2004-03-27  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/stream.inl (set_position): Flush the output buffer
	before seeking the underlying file otherwise the writes ends up in
	the wrong location in the file.
	
2004-03-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/common/fileops.cxx (tmpnam): Only close if open() succeded.

2004-03-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/input/vfscanf.cxx (vfscanf): Silence warning.

	* include/stdio.h:
	Add file operation functions which weren't here before!
	While I'm here, add __THROW everywhere and use __externC not externC.

	* cdl/stdio.cdl:  We implement stdio fileops in isoinfra now.
	Also set header for that.
	Build fileops.cxx.
	L_tmpnam must be at least 4.
	TMP_MAX must be at least 1, and ISO C says it should be >=25.
	Add description for CYGPKG_LIBC_STDIO_FILEIO and move up from
	bottom so it goes with others.

	* src/common/fileops.cxx: New file. Implements rename(), remove(),
	tmpnam() and tmpfile().

	* src/common/fclose.cxx: Add throw specifiers to match stdio.h.
	* src/common/feof.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/common/fflush.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/common/fopen.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/common/freopen.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/common/fseek.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/common/setvbuf.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/common/snprintf.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/common/sprintf.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/common/sscanf.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/common/stdioinlines.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/common/ungetc.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/common/vsnprintf.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/common/vsscanf.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/input/fgetc.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/input/fgets.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/input/fread.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/input/fscanf.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/input/gets.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/input/scanf.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/input/vfscanf.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/output/fnprintf.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/output/fprintf.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/output/fputc.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/output/fputs.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/output/fwrite.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/output/printf.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/output/vfnprintf.cxx: Ditto.
	
2004-02-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/stdio.cdl (CYGSEM_LIBC_STDIO_THREAD_SAFE_STREAMS): Can
	be inactive when no kernel.
	* cdl/stdio.cdl: Implements file positioning functions in isoinfra.

2003-09-03  Thomas Koeller <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

	* cdl/stdio.cdl: only require "/dev/haldiag" if actually using it.

2003-08-12  Scott Wilkinson <scott@alliantnetworks.com>
	
	* src/common/fclose.cxx (fclose): fclose would seg-fault if passed
        NULL FILE pointer.  Now returns error.  Also cleaned up some exit
        paths to call Cyg_libc_stdio_files::unlock()

        * src/common/fopen.cxx (fopen): Cleaned up some exit paths to call
        Cyg_libc_stdio_files::unlock()

2003-06-10  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>
	    Knud Wöhler  <woehler@ossi.fho-emden.de>    
	
	* src/output/vfnprintf.cxx (SARG): Cast size_t to long. This seems
	to stop gcc from producing wrong code for the plain int clause. The 
	wrong code causes negative numbers to be printed as positive because
	the sign extend from 32 bits to 64 bits is wrong.

2003-03-06  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/input/fread.cxx (fread): Simple EOF should not set error.

	* tests/fileio.c: New file.
	* cdl/stdio.cdl: Add new file I/O tests.

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/stdio.cdl: Fix doc link.

2003-02-15  Fabrice Gautier  <Fabrice_Gautier@sdesigns.com>

	* include/stdio.inl (setbuf): Don't supply size with _IONBF.
	* src/common/stdioinlines.cxx (setbuf): Ditto.

2003-01-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/output/vfnprintf.cxx: Add support for C99 'z' flag (size_t).

2002-09-02  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/stream.inl (set_position): Fixed typo in none buffered
	case. Seek pos bytes, not whence bytes.

2002-05-17  Martin Buck  <martin.buck@ascom.ch>
 
 	* include/stdio.h (fnprintf): Added printf-format-checking using
 	CYGBLD_ATTRIB_PRINTF_FORMAT, since gcc does it automatically only for
 	ISO C90 functions.
 	(snprintf) Likewise.
 
2002-04-24  Yoshinori Sato  <qzb04471@nifty.ne.jp>

	* include/streambuf.inl (Cyg_StdioStreamBuffer constructor): 
	Don't set default args in func definition.
	(set_buffer): Ditto.

2002-04-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/input/fgetc.cxx (fgetc): Silence conversion warning.

2002-04-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/common/fopen.cxx (fopen_inner): Allocate memory using malloc and
	placement new, not default new.

	* src/input/fgetc.cxx (fgetc): Don't set error on true EOF.

2002-04-04  Jurica Baricevic  <jura@INTESIS.hr>

	* src/common/fclose.cxx (fclose): Use delete if we can.

2002-02-06  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/input/fread.cxx (fread): when looping read into ptrc, not ptr!

2002-01-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/stream.inl (set_position): Fix the seek backwards case again.
	Doh!

2002-01-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/stream.inl (set_position): Fix the posdiff == 0 case.

2002-01-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/stream.inl (set_position): Check that posdiff is >0
	before taking the code path that assumes so.

2002-01-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/stream.inl (set_position): Use an off_t for bytesavail to
	prevent warnings.

2001-12-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/common/fflush.cxx (cyg_libc_stdio_flush_all_but): Fix starvation
	problem when waiting for threads to unlock of lower priority.
	Fix for bug #57014.

2001-11-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/stdio.cdl: Add dependency on stdlib string conversion functions
	for *scanf.

2001-08-10  Robin Farine  <robin.farine@terminus.org>

        * src/output/vfnprintf.cxx (cvt): Handles the cases of finite,
        NaN and infinite numbers separately.

	* src/common/stream.cxx (read): Read correct number of bytes when
	a character has been "ungot".

2001-08-03  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/streambuf.inl (~Cyg_StdioStreamBuffer): use correct configury
	to decide when to call free.

2001-07-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/common/fflush.cxx (cyg_libc_stdio_flush_all_but): The check
	for last operation being a read is only valid in buffered IO mode.

2001-07-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/stream.inl (set_position): Take read buffer into account
	when seeking. Thanks to jjtsai <jjtsai@itri.org.tw> for the
	help.

2001-07-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/common/fflush.cxx (cyg_libc_stdio_flush_all_but): Don't
	flush a stream that was last used for reading - it doesn't need it.
	* include/stream.hxx: cyg_libc_stdio_flush_all_but needs to be a
	friend of class Cyg_StdioStream to do the above.

2001-06-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/input/fread.cxx (fread): Fix compilation problem with below
	change.

2001-06-15  Rob Jansen  <rwjansen@planet.nl>

	* src/input/fread.cxx (fread): Changed to read the requested amount
	of data items instead of stopping on CYG_LIBC_STDIO_BUFSIZE boundaries.

2001-06-08  Jeff Johnston  <jjohnstn@redhat.com>

	* src/input/vfscanf.cxx (vfscanf)[CYGINT_LIBC_I18N_MB_REQUIRED]: Added
	call to mbtowc_fn for current locale to process format string.
	Also added variable definitions needed in this circumstance.
	* src/output/vfnprintf.cxx (vfnprintf)[CYGINT_LIBC_I18N_MB_REQUIRED]: Ditto.
	(vfnprintf): Changed non-multibyte path to simply use the current
	character rather than call the C mbtowc function since only
	single byte characters would be possible. 

2001-03-19  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/common/stream.cxx (refill_read_buffer): Flush all streams here...
	(read): ...rather than here, or...
	(read_byte): ...here.
	This means less flushing, which improves performance.

	* src/input/fgets.cxx: Add a reminder comment to improve this later.
	* src/input/gets.cxx: Ditto.


2001-03-16  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/stream.hxx (class Cyg_StdioStream): Improve member visibility.

	* src/common/stream.cxx (refill_read_buffer): Ensure eof is set.
	* src/common/feof.cxx: New file. Implements the long lost
	feof(), ferror() and clearerr() functions which were MIA for
	no good reason.
	* cdl/stdio.cdl: Build it.

2001-03-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/stdio.cdl (CYGDAT_LIBC_STDIO_DEFAULT_CONSOLE): Default to
	tty default console.

	* src/input/fgets.cxx (fgets): Reimplement to work with EOF properly.
	Add tracing.
	* src/input/gets.cxx (gets): Ditto.

	* include/io.hxx, include/io.inl, include/stream.hxx,
	include/stream.inl, include/streambuf.hxx, include/streambuf.inl:
	Silence warnings from recent compilers.

2001-02-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/stdio.cdl (CYGPKG_LIBC_STDIO_OPEN): Implements
	CYGINT_ISO_STDIO_POSIX_FDFUNCS ( fileno() and fdopen() ).

2000-11-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/stdio.h: Make FILE array type larger to be more resistant
	against small data sections.
	Lose the cyg_libc_stdio_stdin/out/err definitions with macros for
	stdin/stdout/err since it can cause problems with libgcc exception
	code. Instead just make these extern FILE *s.
	* src/common/stderr.cxx:
	* src/common/stdin.cxx:
	* src/common/stdout.cxx:
	Define objects with init priority corresponding to order the fd's
	should be allocated where applicable.
	Define actual stdin, stdout, stderr externally visible constants to
	point to the streams.

	* cdl/stdio.cdl: Support CYGINT_ISO_STDIO_STREAMS interface

	* src/common/fopen.cxx (fdopen): return f as intended

2000-10-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/streambuf.inl: Adjust assertions to cope with buffers
	generated by sprintf and similar non-bound-buffer calls.

2000-08-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/io.inl: No need to include string.h

	* cdl/stdio.cdl: Add some more requires statements

2000-08-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/common/stream.cxx (Cyg_StdioStream::Cyg_StdioStream):
	Only call io_buf members conditionally.

2000-08-03  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/common/fseek.cxx: Include assertion and tracing support since
	they are used.

2000-07-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/stream.hxx (class Cyg_StdioStream): Added get_dev()
	accessor member function to return underlying device handle.

	* src/common/fopen.cxx: Added fdopen() and fileno(). Reorganized
	fopen() so that code common with fdopen() is now in a separate
	function.

	* src/common/stdiosupp.cxx (Cyg_libc_stdio_find_filename): Removed
	compiler warning.

2000-07-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/stdio.cdl: Added common/fseek.cxx to compile list.
	Reorganized options for stream buffering:
	CYGSEM_LIBC_STDIO_DYNAMIC_SETVBUF now controls whether the user
	can attach their own buffer to the stream.
	CYGSEM_LIBC_STDIO_SETVBUF_MALLOC controls whether buffers can be
	malloced or only statically defined.
	Added CYGPKG_LIBC_STDIO_FILEIO option to control whether the STDIO
	package uses the FILEIO package for all IO, or goes directly to
	the device drivers as before.

	* include/stdio.h: Added file positioning calls defined in section
	7.9.9 of the standard.

	* include/io.hxx: 
	* include/io.inl:
	Added these files to define an abstraction layer for access to the
	real device underlying an IO stream. Depending on
	CYGPKG_LIBC_STDIO_FILEIO this either goes to the FILEIO package or
	directly to the device drivers.
	
	* include/stream.hxx:
	Modifications to use io.hxx abstractions.
	Added second constructor for creating a buffer-only stream.
	Added initialize() function which contains most of the common
	stream initialization code.
	Added a close() member function.

	* include/stream.inl:
	Modifications to use io.hxx abstractions.
	Moved most of the work of the destructor into close() member.
	Added FILEIO version of set_position() member function.
	
	* include/streambuf.hxx:
	* include/streambuf.inl:
	* src/common/streambuf.cxx: 
	Rearranged to match new buffering configuration options.

	* src/common/stream.cxx:
	Modifications to use io.hxx abstractions.
	Added second constructor, and moved common initialization code to
	initialize() member function.
	Added code to make position member correctly track current file
	position.

	* src/common/fopen.cxx:
	Fixed handling of write/append in process_mode().
	Moved call of process_mode() to before call to cyg_stdio_open() so
	that stream modes may be passed in.
	Added code to detect an interactive stream and choose non-buffered
	mode - fully buffered is now the default.
	Added calls to cyg_stdio_close() where appropriate.

	* src/output/vfnprintf.cxx: Removed FLUSH() macro and its
	uses. Deciding to flush should be in the hands of the buffer code,
	or the user calling fflush().

	* src/common/vsscanf.cxx:
	Added FILEIO variant of vsscanf(). This uses a precharged stream
	object to emulate input.

	* src/common/vsnprintf.cxx: 
	Added FILEIO variant of vsnprintf(). This uses the standard stream
	object to print into the supplied buffer.
	
	* src/common/fseek.cxx:
	Added this file to implement file positioning functions.

	* src/common/fclose.cxx (fclose):
	Added call to Cyg_StdioStream::close().

	* include/stdiosupp.hxx:
	* src/common/stdiosupp.cxx: 
	Modified Cyg_libc_stdio_find_filename() to take mode, binary and
	append arguments.

	* src/common/stdin.cxx: 
	* src/common/stdout.cxx: 
	* src/common/stderr.cxx:
	Modified calls to Cyg_libc_stdio_find_filename() to pass
	appropriate values for mode, binary and append arguments.

2000-06-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/common/vsscanf.cxx: Add NULL select entry to DEVIO_TABLE
	* src/common/vsnprintf.cxx: Likewise

2000-05-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>
 
        * include/stream.inl (set_error): If the error is EEOF, set
        the EOF flag (flags.at_eof) so that clients know.
 
        * src/input/fgetc.cxx (__fgetc):
        * src/input/fgets.cxx (_fgets):
        * src/input/fread.cxx (_fread): Correctly handle an error,
        or EOF indication, from real_stream->refill_read_buffer().

2000-05-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* New package
	Separated original libc out into separate packages on functional
	boundaries.
	Header files are now managed by isoinfra package
	Plenty of cleanups done, but no major functionality changes
