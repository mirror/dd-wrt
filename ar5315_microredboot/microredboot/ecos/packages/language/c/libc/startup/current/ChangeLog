2003-03-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/mainthread.cxx: Align stack to relevant architecture alignment.

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/startup.cdl: Fix doc link.

2002-04-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/_exit.cxx (_exit): Assert on non-zero error.

2001-10-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/invokemain.cxx (cyg_libc_invoke_main): CYGINT_ISO_PTHREAD_IMPL
	needs #ifdef not #if now.

2000-12-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/startup.cdl: Allow others to say whether main() can be invoked
	elsewhere.
	Use defaults for startup context implementor using above interface
	rather than POSIX pthread package.
	Allow main() stack to be visible for other implementors, except
	when called from the init context since the stack size isn't used
	there, or when the implementation says it doesn't use it.
	Define an interface to express that the stack size option
	isn't used in such cases.
	
2000-10-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/startup.cdl (CYGSEM_LIBC_INVOKE_DEFAULT_STATIC_CONSTRUCTORS):
	Special case for POSIX package startup since we know it calls
	cyg_libc_invoke_main() rather than main directly.

2000-08-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/invokemain.cxx: Declare cyg_hal_stop_constructors

2000-07-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/cstartup.cxx: Fix typo

2000-07-19  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/startup.cdl:
	Make a "radio button" choice between how main() gets invoked (eCos
	thread vs. cyg_user_start vs. someone else doing it)

	* src/mainthread.cxx: Move cyg_libc_dummy_constructor_class to
	src/invokemain.cxx

	* src/invokemain.cxx: Invoke pthread_exit() instead of exit() if
	relevant

	* src/cstartup.cxx:
	Only fiddle with cyg_user_start() if
	CYGSEM_LIBC_STARTUP_MAIN_INITCONTEXT defined

2000-07-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/abort.cxx: Fix configuration dependency on CYGINT_ISO_SIGNAL_IMPL

2000-05-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/startup.cdl (CYGSEM_LIBC_EXIT_STOPS_SYSTEM): 
	default to 0 always

2000-05-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* New package
	Separated original libc out into separate packages on functional
	boundaries.
	Header files are now managed by isoinfra package
	Plenty of cleanups done, but no major functionality changes
