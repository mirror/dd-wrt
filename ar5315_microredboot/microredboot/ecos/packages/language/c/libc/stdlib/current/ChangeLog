	string conversion.
	* cdl/stdlib.cdl (CYGFUN_LIBC_STDLIB_CONV_LONGLONG): New option
	to build above new files configurably.
	* include/atox.inl: Prototype new functions from above. Add atoll()
	inline.

2004-02-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	(rand): Ditto.

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/stdlib.cdl: Fix doc link.

2001-06-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

2001-06-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/stdlib.cdl: requires string functions, so say so.

2001-02-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/rand.cxx: Fix typo

2000-08-03  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/getenv.cxx: Revert nickg's change of 2000-06-07. environ is
	meant to be determined by the startup environment (normally in
	CYGPKG_LIBC_STARTUP), not getenv.

2000-07-27  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/stdlib.cdl: Require CYGINT_ISO_CTYPE because we need the iswhite()
	etc. funs

	* cdl/stdlib.cdl: Remove all parts of malloc implementation and
	move to new separate package CYGPKG_MEMALLOC

	* src/malloc.cxx, tests/malloc1.c, tests/malloc2.c, tests/malloc3.c,
	tests/realloc.c: remove - moved to CYGPKG_MEMALLOC

2000-06-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/realloc.c: Include correct pkgconf file.

	* src/getenv.cxx: Removed externC from definition of environ, so
	that is actually gets defined.

2000-05-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* New package
	Separated original libc out into separate packages on functional
	boundaries.
	Header files are now managed by isoinfra package
