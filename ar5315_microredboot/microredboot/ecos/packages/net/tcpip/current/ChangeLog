	* include/netinet/in.h: Prototype for inet_ntoa_r()

2003-11-25  Manu Sharma <manu.sharma@ascom.com>
        * src/sys/net/bridgestp.c: Code for Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).

        * cdl/openbsd_net.cdl: Changes make provisions for STP code.

2003-09-22  Reinhard Jessich  <Reinhard.Jessich@frequentis.com>

	* include/net/if.h: Define macro IF_IS_EMPTY needed by eth_drv.c

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/openbsd_net.cdl: Improve doc links.

2003-01-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/sys/net/if_bridge.c (bridge_input): Learn source host addr,
	not dest host addr.
	Fix pointed to by Daniel Néri.

2002-12-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/sys/netinet/tcp_usrreq.c (tcp_usrreq): Rearranged ifndef on
	PRU_SENSE case to keep the case in the switch and let it return a
	sensible result. Otherwise a stat() on a socket causes a panic().

2002-12-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c (show_network_tables): New function used
	to print network information (interface, routing).

2002-05-21  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/recv.c: Fix warning. socket.h declarations are not
	available to the kernel code. Added missing argument in the
	recvfrom call.

2002-05-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/netinet6/in6.h: Fixed warnings.

	* src/sys/kern/uipc_socket2.c (sblock): Fixed warning.
	* src/sys/netinet/tcp_input.c: Same.
	* src/sys/net/if_loop.c (looutput): Same.
	* src/sys/kern/sockio.c: Same.

	* include/sys/param.h: Include machine headers after the namespace
	changing macros to get the desired declarations, thus fixing
	compiler warnings.

2002-04-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/netinet/ip_input.c: Proper "extern" definition of 'ipstat'.

	* src/sys/netinet/raw_ip.c: 
	* src/sys/netinet/ip_output.c: 
	* include/netinet/ip_var.h: Use of ramdom IP packet id is optional.

2002-04-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/netinet/tcp_usrreq.c: 
	* src/sys/netinet/tcp_output.c: 
	* src/sys/netinet/tcp_input.c: 
	* src/sys/netinet/tcp_debug.c: 
	* include/netinet/tcp_debug.h: Fully conditionalize on TCPDEBUG.

2002-03-27  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* doc/openbsd.sgml: Manpages now live in "common" BSD package.

2002-03-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/net/route.c (cyg_route_reinit): Renamed from route_reinit.

2002-03-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com> 

	[Case 107110]

	* src/sys/netinet/in.c (in_control): SIOCSIFADDR switch entry
	moved to before the scan for this same address being in the list
	already, along with Add and Delete (SIOCAIFADDR,SIOCDIFADDR) arms.
	It falls through into the same alloc-if-needed code anyway.
	Thus repeatedly setting the same address does not leak store.

	* src/sys/net/route.c (route_reinit): Rewrite to delete all routes
	individually rather than en-masse (leaking store).
	(rt_reinit_rtdelete): New function; callback for individual
	deletion.
	(rtioctl): Do not pass in a "route **" to return a pointer to the
	route removed or added; this results in an extra reference, by the
	returned pointer, and so a storeleak.
	(rtrequest): RTM_DELETE arm: do not free a gateway route if the
	gateway pointer is the same as the route itself - it gets freed
	*again* at the end of the routine if you do.  Just dec the refcnt.

2002-03-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/sys/param.h: Privatize route_reinit(), arc4random().

2002-02-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2002-02-28  Martin Buck <martin.buck@ascom.ch>

	* src/sys/net/if_ethersubr.c (ether_input): [Bugzilla 60318]
	ether_input() schedules processing by calling schednetisr(FOO) and
	then queues the frame afterwards.  Where we cannot be preempted
	eg. in a DSR or in the original BSD kernel, this is OK.  In eCos
	the call to schednetisr(FOO) might cause a context switch *before*
	the frame is enqueued.  This "jams" one packet in the queue,
	delaying it until the next packet, and so on.

	This change makes ether_input() store up the schednetisr() arg
	until the end, and do the call then, much like it does with the
	queue to use.  Thanks Martin!

2002-02-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* doc/openbsd.sgml: New file; separated stack-specific docs from
	monolithic net doc, and tidied up in various ways.

2002-02-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/openbsd_net.cdl: Slight changes in layout required by split
	of network stacks.

2002-02-13  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>
2002-02-13  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/sys/mbuf.h: Declare variables as extern in header.
	* src/sys/kern/uipc_mbuf.c: Define mbtypes[] and init it.

2002-02-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/openbsd_net.cdl: Place this package below  CYGPKG_NET
	ie. the common networking package.  Only affects the view in the
	GUI CT, no big deal.

2002-01-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/netinet/ip_input.c: inet_ntoa() is now common.

	* cdl/openbsd_net.cdl: Renamed from net.cdl.  This package
	is now a proper sub-package, implementing a network stack.

2002-01-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Clarify CYGPKG_NET_ROUTING description.

2002-01-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/server_test.c (server_test): Correct port conversion.

2001-12-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/net/if_ethersubr.c (ether_output): Never ever print
	anything!  It can recurse unexpectedly if debugging over net.

2001-12-10  Andrew Lunn <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Add configury to eliminate network timing stats.
	* src/include/machine/param.h: Timing statistics for things like 
	memcpy, mbuf_alloc etc now use configury to determine if the
	statistics code should be compiled.
	* src/ecos/support.c: Ditto.
	* tests/nc_test_slave.c: Only print timing stats when they
	are enabled. 
	* tests/tcp_echo.c: Ditto.
	* tests/nc_test_master.c: Allow building with SNMP lib which has
	its own gettimeofday(). This should be fixed better a different
	way but will do for now.
	
2001-12-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/bootp_support.c (init_net): Just re-tabbed and checked
	the addition to initialize DNS from DHCP info - it had already
	snuck into the file in the previous change from Andrew.  Include
	of netdb.h added also, from the patch in Bug 57019.  Also check
	CYGINT_ISO_DNS for the setup code instead of CYGPKG_ISO_DNS.

2001-12-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/bootp_support.c: Check CYGINT_ISO_DNS (from
	<pkgconf/isoinfra.h>) instead of CYGPKG_ISO_DNS.

2001-12-03   Andrew Lunn  <Andrew.Lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/lib/bootp_support.c: get_bootp_option(): Take the
	max length of data we want out of the bootp record.
	* src/lib/dhcp_prot.c: Pass the length we expect for an option.

2001-08-16  Anssi Pulkkinen <Anssi.Pulkkinen@ascom.ch>

	* src/lib/dhcp_prot.c: Make sure we use the newly calculated xid.
	
2001-08-02  Anand Srivastava <Anand.Srivastava@ascom.ch>

        * src/lib/dhcp_prot.c do_dhcp: ID calculation must be done only
	once. moved it out the loop. 	
	
2001-11-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/dhcp_support.c (dhcp_mgt_entry): If we have an
	SNMPAGENT, must recycle it whenever we reinitialize all
	interfaces; call SnmpdShutDown() to cause this.
	Also re-initialize all loopback interfaces here too.	

2001-11-30  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/dhcp_prot.c (set_default_dhcp_tags): New routine to
	insert all the extra woffle we need neatly each time, keeping the
	state machine's case arms to the real work.  The new thing this
	sets is TAG_DHCP_PARM_REQ_LIST, with a list that matches the
	default set we get from a LINUX dhcpd.  This is because M$ servers
	need explicit requests for eg. TAG_GATEWAY.  Note that I have
	included configuration to override the set of tags requested here
	in the source, but not yet backed up by CDL - we'll see whether
	anyone needs this.
	(set_variable_tag): New routine to insert a variable pointed-to
	data item rather than an int of 1,2 or 4 bytes.
	(do_dhcp): Call set_default_dhcp_tags() every time we send a
	packet, rather than ad hoc additions in each state.

2001-11-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/machine/ansi.h: No longer require BSD string function
	compatibility macros (in fact they confuse things).

	* cdl/net.cdl: Require BSD compatibility functions from <string.h>.

2001-11-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/bootp.h (BP_STD_TX_MINPKTSZ): New symbol defining the
	minimal DHCP packet size which we should send.

	* src/lib/dhcp_prot.c (scan_dhcp_size): New routine to scan up to
	the end of the packet, for length determination and padding.
	(dhcp_size): Now uses scan_dhcp_size().
	(dhcp_size_for_send): New, uses scan_dhcp_size() and pads with
	zero up to the min packet size that we should send.
	(do_dhcp): In every sendto() call, use dhcp_size_for_send(xmit) in
	order to send padded, full size packets as needed.  5 instances.

	Credit to "Anssi Pulkkinen" <Anssi.Pulkkinen@ascom.ch> for the
	original version of this patch.

2001-11-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/server_test.c (net_test): Fix compile error.

2001-11-02  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c: 
	* include/machine/ansi.h: Add C++ support [externC].

2001-11-11  Andrew Lunn <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	*src/lib/recv.c: Implement the recv() call.

2001-10-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/net/if_ethersubr.c (ether_output): [CASE 106613] Even if
	the queue is full, and we are dropping the packet, try to start
	the interface anyway, to give it a chance to empty the queue if
	the device has recovered from whatever made the queue fill up in
	the first place - being unplugged from the network for example.
	This change is belt & braces with a similar policy in the periodic
	tickle function in the logical ether driver in io/eth/... ; this
	change will recover the situation immediately if the application
	continues trying to send despite ENOBUFS.

2001-10-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/net/if_bridge.c (bridge_broadcast): Count if_obytes in
	destination interfaces as well as the bridge interface; normally
	this is done in if_ethersubr.c but here we talk directly to the
	interface, bypassing that layer.  Thanks to Andrew Lunn for
	noticing that.

2001-10-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/netinet/in.c (in_lifaddr_ioctl): Silence warnings about
	trigraphs.

2001-10-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/ftp_test.c (net_test): This was lacking #ifdefs for
	CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH0 and CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH1.  Ooops.

2001-10-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/net.cdl (CYGPKG_NET_CFLAGS_ADD): Define __INSIDE_NET within
	this package to allow segregation of definitions only relevant for
	internal consumption, and definitions allowable for external
	consumption.

	* include/lib/libkern/libkern.h: Conditionalize on __INSIDE_NET.

2001-10-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/net.cdl (CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH0): Make flavor bool so it isn't
	defined when 0.
	(CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH1): Ditto.

2001-10-04  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/dhcp_support.c: Some conditional compilation tags were
	wrong vis a vis ETH1 versus ETH0.  Thanks to "Simon"
	<simoncc@ms46.url.com.tw> for spotting it.

2001-10-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/multi_lo_select.c (cyg_user_start): Added CYG_TEST_INIT
	call.
	* tests/ping_lo_test.c (cyg_start): Same.
	* tests/tcp_lo_test.c (cyg_start): Same.
	* tests/udp_lo_test.c (cyg_start): Same.
	* tests/tcp_lo_select.c (cyg_start): Same.

2001-09-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Tell isoinfra we support getproto* and getserv*
	NS functionality.
	* include/netdb.h: Move to...
	* include/net/netdb.h: ...here.

2001-09-25  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Don't build tests/nc_test_master as it's a host
	side tool.

	* src/lib/getserv.c: Added domain service.

	* include/netdb.h: Moved getbyhost()/getbyaddr() declarations and
	hostent struct definition to the DNS package. 

	* src/lib/gethost.c: Removed.

	* cdl/net.cdl: Removed gethost.c (replaced by proper
	implementation in CYGPKG_NS_DNS).

2001-09-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2001-09-17  Andrew Lunn <Andrew.Lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/sys/net/if_bridge.c (bridge_broadcast): Fix a null pointer
	deference.  Supporting VLANs, it seems that during the net_init()
	function, it sends a packet to the bridge with the source
	interface being NULL.  Stats counting assumed otherwise.

2001-09-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/kern/uipc_syscalls.c: Last change to uipc_syscalls.c
	wasn't right. The parts that were __ECOS__ should simply have
	been completely removed.

2001-09-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Add configury to control whether we can tickle the
	network devices if there's a lack of network traffic, and to
	control the delay time before so doing.

	* src/ecos/timeout.c (alarm_thread): Use a timed wait, if so
	configured, for the flag; and if it times out, tickle all the
	devices via the common ether driver routine for so doing.

2001-09-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/sys/socketvar.h: Use __ECOS, not __ECOS__.
	* src/sys/kern/uipc_syscalls.c: Ditto.
	* src/sys/kern/uipc_socket2.c (sblock): Ditto.

2001-08-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/linux_echo.c (echo_test): Set socket options before bind.
	* tests/nc_test_slave.c (do_tcp_test): Ditto.
	* tests/server_test.c (server_test): Ditto.
	* tests/tcp_echo.c (echo_test): Ditto.
	* tests/tcp_lo_test.c (server): Ditto.
	* tests/tcp_sink.c (sink_test): Ditto.
	* tests/tcp_source.c (source_test): Ditto.

2001-07-27  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/sys/select.h: Renamed to....
	* include/sys/bsdselect.h: New file.
	* include/sys/socketvar.h: Include <sys/bsdselect.h> instead of
	<sys/select.h>
	* src/lib/select.c: Include <sys/bsdselect.h>

2001-07-26  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/net.cdl (CYGPKG_NET_API_LOCAL): Implements select()
	* include/sys/bsdtypes.h: No need for these select definitions.

2001-06-20  Grant Edwards <grante@visi.com>
2001-06-20  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/dhcp_prot.c (alarm_function): Change the lease state
	before re-enabling the alarm so that if it somehow gets times of
	zero (ie. right now) it quickly completes the state machine rather
	than recursing to its doom.
	(new_lease): Test the retcode of get_bootp_option() and use
	obvious defaults if the T1 and T2 times are not provided - this is
	RFC compliant! - and use "infinite lease" if the lease time is not
	provided at all.

2001-06-19  Trenton D. Adams  <tadams@extremeeng.com>

	* tests/server_test.c (server_test): Null terminate read string
	at right place.

2001-06-13  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Make debug output an option. Include DHCP.

	* src/lib/dhcp_prot.c: DHCP_CHATTER -> CYGDBG_NET_DHCP_CHATTER

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_kmem_init): Only print debug output if
	requested.

	* cdl/net.cdl: Make requirements on other eCos features more
	abstract.

2001-05-09  Robin Farine <acnrf@dial.eunet.ch>
2001-05-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/dhcp_prot.c (do_dhcp): In DHCPSTATE_INIT case, create a
	new xid.  Servers apparantly can use *only* this to distinguish
	machines, even with different MAC addresses!  Therefore we use
	both the most sensitive randomizer available (arc4random()) which
	in reality uses a finegrain clock, and salt the value further with
	the MAC address itself.  Thanks again Robin.

	* src/ecos/support.c (arc4random): Make arc4random not always be a
	multiple of 256; stir the clock into the low bits also.

2001-05-09  Robin Farine <acnrf@dial.eunet.ch>
2001-05-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/net/if_bridge.c: Patch from Robin; the route aging
	process took twice as long to timeout because an entry requires
	*two* executions of bridge_rtage() to actually get removed.
	Record the timeout over 2 to fix that and also define
	BRIDGE_RTABLE_TIMEOUT as 300s that the standard specifies as
	default aging time.

2001-05-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/getserv.c (setreturned): New routine to set up a copy of
	the service data with the port converted to network order like the
	API demands.  It's this way to make the initialization of the
	table most readable.  
	(services[]): Added an entry for snmp.
	(getservbyname): Use setreturned() to return adjusted info.
	(getservbyport): Use setreturned() to return adjusted info and
	compare with host-ordered version of the port.

	* src/lib/tftp_client.c (tftp_get): 
	(tftp_put): Do not convert to net order from
	the getserv structure; it's already net order.

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c (tftpd_server): Convert the socket into
	host order; it's network order in the getserv API.

	* tests/ftp_test.c (ftp_test): Do not convert to net order from
	the getserv structure; it's already net order.

	* tests/tftp_client_test.c (PUTFILE): Changed the names of the
	test files to be fully qualified, this makes the test work with
	more server machines.  /tftpboot/tftp_get and /tftpboot/tftp_put.
	
2001-04-24  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* cdl/net.cdl:
	Prevent multiple device drivers from implementing the
	same eth0/eth1 device.

2001-03-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/net.cdl (CYGPKG_NET_SYSCTL): Comment out - currently unsupported.

2001-03-28  Richard Panton  <rpanton@3glab.com>

	* include/bootp.h: Define func protos with C linkage
	* include/netdb.h: Ditto
	* include/network.h: Ditto
	* include/tftp_support.h: Ditto

	* src/lib/getserv.c: getservbynumber() -> getservbyport()	

2001-03-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/network_support.c (init_all_network_interfaces): 
	FIx slightly broken previous attempt in abort code.

2001-03-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/network_support.c (init_all_network_interfaces): 
	Let initialization of PCMCIA devices abort after ~5 seconds.

2001-02-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c (STACK_SIZE): Align

2001-02-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Avoid puts to the CDL header when a CDL
	define will do.
	Rename CYGPKG_NET_BRIDGE_CODE -> CYGPKG_NET_BRIDGE
	Rename CYGPKG_NET_NBRIDGE -> CYGNUM_NET_BRIDGES
	Rename CYGPKG_NET_BRIDGE_HANDLER -> CYGINT_NET_BRIDGE_HANDLER
	Make if_bridge.c compilation conditional on CYGPKG_NET_BRIDGE

	* src/sys/net/if_bridge.c: Reflect above renames.

2001-02-20  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2001-02-15  Martin Buck  <martin.buck@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Split up CYGPKG_NET_NBRIDGE into 2 parts:
	CYGPKG_NET_NBRIDGE and CYGPKG_NET_BRIDGE_HANDLER. If
	CYGPKG_NET_BRIDGE_HANDLER is nonzero, calls to an Ethernet
	bridge are inserted into the stack's data path. If
	CYGPKG_NET_NBRIDGE is nonzero, the standard OpenBSD bridge
	code is added. This setup allows you to implement your own
	bridge as a separate package which then implements
	CYGPKG_NET_BRIDGE_HANDLER so it gets called by the stack.
	NBRIDGE now is the same as CYGPKG_NET_BRIDGE_HANDLER instead
	of CYGPKG_NET_NBRIDGE. This means it's nonzero if the bridge
	is wanted, but it no longer contains the number of bridge
	buffers requested. This shouldn't be a problem, because the
	only place where the actual number of buffers is required is
	in if_bridge.c, which now uses CYGPKG_NET_NBRIDGE instead
	of NBRIDGE.

	* src/sys/net/if_bridge.c: Use CYGPKG_NET_NBRIDGE instead of
	NBRIDGE, because the latter one now only means that there is
	a bridge, not that we should implement it.

2001-01-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c: 
	* cdl/net.cdl: 	Add interface 'CYGPKG_NET_DRIVER_FRAMEWORK'
	to describe interdependencies between network stack and driver
	framework packages.


2001-01-03  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/linux_echo.c: New file to test for network bandwidth
	limitations in host side.  Builds to a linux version of the
	tcp_echo middleman.

	* tests/make.linux (all): Build linux_echo.

2001-01-03  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/dhcp.h (struct dhcp_lease): Define the semaphore pointer
	field in each lease structure.

	* src/lib/dhcp_support.c: Initialize the dhcp_lease structs to
	point to the semaphore "dhcp_needs_attention".

	* src/lib/dhcp_prot.c (alarm_function): Post to the semaphore
	pointed to in the lease structure, rather than one hard-coded.
	This is much cleaner, in that dhcp_prot.c now uses no external
	variables, all state goes through the API.

2000-11-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/bootp_support.c (init_net): Do a SIOCSIFADDR a 2nd time
	after setting the netmask (SIOCSIFNETMASK) in order for the newly
	set netmask to "take" - otherwise a bogus route based on the
	default netmask lurks within the system.

2000-11-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_net_get_mem_stats): New API for getting
	info on the various mem pools the stack uses to enable tests to
	spot store leaks.

	* include/network.h (cyg_net_get_mem_stats): Export this API for
	automated network testing.

2000-10-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c (tftpd_server): Cut down the chatter to
	nothing (unless there's an error) if running automated testing.

2000-10-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2000-10-10  Andrew Lunn <Andrew.Lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/ecos/support.c (setsoftnet,cyg_panic): Less chatter,
	particularly not when we're out of MBUFs.

2000-10-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2000-10-10  Andrew Lunn <Andrew.Lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/sys/net/if_bridge.c: Intergrated a more up to date version
	from the OpenBSD sources. This fixes a few bugs.

2000-10-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_ktime_init): Start time at 1 Second so
	that all visible time values are valid; offset time by 1 Second
	subsequently, for ever.

	* src/sys/netinet/if_ether.c (arpresolve): Undo the change below;
	instead make "kernel time" be valid ie. more than 1 second into
	its life.  Dumb stack assumes it takes UNIX-like time to start.

2000-10-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/netinet/if_ether.c (arpresolve): Deal with the initial
	case when the route timeout is zero (as initialized).  Otherwise
	it never actually sent out the initial ARP request packet.  This
	caused connect() not to work, and thus ftp_test, for example.

	* src/lib/dhcp_support.c (dhcp_start_dhcp_mgt_thread): Also
	initialize the dhcp semaphore here.  The other place it is init'd
	[correctly] didn't fire if we use the standard support.  Fixed
	some absent return value warnings.

2000-10-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c (tftpd_server): Modify the server to
	support multiple sessions - ie. starting N servers at once.
	Mainly this means closing the initial socket whilst servicing a
	request, so that another server can then bind to it; tell another
	server to retry that bind via a semaphore, that it waited on when
	the bind failed initially, rather than just returning.

	* src/lib/tftp_dummy_file.c (dummy_open): Trivial bugfix: scan the
	list of files as well as incrementing the counter.

2000-10-05  Andrew Lunn <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_ktime_func,cyg_ktime_init,cyg_net_init): 
	Make 'ktime' value valid.

2000-10-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c (tftpd_write_file): Restructure this
	function to match the loop layout of the tftpd_read_file; so that
	it retries sensibly, and so that a delayed/duplicated packet does
	not cause a doubling of all traffic with a less smart host.

2000-10-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/tftp_support.h (TFTP_TIMEOUT_MAX): Change this to 50; it
	refers to total timeouts for a whole session, so it should be
	greater than the retry count for each packet.

2000-10-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/tftp_dummy_file.c: Make the fake file slots be a Mb
	instead of 10k so that you can do meaningful timing tests with it.
	(dummy_open): Allow re-write of an existing file so that you can
	do repeated put tests without running out of slots.

2000-10-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/select.c (_cyg_select): Unlock the scheduler in a couple
	of other places I missed.  Doh.

2000-09-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/select.c (_cyg_select): Elect to wait for the flags
	atomically wrt sockets possibly becoming ready - this was a race
	condition that would apparently delay a packet until another
	arrived, eg. a tftp retry.  Then two came along all at once.

2000-09-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c: Add lots of instrumentation for
	debugging.  It's switched off, and doesn't have a real config opt,
	though it easily could have.

2000-09-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c (tftpd_read_file): Doh! TFTP_TIMEOUT is an
	internal API thing, not an error we can send in an ERROR packet.

	* include/tftp_support.h: Comment to this effect.

2000-09-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2000-09-25  Andrew Lunn <Andrew.Lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c: Send an ERROR packet when giving up after
	too many timeouts.  This should cause the client to give up as
	well.  Also moved all the replicated code to send an ERROR packet
	into one function.

	[Huge] I collected another point where we can use the common
	function also, and used ETIMEOUT instead of EBADOP for the new
	error packet returns. Thanks Andrew!
	
2000-09-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/net.cdl (CYGOPT_NET_DHCP_DHCP_THREAD_PARAM): Set default to
	1 so that the DHCP management thread loops forever.  This allows
	it to recover from a DHCP renewal failure.

	* src/lib/dhcp_prot.c (next_timeout): Harden the DHCP protocol
	machine against [simulated] failures - otherwise the tests with
	simulated failures tend just to close down all the interfaces when
	DHCP packets are lost.

2000-09-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/bootp_support.c (init_net): Set default route correctly.

2000-09-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_net_init): You can't print things while
	initializing the network!  Well, not if connected to GDB over the
	network anyway.  The printf("Init device '%s'...); removed.

2000-09-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* OVERVIEW: This is part of the change to the network stack to
	greatly reduce latencies both of (other) DSRs and of thread
	scheduling.  All the work that the network stack *and* individual
	ether drivers used to do in DSRs (including alarm callbacks and
	data copies to/from the device memory) is moved into a "fast
	network thread" instead.  It calls a device's "deliver" function
	to do the work that was previously in the DSR.  This is a separate
	thread so that it can be set higher priority than application
	threads in order to minimize packet loss (depending on the
	driver), if required (the application threads presumed to be
	higher priority in turn than the network thread).  A crucial
	consequence of this is that we are no longer locking against DSRs,
	so a plain mutex can be used rather than the global scheduler
	lock, thus simplifying all the splfoo/splx() style functions.

	* src/ecos/timeout.c (alarm_thread): Addition of the "fast network
	thread" which runs DSR-like activities.
	(do_timeout): Timeout function morphed for calling from that.
	(do_alarm, ecos_synch_eth_drv_dsr): new DSR functions to signal to
	the thread.
	(timeout): Race condition fixed.  splinternal() used for locking
	instead of scheduler.
	
	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_net_init): Splfoo/splx() functions,
	together with tsleep/wakeup functions, all removed to separate
	them from the mixed bag of utilities in this file.  What remains
	is mbuf wrapper routines and the like, plus the network "netisr"
	thread itself, the caller into the stack that does the slower
	priority work.

	* src/ecos/synch.c: New file; implemtation of new splfoo/splx()
	functions, together with tsleep/wakeup functions, since they are
	related now.

	* cdl/net.cdl: Compile new file synch.c; two new options, one for
	"fast thread" priority, and one for DHCP manager thread priority,
	as I was adding prio configury.  CYGPKG_NET_FAST_THREAD_PRIORITY
	and CYGPKG_NET_DHCP_THREAD_PRIORITY resp, with suitable default
	values relative to the CYGPKG_NET_THREAD_PRIORITY.

	* src/lib/dhcp_support.c (dhcp_start_dhcp_mgt_thread): Use the
	configured priority rather than just "net thread - 1"

2000-08-31  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/tcp_echo.c: Change the priorities of the main and loading
	threads to accommodate the network having helper threads around at
	adjacent priorities to its main thread prio.

2000-08-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sys/net/if.c (ifioctl): Support the two new ioctl() keys; at
	this level, the struct ifreq at the head of the data area must be
	filled to select an interface.

	* include/sys/sockio.h (SIOCGIFSTATSUD): Add two new eCos-only
	ioctl() keys, SIOCGIFSTATSUD and SIOCGIFSTATS, for reading
	statistical information out of ethernet devices, for SNMP. This
	should allow SNMP (a) to not explode, (b) to get useful info out
	of other device implementations than this one.

2000-08-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/ecos/timeout.c (timeout): Rework the timeout system to
	record last-time-we-set-the-alarm and whence values, so that new
	timeouts being added can be set up relative to the correct
	absolute time.  Otherwise adding a new timeout sets them *all*
	into the future by the expired portion of the previous minimum
	pending timeout.  Also deal better with recursion ie. timeout
	handlers themselves setting new timeouts as is only natural.
	Lots of asserts too.

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_splsoftnet): Use the new kernel facility
	to lock mutex &c atomically, with the scheduler locked already.
	(cyg_tsleep): Similarly, and reclaim the mutex likewise.
	Also added lots of asserts to both calls the better to document
	what's going on.

2000-08-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c: Fix contributors field.

2000-08-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c: Improvements to server wrt better error
	messages and detection of filesystem errors eg. on close-file.
	Contrib from ASCOM.  I tidied up some comments and indent to
	minimize the diff.  [CASE 104354]

2000-08-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* doc/bridge.html: New file...
	* doc/bridge.doc: New file...
	provided by ASCOM from the OpenBSD version.

2000-08-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sys/net/if_bridge.c (bridge_ioctl): SIOCBRDGSTO takes
	argument in seconds not in ticks.  So move around some mul/div by
	hz ops to get this right.

2000-08-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c: Use new table definition mechanism.

2000-07-27  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/lib/dhcp_prot.c (do_dhcp): Use xmit->bp_htype =
	HTYPE_ETHERNET rather than ifr.ifr_hwaddr.sa_family; sa_family is
	in a different namespace, despite appearances.

	* src/lib/bootp_support.c (do_bootp): Use bp_htype =
	HTYPE_ETHERNET rather than ifr.ifr_hwaddr.sa_family; sa_family is
	in a different namespace, despite appearances.

2000-07-27  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Require the C library STDIO package to be present
	if there is more than one loopback interface. This is because it
	needs sprintf() to form the interface names.

	* src/sys/net/if_loop.c (loopattach): 
	Only use sprintf() to form the loopback interface names when there
	is more than one. The CDL ensures that this will work.

	* src/lib/network_support.c:
	Added diag_printf() version of perror() for when STDIO package is
	absent.
	Only use sprintf() to form the loopback interface names when there
	is more than one. The CDL ensures that this will work.

	* tests/multi_lo_select.c:
	* tests/ping_lo_test.c:
	* tests/tcp_lo_test.c:
	Removed dependence on C library by adding a substitute perror()
	based on diag_printf() that is enabled when the STDIO package is
	absent.
	
2000-07-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>
 
	* src/lib/dhcp_prot.c (do_dhcp): Set the broadcast flag where
	necessary, and the client address too.  This makes it talk to a
	greater range of servers OK.
 
2000-07-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/multi_lo_select.c: Changed definition of NLISTENERS to
	work correctly with FILEIO package.

	* src/sys/net/if_loop.c (loopattach): Changed initialization of
	if_xname to "lo0".

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_net_init): Removed redundant code to
	initialize loop-back interface.

2000-07-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/lib/getserv.c: Add a list terminator record with NULLs in it
	so that the search finishes (without throwing asserts about bad
	strings).

2000-07-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sys/net/if_bridge.c: Move the include of stdio.h lower,
	apparently it confuses local x86 compilers if their host tree is
	malformed.  Or something.

2000-07-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Add a lot of description about the way the various
	fields are used in interface initialization: specifically that
	"server" so-called is just "someone to talk to" in the absence of
	bootp - and our tests depend on it!

	* src/lib/bootp_support.c (init_net): Only set up a route if the
	route address is nonzero - or all manner of confusion occurs with
	multiple interfaces and route that sends to 0.0.0.0...
	For setting up the default route, use
	      (SIOCADDRT, 0, 0, TAG_GATEWAY)
	rather than the bogus
	      (SIOCADDRT, yiaddr & netmask, netmask, TAG_GATEWAY)
	that we did before.

	* tests/ftp_test.c (ftp_test): Try it with eth1 if available also.

	* tests/ping_test.c (ping_host): If a ping fails, reset the packet
	size to small just in case the huge packet size is what's causing
	confusion - helps it as a debug tool.

	* tests/dhcp_test.c (net_test): It didn't compile if DHCP is
	disabled!  Doh.  Same change as ping_test also.

2000-07-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c (tftpd_read_file): Deal with a) [assumed]
	timeouts on the select, and b) ACKs for old packets.
	[CASE 104052 and CASE 104055]

2000-07-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/lib/select.c (_cyg_select): Return 0 and do not perturb
	errno when the timeout occurs.  That matches the man page!
	[CASE 104054]

2000-07-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/machine/param.h: Be more defensive against warnings from
	external defines such as __linux__/__bsdi__/__FreeBSD__/...
	[CASE 104090]

2000-07-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/multi_lo_select.c: New test program to test for proper
	broadcast behaviour of select() implementation.  Took some
	fiddling to get it to work, but it really did fail before the
	select change below.

	* cdl/net.cdl: Build the new test.

	* src/lib/select.c (_cyg_select): Don't use the CLR flag in the
	flag wait because that gives unicast semantics.  Flags have
	producer-does-all-the-work behaviour, so setting a value then
	clearing it right afterwards does the right thing, with broadcast
	semantics so long as no waiter has set the CLR part.
	[CASE 104058]

2000-07-18  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	All part of the bridge contribution from Andrew Lunn/ASCOM
	(andrew.lunn@ascom.ch).  Bridginess is controlled by NBRIDGE which
	is itself controlled by CDL option CYGPKG_NET_NBRIDGE aka "Number
	of bridge buffers?"

	* include/machine/param.h: Add proper definition of untimeout().

	* include/sys/sockio.h (SIOCBRDGFRL): Add this and the other 2
	bridge ioctl() call definitions. 

	* include/sys/param.h (splhigh): Added.

	* src/ecos/timeout.c (untimeout): Implement this properly, it was
	never used before.

	* src/ecos/support.c: implement cyg_splhigh(), call bridgeintr()
	when it is scheduled and bridgeattach() if configured.

	* tests/bridge.c: New "test" file - implements an ethernet bridge.
	Contributed by Andrew Lunn/ASCOM, from the usual OpenBSD external
	source original.

	* include/net/if_bridge.h: New file, contributed by Andrew Lunn/
	ASCOM, from OpenBSD original.  (Actually did exist in eCos source
	tree but was not released)

	* src/sys/net/if_bridge.c: New file, contributed by Andrew Lunn/
	ASCOM, from OpenBSD original.

	* cdl/net.cdl: Build the new files.

2000-07-18  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/tftp_client.c (tftp_get): Fix edge condition when 
	penultimate block is full and end of file which implies that
	the last block has zero data bytes.

2000-07-18  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/lib/dhcp_prot.c: Ignore NAK messages from the wrong server -
	we get these because the REQUEST for our chosen IP is broadcast,
	so other servers think we've asked to use the wrong IP.

2000-07-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/bootp.h: export init_loopback_interface();

2000-07-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Add option controlling whether to have a separate
	DHCP lease management thread, and what its parameter is to be -
	which controls whether it loops or quits if a lease fails.

	* src/lib/dhcp_support.c (dhcp_start_dhcp_mgt_thread): Provide the
	DHCP management thread function and code to instantiate and start
	the thread if so configured.

	* src/lib/network_support.c (init_all_network_interfaces): Call
	the function that starts the DHCP management thread function.

	* include/dhcp.h: Declare the DHCP management thread function &c
	if so configured.

	* tests/dhcp_test.c (net_test): Only poll for need to rebind DHCP
	leases if there is no service thread to do the same.

2000-07-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/bootp.h (build_bootp_record): Export this, no harm in
	it, and some folk want to use this rather than configured
	initialization or bootp/dhcp.
	Also commented the other APIs somewhat better.

	* src/lib/network_support.c (build_bootp_record): Unconditionally
	provide this; selective linking will look after it if unused.

2000-07-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/lib/network_support.c (build_bootp_record): [Static
	configuration of interface parameters] Add the gateway into the
	options section with TAG_GATEWAY so that init_net() will pick it
	up and set up a route accordingly.

2000-07-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/dhcp_test.c:
	* tests/flood.c:
	* tests/ftp_test.c:
	* tests/nc_test_master.c:
	* tests/nc_test_slave.c:
	* tests/ping_lo_test.c:
	* tests/ping_test.c:
	* tests/server_test.c:
	* tests/set_mac_address.c:
	* tests/tcp_echo.c:
	* tests/tftp_client_test.c:
	* tests/tftp_server_test.c:
	Up the stack size to cope with full DHCP initialization in
	init_all_network_interfaces().
	
2000-07-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Add DHCP enable and interface-specific controls.

	* include/dhcp.h: New file: describe the DHCP APIs and behaviour,
	as well as some internal APIs that are also available.

	* src/lib/dhcp_support.c: New file: the surrounding management
	routines, a bit like network_support.c, which know about multiple
	interfaces and so on.

	* src/lib/dhcp_prot.c: New file: the interface-independent DHCP
	protocol machine, which is called from dhcp_support.c routines and
	init_all_network_interfaces() in network_support.c

	* include/bootp.h (struct bootp): Make the packet bigger if DHCP
	so that a mininal DHCP packet will fit.

	* src/lib/bootp_support.c (do_bootp): If no reply, fail gracefully
	and tidy up so that other interfaces can be upbrung.
	(show_bootp): Tell us a lot more about DHCP-specific info in the
	packet structure.
	(get_bootp_option): be aware of DHCP extensions to re-use file and
	sname fields for options.

	* src/lib/network_support.c (init_all_network_interfaces): Call
	do_dhcp() rather than do_bootp() if so configured, and initialize
	the per-interface DHCP state variables accordingly.

	* tests/dhcp_test.c (net_test): New test file that diddles the
	DHCP machine while doing a ping test.

2000-07-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/netdev.h: Add single-inclusion fences.

	* include/sys/param.h: Add traced versions of splx() routines,
	selectable by a configuration option.

	* src/ecos/support.c: Rework splx() emulation routines to
	be more robust and realtime friendly.

	* src/lib/network_support.c (init_all_network_interfaces): 
	Add minimal support for PCMCIA based devices.

2000-07-04  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/bootp.h: Fix namespace pollution from "#define int32
	int" - it fights against application code too much.

2000-07-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Package requires CYGPKG_MEMALLOC

2000-06-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/ping_test.c (net_test): Added use of the
	CYGPKG_NET_TESTS_USE_RT_TEST_HARNESS stuff now that the test
	passes (consequent on the change below); also use larger ping
	packets now that that is working also.

	* tests/tcp_echo.c (echo_test): Added use of the
	CYGPKG_NET_TESTS_USE_RT_TEST_HARNESS stuff now that the test
	passes (consequent on the change below).

2000-06-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_splnet): Use the scheduler lock and a
	mutex instead of disable-interrupts for SPLX type processing.  A
	mutex is used at splsoftnet because that is client threads - we do
	not want them to pre-empt the rest of the app.  This enables the
	real-time response testing for the EBSA285 to succeed (interrupts
	every 1mS, DSRs delayed by at most 2mS).

2000-06-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_net_mbuf_alloc, cyg_kmem_init): Align
	the mbuf pool to MSIZE [128] bytes.  That way dtom() works, nasty
	though it is.  That's needed for ip reassembly in ip_input.c, when
	dealing with large icmp-layer packets eg. ping -s 2000 ...

2000-06-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/lib/libkern/libkern.h: Do not define assert multiple
	times; guarded by __ECOS.

	* include/sys/param.h (MAX,MIN): Only define if undef.

2000-06-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Build the new tests; in fact build them
	unconditionally.

	* src/lib/network_support.c (init_all_network_interfaces):
	Initialize loopback device[s] using init_loopback_interface(),
	providing a sensible default route et al.  Multiple devs: lo1 will
	be 127.0.*1*.1, and so on; class C netmasks will be used.

	init_all_network_interfaces() is also made thread-safe as well as
	idempotent, so other threads (or daemons) can call it to make sure
	the net is up.

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_net_init): Add a call to loopattach() if
	there are indeed loopback dev(s) configured.  This does the
	equivalent of the init of a device from the table, but simpler.

	* tests/udp_lo_test.c (udp_server): New testcase...
	* tests/tcp_lo_select.c (tcp_server): New testcase...
	* tests/tcp_lo_test.c (tcp_client): New testcase...
	* tests/ping_lo_test.c (net_test): New testcase, unconditionally
	built loopback device test.  Will run on platforms with no network
	interfaces.

2000-06-19  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/ecos/support.c:
	* include/netdev.h:
	Converted to use of new table construction mechanism.

2000-06-16  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/bootp.h: Remove RCS id tag
	* include/netinet/ip_auth.h: Ditto
	* include/netinet/ip_fil.h: Ditto
	* include/netinet/ip_fil_compat.h: Ditto
	* include/netinet/ip_frag.h: Ditto
	* include/netinet/ip_nat.h: Ditto
	* include/netinet/ip_proxy.h: Ditto
	* include/netinet/ip_state.h: Ditto

2000-06-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sys/kern/sockio.c: Added cyg_selinit() calls to bad_socket()
	and bsd_accept() functions.

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_tsleep): Changed tests on wakeup from
	semaphore waits to enable return of EINTR results.

2000-06-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sys/net/if_loop.c: Substituted sprintf() for a straight
	strcpy() when initalizing if name. This currently only works for
	one loopback interface. However, there seems little need to have
	more than one.

	* src/sys/kern/sockio.c (bsd_select): Added select support.

	* include/sys/time.h: Moved timeval structure definition to
	isoinfra time.h header since it is needed by the select() API.

	* include/sys/select.h: Added option to use fileio select
	mechanism if it is present.

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_net_init):
	Added code to bring up the loopback interface. This is to help
	with testing on platforms without network hardware.

2000-06-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/netinet/ip_var.h: Export ipforwarding as well as
	ip_defttl for monitoring applications.

2000-06-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/tcp_echo.c: 
	* tests/socket_test.c: 
	* tests/server_test.c: 
	* tests/ping_test.c: 
	* tests/nc_test_master.c: 
	* tests/nc_test_slave.c: 
	* tests/ftp_test.c:
	Removed dependence of these programs on STDIO. For most this
	simply required the use of a diag_printf() based perror() clone is
	CYGPKG_LIBC_STDIO is not defined. For server_test is also required
	the substitution of sprintf() with some more primitive string
	functions.

	* src/sys/netinet/ip_input.c: Rewrote inet_ntoa() to not use
	sprintf(). This was the only place in the TCP/IP stack that was
	dependent on a STDIO function. We really should avoid building
	this kind of casual dependency into the code.

	* src/sys/kern/sockio.c: This new file contain code to support the
	fileio package. So far only a few of these functions have actually
	been tested.

	* include/sys/kernel.h (time): The time variable clashes with the
	C library time() function. To prevent this it is renamed ktime,
	and a #define allows "kernel" code to continue accessing it as
	time.

	* src/ecos/support.c: Added definition for ktime variable, as
	described above. I could not find any definition for struct
	timeval time. I have a nasty suspicion that it was using the
	time() function - let's hope that no code that actually uses this
	has been run.

	* src/lib/bootp_support.c: Another substitution of a diag_printf()
	based perror() clone when STDIO is absent.
	
	* include/sys/bsdtypes.h: This is the original
	include/sys/types.h. Renamed to avoid clashing with <sys/types.h>
	defined by the isoinfra package.

	* include/sys/types.h: Renamed to bsdtypes.h.
	
	* include/machine/limits.h:
	Various changes to make these headers play nicely with those
	defined in isoinfra package.

	* include/network.h: Added include of <pkgconf/system.h>. Fixed
	prototypes of functions here to match POSIX specifications.

	* cdl/net.cdl:
	Split list of files to compile into the common set plus those
	needed when the fileio package is present and those that are
	needed when it is absent.
	Added CDL to export our definitions to <sys/types.h>.
	

2000-05-31  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/lib/network_support.c (init_all_network_interfaces): Make
	this call idempotent - this is useful for reliable initialization
	of dependent subsystems.

	* include/lib/libkern/libkern.h: remove protos of random() and
	srandom() for they are not in fact provided.

	* cdl/net.cdl: Turn off CYGPKG_NET_TESTS_USE_RT_TEST_HARNESS by
	default - since not all tests currently pass. 

2000-05-12  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/net.cdl (CYGPKG_NET_TFTPD_THREAD_PRIORITY): New option,
	control the TFTPD thread priority.  These options are *all*
	CYGPKG_NET.  Yuk, sort 'em out later.

	* tests/tftp_server_test.c (tftp_test): Added use of the
	CYGPKG_NET_TESTS_USE_RT_TEST_HARNESS stuff, same as for the flood
	ping test.  This one passes (with the next change), so committed.

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c (tftpd_server): Cancelled some of the
	printouts as connections come and go *iff* the tests are set up to
	use the realtime-ness test harness.  This needs generalizing into
	proper control of the network's chattiness overall.
	(tftpd_start): Also added configury of the TFTPD thread priority.

2000-05-12  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Add flood test below.  Also add option
	CYGPKG_NET_TESTS_USE_RT_TEST_HARNESS to decide whether to
	"Use real-time response test harness (if available)".
	Consequently moved the test build stuff forward out of the build
	flags area.

	* tests/flood.c (net_test): New file; performs a flood-ping (well,
	as fast as we can go) of the server(s) on the two interfaces.
	Also uses the real-time interrupt response verification stuff from
	the EBSA285 driver component.

2000-05-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Add new utility (and harmless-by-default test)
	tests/set_mac_address.  You have to edit it to get anything
	damaging to happen.

	* tests/set_mac_address.c: New file added.  It uses SIOCSIFHWADDR
	to set the MAC address of any interfaces it has been told to.

2000-05-08  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/machine/cpu.h: 
	* include/machine/cdefs.h: Add copyright boilerplate.

2000-05-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/arpa/tftp.h: Aargh.  Turns out that removing the align
	driective and retaining only the packed directive makes the
	original version work.  So, reverted.  Apologies for the wasted
	time.

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c (tftpd_read_file): Coupla warnings
	reduced, and reverted to match original tftp.h

	* src/lib/tftp_dummy_file.c (dummy_open): Removed use of
	undeclared malloc().

2000-05-04  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/tftp_server.c: 
	* src/lib/tftp_client.c: Adjust for changes in header structure.

	* include/arpa/tftp.h: Continuing problems with alignment on ARM.  
	Recourse is very bastardized structure, but it _does_ work.

2000-05-04  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/tftp_client_test.c (tftp_test): Print out a coupla more
	things and test both interfaces if they exist - which does the
	same thing twice if the same server bootp'd both.  Changed the
	filenames to something more obvious.

	* cdl/net.cdl (CYGPKG_NET_TESTS): Build the tftp tests
	tests/tftp_client_test tests/tftp_server_test

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_kmem_print_stats): New function; prints
	info about memory usage for some tests to come.

2000-05-04  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/arpa/tftp.h: Force packed alignment - required on some
	architectures.

2000-05-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/tftp_dummy_file.c: Adding very simple routines - just
	enough to test TFTP server.  This support will come from elsewhere
	in actual application environments (e.g. a real file system).

	* tests/tftp_server_test.c: 
	* src/lib/tftp_server.c: 
	* include/tftp_support.h: Flesh out TFTP server support.

2000-04-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/tcp_echo.c (calibrate_load): Import better background
	thread loading algorithm with bugfix; if the initial HIGH limit
	was not large enough, it never got loaded enough.

	* tests/nc_test_slave.c (calibrate_load): Import the fixed version
	from above back in here.

2000-04-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_tsleep): Use 'cyg_scheduler_safe_lock()' so
	this function can be called with the scheduler locked.

	* src/sys/kern/uipc_socket2.c: 
	* include/sys/socketvar.h: Update sblock()/sbunlock() to be eCos safe.

2000-04-12  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/tcp_echo.c: Include <lib/libkern/libkern.h> so that it
	links - otherwise max() is not around.

2000-04-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/lib/libkern/libkern.h: 
	* include/network.h (NO_LIBKERN_INLINE): Disable kernel inline
	functions.

2000-04-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/getserv.c: Add TFTP protocol.

	* cdl/net.cdl: Add TFTP library functions.
	
	* include/tftp_support.h: 
	* src/lib/tftp_dummy_file.c: 
	* src/lib/tftp_server.c: 
	* src/lib/tftp_client.c: New file(s).  Basic TFTP support functions.

2000-04-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/tcp_echo.c (echo_test): 
	* tests/tcp_source.c: 
	* tests/tcp_sink.c: 
	Merge in changes from Grant Edwards <grante@visi.com> presented on
	ecos-discuss "Mon, 10 Apr 2000 11:01:54 -0500" - fix some
	warnings, and use ntohl() on the control data that travels netly
	so that the host tools will work on otherendian machines.

2000-04-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* tests/nc_test_slave.c: Update background thread loading
	calibration to use a binary search (better) algorithm.

2000-03-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/ftp_test.c (cyg_test_exit): 
	* tests/mbuf_test.c (cyg_start): 
	* tests/nc_test_master.c (cyg_test_exit): 
	* tests/nc_test_slave.c (show_net_times): 
	* tests/ping_test.c (cyg_test_exit): 
	* tests/server_test.c (cyg_test_exit): 
	* tests/socket_test.c (cyg_test_exit): 
	* tests/tcp_echo.c (cyg_test_exit): 
	Some eCos infrastructure changes caused, in some configurations,
	cyg_test_exit() from the infrastructure to be brought in (in
	tcdiag.o) even when the Test Case system was not explicitly being
	invoked.  That fought with the convenience copy of cyg_test_exit()
	in these tests.  The neatest fix is to use that provided centrally
	where relevent, so that is what this change does.

	* tests/tcp_echo.c: Also now use granularity of 5% by default,
	calibrate the load at 50%, and check and report the load that was
	actually achieved after the test.

2000-03-29  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* doc/ecos_tcpip.html:

	Remove error-prone cross-reference to another eCos package.

	* doc/index.html:

	Synchronize index page title with web site.

2000-03-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/lib/bootp_support.c (init_net): Need to start interface,
	especially for manual/static IP configurations.

	* tests/nc_test_slave.c (calibrate_load): Better calibration for
	slower targets.

2000-03-18  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/kern/sys_socket.c: 
	* src/sys/kern/sys_generic.c: 
	* include/sys/sockio.h: Add FIONBIO, FIOASYNC, FIONREAD functions.

	* include/machine/types.h: Make definitions safe for use with libc.

2000-03-08  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c: Remove some debug messages.
	Update timed sleep functions (tsleep) to use scheduler lock
	instead of brute-force interrupt locks.

2000-03-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/tcp_echo.c (echo_test): Also enable, log and print out the
	idle-thread activity during the test - this reassures us that
	there is no [significant] spare time being wasted idling during
	the test.  This change has no effect on the results at all.

2000-03-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/tcp_echo.c (calibrate_load): Improve the accuracy of the
	calibration with some post-scaling.  Change load to an array
	accessor instead of register-based floating point - this is less
	load, so more loops are needed, so the initial load level is upped
	also.  More loops means better accuracy anyway, a good thing.

2000-03-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/tcp_source.c (show_results): Print results in Mbit/S also.
	(source_test): Warnings reduction; add some casts to sending and
	receiving the control packets.
	(NUM_BUF): becomes 1024; send more data to get thro'put result.

	* tests/tcp_sink.c (show_results): Print results in Mbit/S also.
	(sink_test): Warnings reduction; add some casts to sending and
	receiving the control packets.

	* tests/nc_test_master.c (show_results): Reinstate tot_bytes
	variable for host testing tool version.  Print results in Mbit/S
	also.

	* tests/nc_test_slave.c (net_test): Comment out starting multiple
	threads; they fight over a wide-open socket.  One thread is
	enough.

2000-03-06  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/netdev.h: Update structure for improved API description.

2000-03-05  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	set hardware (MAC) address via ioctl.

2000-02-28  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/net.cdl:

	Reparent cdl_interface CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH0_SETUP under
	cdl_component CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH0_SETUP_OPTIONS to
	avoid a spurious conflict report when the latter is
	inactive.

2000-02-25  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/net.cdl:

	Reparent cdl_interface CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH1_SETUP under
	cdl_component CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH1_SETUP_OPTIONS to
	avoid a spurious conflict report when the latter is

2000-02-17  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/ping_test.c: Fix typo in startup message.

	* src/sys/net/route.c (route_reinit): New function - only here
	until BOOTP problems can be found/fixed.

	* src/lib/bootp_support.c (do_bootp): Force any existing routes
	to be reset since this causes a problem if BOOTP has been previously
	run.  Also, the BOOTP request must be zeroed or the server will
	get confused.

	* src/lib/network_support.c (init_all_network_interfaces): 
	Rearrange initialization so that all BOOTP activity takes place
	before any permanent setups are in place.

2000-02-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sys/net/route.c (rtioctl): Add support for deleting routes.

	* src/lib/network_support.c (init_all_network_interfaces): 
	Support predefined IP configurations, as well as BOOTP.

	* tests/ping_test.c: Renamed from 'bootp_test.c'

2000-02-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/lib/select.c: Add 'cyg_select_with_abort()' interface which
	will allow 'select()' function to be abnormally terminated.  Add
	new function 'cyg_select_abort()' which does this.

2000-02-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Fix typo; cdl_interface CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH1 was
	missing, so EBSA build was conflictual.

2000-02-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/bootp_test.c:

	* include/network.h: New file(s).

	* cdl/net.cdl: New CDL to support multiple interfaces and their
	configuration.  (Not complete yet).

2000-02-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/lib/select.c (select): Add a way to abort selects (EINTR).

2000-02-10  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/nc_test_slave.c (calibrate_load): Slightly different algorithm,
	which should work better on all platforms.

2000-02-09  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/net.cdl: Add CYGPKG_NET_THREAD_PRIORITY to allow user more
	control over how networking [anonymous] threads behave.

	* tests/nc_test_framework.h: 
	* tests/nc_test_slave.c: 
	* tests/nc_test_master.c: Support test mode with target CPU under
	various loads.

2000-02-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/ecos/support.c (bcmp): Fix bug.  Missing pointer increments
	meant that the zeroth byte only was compared.  Caused stack to
	reject ARP packets - depending on MAC address order for particular
	platform.

2000-02-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/bootp_test.c:
	* tests/ftp_test.c:
	* tests/nc_test_master.c:
	* tests/server_test.c:
	* tests/socket_test.c:
	Change stacksize of test thread to TYPICAL not MINIMAL - some
	drivers eat more stack than others.  Generally:
	-#define STACK_SIZE CYGNUM_HAL_STACK_SIZE_MINIMUM
	+#define STACK_SIZE CYGNUM_HAL_STACK_SIZE_TYPICAL

2000-02-08  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>
