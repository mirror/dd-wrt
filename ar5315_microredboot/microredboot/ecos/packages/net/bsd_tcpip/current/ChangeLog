2004-08-18  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/ecos/support.c (show_net_times): Removed stats_in_cksum.
	It does not exist in the FreeBSD stack. Pointed out by
	Philip Keller.
	
2004-08-17  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/sys/kern/sockio.c (bsd_bind): Pass a copy of the sa into
	bind so that the "kernel" code does not modify the "user" codes
	version of the socket address.

2004-07-15 Oyvind Harboe <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>	
	
	*cdl/freebsd_net.cdl:
	*src/ecos/support.c: made memory pools default to current size, 
	but separately controllable from the cdl file. This is useful for 
	systems with tight memory budgets.
	
2004-06-01  Sandeep Kumar  <sandeep@codito.com>

	* tests/sysctl1.c: Call CYG_TEST_EXIT at the end of the test.

2004-05-25  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/sys/netinet/if_ether.c: Clean up some log messages - remove
	extraneous ":" which caused incorrect printouts.

2004-04-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/ecos/timeout.c (callout_reset): Clarify assert message on
	expiry date from ages ago and also add comment explaining further.

2004-03-30  Horst Kronstorfer  <horst.kronstorfer@frequentis.com>
 
        * src/sys/kern/uipc_mbuf.c
        * src/ecos/support.c
        * include/sys/mbuf.h: Avoid blocking alloc from (empty) mbuf pool.
        Freed mbufs are never returned to the pool, but to the mbuf
        "free list". This can cause a deadlock situation.
        Duplicated incrementing of mbuf statistics removed.
 
2004-03-27  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/ecos/support.c (_dumpentry): Don't skip routes which don't
	have a netmask. These are seem to be valid host routes.

2004-02-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* doc/freebsd.sgml: Import text from openbsd doc about use of __ECOS
	<network.h>, etc.

2004-01-17  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/sys/kern/sockio.c (bsd_connect): Set the sa_len field in
	the sockaddr structure. Real FreeBSD does this.

2003-12-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@calivar.com>

	* include/sys/param.h: Restored MD5 function mappings. These were
	accidentally removed earlier.

2003-12-16  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* cdl/freebsd_net.cdl: Increase default memory pool size to
	include at least enough space to allocate PCBs and SOCKETs.
	Without this, if the number of open files was raised, the
	memory pool was inadequate.

2003-12-10  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* include/netinet/in.h: Prototype for inet_ntoa_r()

2003-11-22  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	Added back the original KAME FreeBSD IPSEC files.  
	* cdl/freebsd_net.cdl: CDl to control the compilation of IPSEC 
	* include/sys/malloc.h: New memory type needed by IPSEC 
	* include/sys/param.h: Name munging for IPSEC symbols 
	* src/ecos/support.c: read_random_unlimited() should return the
	number of random bytes in the buffer.
	* src/sys/kern/kern_sysctl.c: Added missing copyright header.
	* src/sys/netinet/ip_output.c: Removed user() checks in IPSEC code.
	* src/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c: Compiler warning fixes.

2003-11-08  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/sys/kern/kern_sysctl.c (sysctl): Update the oldlen value at
	the end of the sysctl call.

2003-10-28  Matt Jerdonek  <maj1224@yahoo.com>

	* src/sys/netinet/tcp_output.c (tcp_setpersist): Use variable
	tcp_rexmit_shift_max instead of TCP_MAXRXTSHIFT
	* src/sys/netinet/tcp_subr.c (tcp_newtcpcb): Add FreeBSD
	changes to control minimum retransmit time
	* src/sys/netinet/tcp_timer.c : Use variable tcp_rexmit_shift_max
	instead of TCP_MAXRXTSHIFT.  Also add FreeBSD changes to control
	minimum retransmit time
	* include/netinet/tcp_timer.h : Add external declarations to 
	support above.
	
2003-10-15  Roland Cassebohm  <roland.cassebohm@visionsystems.de>

	* src/sys/net/if.c (ifinit): Change printf(...) to log(LOG_INIT,...) to
        make it possible to disable output while initialization.
 
2003-09-17  Reinhard Jessich  <Reinhard.Jessich@frequentis.com>

	* src/sys/kern/uipc_mbuf.c: Now using flags (how) argument in call to
	cyg_net_mbuf_alloc, to avoid a (blocking) call to alloc method of mempool 
	during interrupts. This problem occurred under heavy IP traffic in case the 
	mempool became empty (alloc blocked).
	* src/sys/net/if_ethersubr.c: Avoid dereferencing NULL pointer in case of
	failing m_copy. Note that this problem was (at least sometimes) hidden 
	due to the bug in uipc_mbuf.c (described above).

2003-09-08  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/ecos/support.c (read_random): New function which is needed
	when CYGSEM_NET_RANDOMID is enabled.
	* include/sys/param.h: Prototype for new function.

2003-07-25  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/sys/param.h: Fixed some compiler warnings.
	* src/sys/netinet6/in6_ifattach.c: More fixes.
	* src/sys/netinet6/in6.c: And some more.
	* src/sys/netinet6/in6_pcb.c: YACW.	
	* include/netinet6/ip6protosw.h: Maybe the last one?
	* include/netinet6/ip6protosw.h: Nope
	* include/sys/param.h:
	* sys/kern/uipc_socket.c: More warnings
	* src/sys/netinet6/in6_pcb.c: rename errno to _errno to avoid conflict.
	* src/sys/netinet6/in6_ifattach.c: Prototype for _show_ifp().
	* src/sys/netinet6/in6.c: Prototype for _show_ifp().

2003-07-28  Jay Foster  <jay@systech.com>

	* src/sys/kern/sockio.c:
	Fixed memory leak in accept() call.

	* include/netinet/in.h:
	* src/sys/kern/uipc_accf.c:
	* src/sys/kern/uipc_socket.c:
	* src/sys/net/route.c:
	* src/sys/netinet/ip_icmp.c:
	* src/sys/netinet/ip_input.c:
	Fixed some compiler warnings.

2003-06-12  Motoya Kurotsu  <kurotsu@allied-telesis.co.jp>

        * src/sys/netinet/ip_input.c(ip_reass):
	ip_nfragpackets is increasing by dropping fragments due to mbuf 
	starvation and eventually exceeds ip_maxfragpackets, which 
	results in refusing all fragments later. On the other hand, nipq 
	and maxnipq can be used as a substitute for ip_nfragpackets and 
	ip_maxfragpackets. This fix is the collection of the fixes done 
	at the following revisions of freebsd main branch; 1.221, 1.222, 
	1.223 and 1.229.

2003-06-23  Michael Checky  <Michael_Checky@ThermoKing.com>
 
	* include/netinet/icmp_var.h: Changed icmpstat definition to a
	declaration so stopping ld from generating a multiple symbol
	definition error if combining of common symbols is disabled in the
	toolchain.
	* src/sys/netinet/ip_icmp.c: Added an icmpstat definition.

2003-06-23  Jay Foster  <jay@systech.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c: Increase the stack size for the background
	thread when IPv6 is enabled otherwise the stack overflows.

2003-06-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* src/ecos/synch.c (spl_any): Put call to cyg_mutex_lock() into a
	loop so that releases of the current thread do not get mistaken
	for locks and trigger the asserts.

	* include/sys/malloc.h (M_DEVBUF): Added this definition.

	* include/netinet/in.h: Changed size of sockaddr_in.sin_zero[] to
	24 bytes. This makes a sockaddr_in the same size as a sockaddr.
	Otherwise the definitions of things like ifaliasreq and
	in_aliasreq do not match when they should.

2003-05-12  Motoya Kurotsu  <kurotsu@allied-telesis.co.jp>

	* src/ecos/timeout.c (do_timeout): The head of the linked list of
	timers is timeout, not _timeout.
	* src/ecos/timeout.c (timeout): Linear search the array for empty 
	entries and don't walk it like a linked list, because it is not.
	* src/ecos/timeout.c (untimeout): Linear search is faster since 
	there are many entries in the linked list which are not in the 
	array.

2003-05-12  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/ecos/support.c (_show_ifp): Display the IPv6 flag
	information.

2003-05-04  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c: 
	* cdl/freebsd_net.cdl: Add option to force initialization [debug]
	messages to go to a serial console.  This seems to be necessary
	on some hardware as the init sequence can totally foul up a
	network [debug] connection.

2003-04-28  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_net_malloc): Honour the flag M_ZERO,
	otherwise we end up with junk where we don't want it.

2003-04-11  Michael Checky  <Michael_Checky@Thermoking.com>

	* cdl/freebsd_net.cdl: Deleted the 
	'CYGPKG_NET_FREEBSD_STACK_BUILD_TESTS'
	component because these tests are in the net.cdl component
	'CYGPKG_NET_BUILD_TESTS' and selecting this option in freebsd_net.cdl
	causes build errors.

2003-04-05  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/ecos/support.c (_show_ifp): Now understands IPv6 
	addresses and network masks and added a few more flags
	* src/sys/net/route.c (rt_reinit_rtdelete): Only delete IPv4
	routes so that DHCP and BOOTP works and leave IPv6 routes so IPv6
	also keeps working.

2003-03-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c: Added function cyg_net_show_mbufs() and code
	in cyg_net_mbuf_alloc() to accumulate and optionally display
	information about the current set of mbufs. This is mostly a
	debugging feature and is disabled by default.

	* include/sys/mbuf.h: Added prototype for cyg_net_show_mbufs().

2003-03-14  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/sys/net/if.c (if_attach): Removed printf which causes the
	ethernet device to become corrupt. At this point the app driver
	has started but not completed taking over from the redboot
	driver. It is unsafe for redboot to use the ethernet device.

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/freebsd_net.cdl: Fix doc link.

2003-02-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/freebsd_net.cdl: Remove unused NBPFILTER and BRIDGE CDL options.

2003-02-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* doc/freebsd.sgml: new_net template is now just "net".

2003-02-12  Jani Monoses  <jani@iv.ro>

	* src/sys/kern/sockio.c: bsd_getinfo/bsd_setinfo should have
	void * args. Silences warnings.
	* src/sys/kern/uipc_socket.c (sopoll): Use __FUNCTION__ correctly
	for GCC 3.x.
	* src/sys/net/if_ethersubr.c: Put comments for stuff after endifs
	to silence warnings.
	* src/sys/net/if_loop.c: Ditto.

2003-02-04  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* include/sys/bsdtypes.h: Workaround when building with new
	Linux compatability package (which over-defines some symols
	defined in this module).

2002-12-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c (show_network_tables): New function to
	print information about network tables (interfaces, routing).

2002-11-12  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/ecos/timeout.c (callout_reset): Check for finding the
	correct "delta" was wrong - only used with asserts enabled.

	* include/sys/uio.h: Compatability wrapper to expose 'iovec'
	functions - used by many network programs.

2002-11-04  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/sys/net/if.c (if_attach): Moved check for ifq_maxlen to
	this function since it can't be checked until the device comes
	online, which may not be a sysinit time for PCMCIA devices.

2002-11-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/sys/kern/sockio.c (bsd_getname): Fix error where getsockname()
	was actually performing getpeername().

	* include/sys/uio.h: New file - compatability wrapper.

2002-07-31  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/sys/netinet/in_cksum.c: Fix problem on big endian machines.

2002-07-26  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>
2002-07-26  Ken Cox <jkc@redhat.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c (ovbcopy): ovbcopy() must handle the case 
	where the src and dst regions are overlayed.  memcpy() does not 
	handle this case, but memmove() does.

2002-07-10  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/sys/netinet/udp_usrreq.c: 
	* src/sys/netinet/tcp_subr.c: 
	* src/sys/netinet/in_pcb.c: Rename 'errno' function parameter
	since some compilers have problems with this.

2002-07-08  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* include/sys/param.h: Need <errno.h> which may or may not be
	already present, depending on configuration.

2002-06-20  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* include/sys/param.h (sprintf): Map to diag_sprintf().

2002-06-14  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/ecos/support.c: 
	Fix compile errors when CYGDBG_NET_TIMING_STATS enabled.

2002-06-05  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* include/netinet/in.h: Rename 'ip_opts' field (using the same
	name as the structure is illegal in C++).

2002-05-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/netinet6/in6.h: Fixed warnings.

2002-04-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/netinet6/nd6.c: Make debug (on) default.

	* include/netinet/tcp_debug.h: Fully conditionalize debug facility.

2002-04-17  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/sys/socket.h: Remove definitions only used by sysctl
	since their presence could be misleading.

	* src/ecos/support.c (STACK_SIZE): Remove [debug/testing] bloat.

2002-03-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/machine/types.h: [Placeholder] needed for some compilers.

2002-03-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/netinet/ip_icmp.c: 
	* include/sys/param.h: 
	* include/netinet/icmp_var.h: Export status structure for SNMP.

	* cdl/freebsd_net.cdl: Augment log facilities to what SNMP uses.

2002-03-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/sys/param.h (log): Remove warning.

2002-03-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c (zinit): Add more record keeping (and debug
	prints) for zones.

	* src/ecos/timeout.c (do_timeout): Don't reset ACTIVE when running
	a timeout (since it confuses the TCP timer code).

2002-03-23  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/netinet/in_cksum.c (in_addword): Changed to use uint32 since
	uint64 was wasteful (and failed on some architectures!)

2002-03-20  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/sys/socket.h: Force struct sockaddr to be at least as
	big as IPv4 or IPv6 sockets.  Possibly this could be a little
	cleaner, but at least now it's safe for programs to use sockaddr
	variables in either environment.

2002-03-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com> 

	[Case 107110]

	* src/sys/netinet/in.c (in_control): SIOCSIFADDR switch entry
	moved to before the scan for this same address being in the list
	already, along with Add and Delete (SIOCAIFADDR,SIOCDIFADDR) arms.
	It falls through into the same alloc-if-needed code anyway.
	Thus repeatedly setting the same address does not leak store.

	* src/sys/net/route.c (route_reinit): Rewrite to delete all routes
	individually rather than en-masse (leaking store).
	(rt_reinit_rtdelete): New function; callback for individual
	deletion.
	(rtioctl): Do not pass in a "route **" to return a pointer to the
	route removed or added; this results in an extra reference, by the
	returned pointer, and so a storeleak.
	(rtrequest): RTM_DELETE arm: do not free a gateway route if the
	gateway pointer is the same as the route itself - it gets freed
	*again* at the end of the routine if you do.  Just dec the refcnt.

2002-03-08  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/net/if_loop.c (loioctl): Force IFF_LOOPBACK setting.

	* src/sys/kern/uipc_mbuf.c: Remove some warnings [from munging].

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_net_init): Identify init messages.

	* include/sys/param.h (nstab,nstab_end): These are not defined
	within the network package and thus should not be munged.

	* include/net/if.h: Add "IFF_LOOPBACK" to set of flags which
	cannot be changed outside the kernel.  Note: this is a change
	from the "normal" BSD code.  It was done to keep old code
	working, but it may break some new code.

2002-03-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/kern/uipc_mbuf.c: Work over for the namespace changes.

	* include/sys/param.h: Complete namespace munging; privatize
	all kernel symbols via "cyg_" prefix.

2002-02-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/freebsd_net.cdl: Position this package below CYGPKG_NET
	ie. the common networking package.  Only affects the view in the
	GUI CT, no big deal.
