<TITLE>TCP/IP Stack Support for eCos</TITLE>
<PARTINTRO>
<PARA>
The Common Networking for <productname>eCos</productname> package
provides support for a complete TCP/IP networking stack.
The design allows for the actual stack to be modular and at the
current time two different implementations, one based on OpenBSD
from 2000 and a new version based on FreeBSD, are available.
The particulars of each stack implementation are presented in
separate sections following this top-level discussion.
</PARA>
</PARTINTRO>
<CHAPTER id="net-common-ethernet-driver-design">
<TITLE>Ethernet Driver Design</TITLE>
<PARA>Currently, the networking stack only supports ethernet based
networking. </PARA>
<PARA>The network drivers use a two-layer design.  One layer is
hardware independent and contains all the stack specific code. 
The other layer is platform dependent and communicates with the
hardware independent layer via a very simple API.  In this way,
hardware device drivers can actually be used with other stacks,
if the same API can be provided by that stack.  We designed the
drivers this way to encourage the development of other stacks in
eCos while allowing re-use of the actual hardware specific code. </PARA>
<PARA>More comprehensive documentation of the ethernet device driver and
the associated API can be found in the generic ethernet device driver
documentation
<xref linkend="io-eth-drv-generic">
The driver and API is the same as the minimal debug stack used by
the RedBoot application. See the RedBoot documentation
for further
information.</PARA>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER id="net-common-sample-code">
<TITLE>Sample Code</TITLE>
<PARA>Many examples using the networking support are provided. 
These are arranged as eCos test programs, primarily for use in verifying
the package, but they can also serve as useful frameworks for program
design.  We have taken a
<acronym>KISS</acronym>
approach to building programs which
use the network.  A single include file
&lt;<FILENAME>network.h</FILENAME>&gt; is
all that is required to access the stack.  A complete, annotated
test program can be found at
<FILENAME>net/common/<REPLACEABLE>VERSION</REPLACEABLE>/tests/ftp_test.c</FILENAME>,
with its associated files.     </PARA>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER id="net-common-configuring-ip-addresses">
<TITLE>Configuring IP Addresses</TITLE>
<PARA>Each interface (&ldquo;eth0&rdquo; and &ldquo;eth1&rdquo;)
has independent configuration of its setup.  Each can be set up
manually (in which case you must write code to do this), or by using
<acronym>BOOTP/DHCP</acronym>,
or explicitly, with configured values. If additional
interfaces are added, these must be configured manually.</PARA>
<PARA>The configurable values are: </PARA>
<itemizedlist>
<LISTITEM><PARA>IP address</para></listitem>
<LISTITEM><PARA>netmask</para></listitem>
<LISTITEM><PARA>broadcast address</para></listitem>
<LISTITEM><PARA>gateway/router</para></listitem>
<LISTITEM><PARA>server address.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<PARA>Server address is the DHCP server if applicable, but in addition,
many test cases use it as &ldquo;the machine to talk to&rdquo; in
whatever manner the test exercises the protocol stack.</PARA>
<PARA>The initialization is invoked by calling the C routine   
<PROGRAMLISTING>
void <function>init_all_network_interfaces</function>(void);
</PROGRAMLISTING>
</PARA>
<PARA>
Additionally, if the system is configured to support IPv6 then each
interface may have an address assigned which is a composite of a 64 bit
prefix and the 32 bit IPv4 address for that interface.
The prefix is controlled by the CDL setting 
CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH0_IPV6_PREFIX for &ldquo;eth0&rdquo;, etc.
This is a CDL booldata type, allowing this address to be suppressed if
not desired.
</PARA>

<PARA>Alternatively, the system can configure its IPv6 address using
router solicitation. When the CDL option
CYGOPT_NET_IPV6_ROUTING_THREAD is enabled,
<function>init_all_network_interface</function> will start a thread which sends out router solicit messages, process router advertisements and thus configure an IPv6 address to the interface.</PARA>

<PARA>
Refer to the test cases,
<FILENAME>&hellip;/packages/net/common/<REPLACEABLE>VERSION</REPLACEABLE>/tests/ftp_test.c</FILENAME>
for example usage, and the source files in
<FILENAME>&hellip;/packages/net/common/<REPLACEABLE>VERSION</REPLACEABLE>/src/bootp_support.c</FILENAME>
and
<FILENAME>network_support.c</FILENAME>
to see what that call does.</PARA>
<PARA>This assumes that the MAC address (also known as 
<acronym>ESA</acronym> or Ethernet Station Address)
is already defined in the
serial EEPROM or however the particular target implements this;
support for setting the MAC address is hardware dependent.</PARA>
<PARA>DHCP support is active by default, and there are configuration
options to control it.  Firstly, in the top level of the
&ldquo;Networking&rdquo; configuration
tree, &ldquo;Use full DHCP instead of BOOTP&rdquo; enables
DHCP, and it contains an option to have the system provide a thread
to renew DHCP leases and manage lease expiry. Secondly, the individual
interfaces &ldquo;eth0&rdquo; and &ldquo;eth1&rdquo; each
have new options within the &ldquo;Use BOOTP/DHCP to
initialize &lsquo;<EMPHASIS>ethX</EMPHASIS>&rsquo;&rdquo; to
select whether to use DHCP rather than BOOTP.</PARA>
<para>
Note that you are completely at liberty to ignore this startup code and its
configuration in building your application.
<function>init_all_network_interfaces()</function>
is provided for three main purposes:
<itemizedlist>
<LISTITEM><PARA>For use by Red Hat's own test programs.</para></listitem>
<LISTITEM><PARA>As an easy &ldquo;get you going&rdquo; utility for
newcomers to <productname>eCos</productname>.</para></listitem>
<LISTITEM><PARA>As readable example code from which further development
might start.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para><para>
If your application has different requirements for bringing up 
available network interfaces, setting up routes, determining IP addresses
and the like from the defaults that the example code provides, you can
write your own initialization code to use whatever sequence of
<function>ioctl()</function> function
calls carries out the desired setup.  Analogously, in larger systems,
a sequence of &ldquo;ifconfig&rdquo invocations is used; these mostly
map to <function>ioctl()</function> calls to manipulate the state of
the interface in question.

the server in the expectation that there is no machine there.  This
confirms that the successful ping is not a false positive, and tests
the receive timeout.  If there is such a machine, of course the

not previously mentioned by configuration or by bootp. It then does
the same thing on the other interface, eth1.</PARA>

<PARA><command>tcp_echo</command> is one
part of the standard performance test we use.  The other parts are
host programs <LITERAL>tcp_source</LITERAL> and <LITERAL>tcp_sink</LITERAL>.
 To make these (under your <emphasis>HOST</emphasis> system) cd to the tests source directory in
the eCos repository and type &ldquo;<LITERAL>make -f make.host</LITERAL>&rdquo; -
this should build <LITERAL>tcp_source</LITERAL> and <LITERAL>tcp_sink</LITERAL>.</PARA>
<PARA>The host program &ldquo;<LITERAL>tcp_source</LITERAL>&rdquo; sends
data to the target.  On the target, &ldquo;<LITERAL>tcp_echo</LITERAL>&rdquo; sends
it onwards to &ldquo;<LITERAL>tcp_sink</LITERAL>&rdquo; running
on your host.  So the target must receive and send on all the data that <LITERAL>tcp_source</LITERAL> sends
it; the time taken for this is measured and the data rate is calculated.</PARA>
<PARA>To invoke the test, first start <LITERAL>tcp_echo</LITERAL> on
the target board and wait for it to become quiescent - it will report
work to calibrate a CPU load which can be used to simulate real
operating conditions for the stack.</PARA>
<PARA>Then on your host machine, in one terminal window, invoke <LITERAL>tcp_sink</LITERAL> giving
it the IP address (or hostname) of one interface of the target board.
 For example &ldquo;<LITERAL>tcp_sink 10.130.39.66</LITERAL>&rdquo;.
 <LITERAL>tcp_echo</LITERAL> on the target
will print something like &ldquo;<LITERAL>SINK connection
from 10.130.39.13:1143</LITERAL>&rdquo; when <LITERAL>tcp_sink</LITERAL> is
correctly invoked.</PARA>
<PARA>Next, in another host terminal window, invoke <LITERAL>tcp_source</LITERAL>,
giving it the IP address (or hostname) of an interface of the target
board, and optionally a background load to apply to the target while
the test runs.  For example, &ldquo;<LITERAL>tcp_source
194.130.39.66</LITERAL>&rdquo; to run the test with no
additional target CPU load, or &ldquo;<LITERAL>tcp_source
194.130.39.66 85</LITERAL>&rdquo; to load it up to 85% used.
 The target load must be a multiple of 5.  <LITERAL>tcp_echo</LITERAL> on
the target will print something like &ldquo;<LITERAL>SOURCE
connection from 194.130.39.13:1144</LITERAL>&rdquo; when
tcp_source is correctly invoked.</PARA>
<PARA>You can connect tcp_sink to one target interface
and tcp_source to another, or both to the same interface.
 Similarly, you can run <LITERAL>tcp_sink</LITERAL> and <LITERAL>tcp_source</LITERAL> on
the same host machine or different ones.  TCP/IP and ARP
look after them finding one another, as intended.</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING><EMPHASIS>nc_test_master</EMPHASIS> - network characterization master
<EMPHASIS>nc_test_slave</EMPHASIS> - network characterization slave</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>These tests talk to each other to measure network performance.
They can each run on either a test target or a host computer
given some customization to your local environment. As provided, <literal>nc_test_slave</literal> must
run on the test target, and <literal>nc_test_master</literal> must
be run on a host computer, and be given the test target's
IP address or hostname.</PARA>
<PARA>The tests print network performance for various packet sizes
over UDP and TCP, versus various additional CPU loads on the target.</PARA>
<PARA>
The programs <PROGRAMLISTING><EMPHASIS>nc6_test_slave</EMPHASIS>

</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING><EMPHASIS>tftp_client_test</EMPHASIS> - performs a tftp get and put from/to &ldquo;server&rdquo;</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>This is only partially interactive.  You need to set things
up on the &ldquo;server&rdquo; in order for this to work,
and you will need to look at the server afterwards to confirm that all
was well.</PARA>
<PARA>For each interface in turn, this test attempts to read by
tftp from the server, a file called
<filename>tftp_get</filename>
and
prints the status and contents it read (if any).  It then writes
the same data to a file called
<filename>tftp_put</filename>
on
the same server.</PARA>
<PARA>In order for this to succeed, both files must already exist.
 The TFTP protocol does not require that a WRQ request _create_ a
file, just that it can write it.  The TFTP server on Linux certainly
will only allow writes to an existing file, given the appropriate
permission.  Thus, you need to have these files in place, with proper permission,
before running the test.</PARA>
<PARA>The conventional place for the tftp server to operate in LINUX
is /tftpboot/; you will likely need root privileges
to create files there. The data contents of
<filename>tftp_get</filename>
can
be anything you like, but anything very large will waste lots of
time printing it on the test&rsquo;s stdout, and anything above
32kB will cause a buffer overflow and unpredictable failure.</PARA>
<PARA>Creating an empty tftp_put file (eg. by copying /dev/null
to it) is neatest.  So before the test you should have something
like:</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>-rw-rw-rw- 1 root        1076 May  1 11:39 tftp_get
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root        0 May  1 15:52 tftp_put </PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>note that both files have public permissions wide open.  After
running the test,
<filename>tftp_put</filename>
should
be a copy of
<filename>tftp_get</filename>.</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>-rw-rw-rw-  1 root       1076 May  1 11:39 tftp_get
-rw-rw-rw-  1 root       1076 May  1 15:52 tftp_put

</PROGRAMLISTING>

<PARA>If the configuration contains IPv6 support, the test program
will also use IPv6. It will attempt to put/get the files listed above
from the address it last received a routers solicit from.</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING><EMPHASIS>tftp_server_test</EMPHASIS> - runs a tftp server for a short while</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>This test is truly interactive, in that you can use a standard
tftp application to get and put files from the server, during the
5 minutes that it runs.  The dummy filesystem which underlies the
server initially contains one file, called &ldquo;uu&rdquo; which contains
part of a familiar text and some padding.  It also accommodates
creation of 3 further files of up to 1Mb in size and names of up
to 256 bytes.  Exceeding these limits will cause a buffer overflow
and unpredictable failure.</PARA>
<PARA>The dummy filesystem is an implementation of the generic API
which allows a true filesystem to be attached to the tftp server
in the network stack.</PARA>
<PARA>We have been testing the tftp server by running the test on
the target board, then using two different host computers connecting
to the different target interfaces, putting a file from each, getting
the &ldquo;uu&rdquo; file, and getting the file from the other computer.
 This verifies that data is preserved during the transfer as well
as interworking with standard tftp applications.</PARA>

of a vector of function pointers:</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>struct tftpd_fileops {
             int (&ast;open)(const char &ast;, int);
             int (&ast;close)(int);
             int (&ast;write)(int, const void &ast;, int);
             int (&ast;read)(int, void &ast;, int);
};</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>These functions have the obvious semantics.  The structure
describing the filesystem is an argument to the <function>tftpd_start</function>:
<PROGRAMLISTING>
int tftp_start(int port,
               struct tftpd_fileops *ops);
</PROGRAMLISTING>
</PARA>
<PARA>The first argument is the port to use for the server. If this
port number is zero, the default TFTP port number will be used. The
return value from <function>tftpd_start</function> is a handle which
can be passed to <function>tftpd_stop</function>. This will kill the
tftpd thread. Note that this is not a clean shutdown. The thread will
simply be killed. <function>tftpd_stop</function> will attempt to
close the sockets the thread was listening on and free some of its
allocated memory. But if the thread was actively transferreing data at
the time <function>tftpd_stop</function> is called, it is quite likely
some memory and a socket will be leaked. Use this function with
caution (or implement a clean shutdown and please contribute the code
back :-).
</PARA>

<PARA>There are two CDL configuration options that control how many
servers on how many different ports tftp can be
started. CYGSEM_NET_TFTPD_MULTITHREADED, when enabled, allows multiple
tftpd threads to operate on the same port number. With only one
thread, while the thread is active transferring data, new requests for
transfers will not be served until the active transfer is
complete. When multiple threads are started on the same port, multiple
transfers can take place simultaneous, up to the number of threads
started. However a semaphore is required to synchronise the
threads. This semaphore is required per port. The CDL option
CYGNUM_NET_TFTPD_MULTITHREADED_PORTS controls how many different port
numbers multithreaded servers can service.
</PARA>
<PARA>If CYGSEM_NET_TFTPD_MULTITHREADED is not enabled, only one
thread may be run per port number. But this removes the need for a
semaphore and so CYGNUM_NET_TFTPD_MULTITHREADED_PORTS is not required
and unlimited number of ports can be used. </PARA>

<PARA>It should be noted that the TFTPD does not perform any form of
file locking. When multiple servers are active, it is assumed the
underlying filesystem will refuse to open the same file multiple
times, operate correctly with simultaneous read/writes to the same
file, or if you are unlucky, corrupt itself beyond all repair.</PARA>
 
<PARA>When IPv6 is enabled the tftpd thread will listen for requests
from both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</PARA>

<PARA>As discussed in the description of the tftp_server_test
above, an example filesystem is provided in
<filename>net/common/<REPLACEABLE>VERSION</REPLACEABLE>/src/tftp_dummy_file.c</filename>
for
use by the tftp server test.  The dummy filesystem is not a supported
part of the network stack, it exists purely for demonstration purposes.</PARA>

<TITLE>DHCP</TITLE>
<PARA>This API publishes a routine to maintain DHCP state, and a
semaphore that is signalled when a lease requires attention: this
is your clue to call the aforementioned routine.</PARA>
<PARA>The intent with this API is that a simple DHCP client thread,
which maintains the state of the interfaces, can go as follows:
(after <function>init_all_network_interfaces()</function> is
called from elsewhere)</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>while ( 1 ) {
        while ( 1 ) {
            cyg_semaphore_wait( &amp;dhcp_needs_attention );
            if ( ! dhcp_bind() ) // a lease expired
                break; // If we need to re-bind
        }
        dhcp_halt(); // tear everything down
        init_all_network_interfaces(); // re-initialize
}</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>and if the application does not want to suffer the overhead
of a separate thread and its stack for this, this functionality
can be placed in the app&rsquo;s server loop in an obvious fashion.
 That is the goal of breaking out these internal elements.  For example,
some server might be arranged to poll DHCP from time to time like
this:</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>while ( 1 ) {
    init_all_network_interfaces();
    open-my-listen-sockets();
    while ( 1 ) {
       serve-one-request();
       // sleeps if no connections, but not forever; 
       // so this loop is polled a few times a minute...
       if ( cyg_semaphore_trywait( &amp;dhcp_needs_attention )) {
             if ( ! dhcp_bind() ) {
                 close-my-listen-sockets();
                 dhcp_halt();
                 break;
             }
       }
    }
}</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>If the configuration option CYGOPT_NET_DHCP_DHCP_THREAD
is defined, then eCos provides a thread as described initially.
Independent of this option, initialization of the interfaces still
occurs in <function>init_all_network_interfaces()</function> and
your startup code can call that.  It will start the DHCP management
thread if configured.  If a lease fails to be renewed, the management
thread will shut down all interfaces and attempt to initialize all
the interfaces again from scratch.  This may cause chaos in the
app, which is why managing the DHCP state in an application aware
thread is actually better, just far less convenient for testing.</PARA>

<PARA>If the configuration option CYGOPT_NET_DHCP_OPTION_HOST_NAME
is defined, then the TAG_HOST_NAME DHCP option will be included
in any DHCP lease requests.  The text for the hostname is set by
calling <function>dhcp_set_hostname()</function>.  Any DHCP lease requests
made prior to calling <function>dhcp_set_hostname()</function> will not
include the TAG_HOST_NAME DHCP option.  The configuration option
CYGNUM_NET_DHCP_OPTION_HOST_NAME_LEN controls the maximum length allowed
for the hostname.  This permits the hostname text to be determined at
run-time.  Setting the hostname to the empty string will have the effect
of disabling the TAG_HOST_NAME DHCP option.</PARA>
<PARA>If the configuration option CYGOPT_NET_DHCP_OPTION_DHCP_CLIENTID_MAC
is defined, then the TAG_DHCP_CLIENTID DHCP option will be included
in any DHCP lease requests.  The client ID used will be the current
MAC address of the network interface.</PARA>

<PARA>The option CYGOPT_NET_DHCP_PARM_REQ_LIST_ADDITIONAL allows
additional DHCP options to be added to the request sent to the DHCP
server. This option should be set to a comma separated list of options.
</PARA>

<PARA> The option CYGOPT_NET_DHCP_PARM_REQ_LIST_REPLACE is similar to
CYGOPT_NET_DHCP_PARM_REQ_LIST_ADDITIONAL but in this case it
completely replaces the default list of options with the configured
set of comma separated options.</para>
