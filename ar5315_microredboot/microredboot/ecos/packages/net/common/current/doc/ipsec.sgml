  <TITLE>IPSEC for eCos</TITLE>
  <PARTINTRO>
    <PARA>
    The FreeBSD network stack which is part of
    <productname>eCos</productname> can be configured to use IPSEC to
    provide more secure communications between Internet hosts. IPSEC
    can be used with both IPv4 and IPv6.
    </PARA>
  </PARTINTRO>
  <CHAPTER id="net-ipsec-common-installation">
    <TITLE>Installation and Configuration</TITLE>
    <PARA>
    Due to the restrictions imposed by various countries on the
    exportation and importation of cryptographic software, it has been
    decided to distribute the crypto parts of FreeBSD IPSEC separately
    from the rest of eCos. Before IPSEC can be enabled the eCos
    package bsd_crypto must be installed. This package can be found on
    the eCosCentric server at
    <ulink url="ftp://ftp.ecoscentric.com:/pub/contrib">
    ftp.ecoscentric.com:/pub/contrib</ulink>. Once the package has been
    downloaded it must be installed using the
    <LITERAL>ecosadmin.tcl</LITERAL> script.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
    When the bsd_crypto package has been installed, the building of
    IPSEC will automatically be enabled when the FreeBSD stack is
    used. It can be disabled using the configuration option
    <LITERAL>CYGPKG_NET_IPSEC</LITERAL>. There are no other
    configuration options for IPSEC as a whole.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
    In order to use IPSEC, connections must be configured. This can be
    performed using <FUNCTION>setsockopt()</FUNCTION> calls. A more
    convenient way is the use the <LITERAL>libipsec</LITERAL> library
    from the <PRODUCTNAME>KAME</PRODUCTNAME> distribution. eCos
    contains a snapshot of this library, which is documented else
    where. The aim is to also port the
    <PRODUCTNAME>racoon</PRODUCTNAME> daemon to eCos in the near
    future.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
    It should be noted that the FreeBSD stack in eCos is quite
    old. IPSEC and IPv6 have continued to develop. It is quite
    possible there could be interoperabilty problems when using the
    IPSEC implementation in eCos with more modern implementations.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
    It should also be noted that IPSEC, libipsec etc are currently
    work in progress items.
