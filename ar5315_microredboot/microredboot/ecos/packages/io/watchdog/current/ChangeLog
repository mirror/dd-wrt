	* src/watchdog.cxx: 
	* include/watchdog.hxx:

2003-04-03  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

	* cdl/watchdog.cdl: Turned 'wallclock' into 'watchdog' in string.

2003-04-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/watchdog.cdl: Watchdog implementation requirement should be
	in package, not interface itself. *Note* must be requires, not
	active_if otherwise turning off the emulated watchdog means you
	can never turn it on again!

2000-05-31  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/watchdog.cxx: fix comment.

	* tests/watchdog2.cxx: 
	* cdl/watchdog.cdl: 
	watchdog2 tests timeout is not too fast (safe for both types of
	watchdog semantics).
	
	* tests/watchdog_reset.cxx: 
	* src/emulate.cxx:
	* include/watchdog.hxx:
	Fixed compile errors.

	* cdl/watchdog.cdl: Only build test if the watchdog does not reset
	the board.
	Added build option for interactive reset test.

	prevent it repeating.

1999-08-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/watchdog.h: Made test for use of a non-emulated
	watchdog more generic for MN10300 targets.

	* src/emulate.cxx: 
	* include/watchdog.hxx (class Cyg_Watchdog):
	Added get_resolution() to return maximum time, in nanoseconds,
	between calls to reset().

	* tests/watchdog.cxx: 
	Modified to use the value returned from get_resolution() to
	control the timing of reset() calls.
	
	* src/mn10300.cxx: 
	Added support for AM33 variant. Since the AM33 can only provide a
	maximum watchdog cycle time of 621ms, this has motiviated the
	addition of the get_resolution() call described above.

1999-07-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mn10300.cxx:

1999-04-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/watchdog.cxx: The 'keep alive' message was interfering
	with the watchdog measurement.  Some rearrangement fixes this.

1999-04-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/watchdog.cxx: 
	Restrict number of loops, and number of seconds per loop when we
	detect we are in a simulator. Do this instead of changing the
	value of one_sec in the simulator, since this invalidates the test
	somewhat.
	Output occasional messages to reassure the user that the test is
	still running.
	Fix for PR 19865
