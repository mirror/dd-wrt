2004-10-13  David Brennan <eCos@brennanhome.com>

	* src/pci.c: Added include of cyg/infra/diag.h to fix compiler
	warning.

2004-10-12  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* cdl/io_pci.cdl (CYGPKG_IO_PCI_CONFIGURE_INTLINE): New option.
	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_translate_interrupt): Don't write INT LINE
	register unless CYGPKG_IO_PCI_CONFIGURE_INTLINE defined.

2004-08-31  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_translate_interrupt): Write vector number into
	INT_LINE register.
	(cyg_pci_get_device_info): Add mechanism for HALs to specify certain
	BARs to be ignored.
	* include/pci_hw.h (CYG_PCI_IGNORE_BAR): New macro.
	* doc/pci.sgml: Add info on HAL_PCI_IGNORE_BAR.

2004-01-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@calivar.com>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_get_device_info): Added fix for devices that
	only implement the bottom 16 bits of an IO BAR. This is allowed by
	the standard but is very rare and mostly present in older devices
	only. Without this cyg_pci_allocate_io_priv() gets confused.

2004-01-09  David Vrabel  <dvrabel@arcom.com>
        
	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_find_device): Remove debug message.

2003-11-27  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_find_device): Removed a debug print which should
	not be there and is causing an warning.

2003-11-18  Manu Sharma  <manu.sharma@ascom.com>

        * src/pci.c : Additional changes in cyg_pci_get_device_info, 
        cyg_pci_set_device_info and cyg_pci_configure_device to be able
        to support non-contiguous BARs.

2003-09-29  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_get_device_info): Removed check for inactive
	BARs since the requirement for the BARs to be contiguous has been
	relaxed in more recent versions of the PCI standard.

2003-08-08  Gary Thomas  <gary@mind.be>

	* include/pci.h: Add CYGARC_PCI_DMA_ADDRESS() macro - used to
	map CPU addresses to ones usable by PCI masters.

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/io_pci.cdl: Fix doc link.

2003-02-21  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_get_device_info): While scanning active
	devices, remember the I/O and memory addresses they use.  This
	allows for new devices to be added which will not conflict.

2003-02-20  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* tests/pcihdr.h: Update to latest published version.

2002-05-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/pci1.c: Fix warning.

	* doc/pci.sgml: Tidy up some typos and PROGRAMLISTING width
	issues.

2002-02-11  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* doc/pci.sgml: Brought docs up to date with current code.

2002-01-31  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_init): Set default memory and io bases here
	as the HAL_PCI_ALLOC_BASE_* macros may not be static values.

2002-01-21  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_get_device_info): Fix setting of upper 32 bits
	for 64-bit BAR.

2001-09-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_find_next): 
	* include/pci.h: Allow platforms to restrict PCI bus/device ranges.

2001-08-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/pci.c: 
	printf() is no longer a part of RedBoot.  Thus all programs
	must use diag_printf() and related functions instead.

2001-02-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/pci1.c (pci_scan): Added a new function to re-scan the
	device list after configuring to let a human confirm that we truly
	are seeing distinct devices - ie. do they retain their distinct
	resource allocations in the BARs?  This was useful to me in
	investigating a recalcitrant target...

2001-02-02  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/pci2.c (pci_test): Removed bogus check for 1MB IO limit.

2001-01-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_get_device_info): Do correct casting of
	header_type. Do not make assumptions about structure layout.

2001-01-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/pci.h: Define new API to perform more generalized matching
	on device properties.

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_find_matching): New API implementation.

2000-12-21  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* include/pci_hw.h: Add platform hook so certain devices
	can be skipped by generic PCI io code. This is a workaround
	for a hw problem where configuration space cycles on some
	devices cause a bus lockup.
	
	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_find_next): Use platform hook to ignore
	certain devices during device search.

2000-12-02  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/pci.c: 
	* cdl/io_pci.cdl: Add CDL to control debug prints.

2000-11-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	scanning the bus, showing vendor and device code for each slot.

2000-11-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_find_device): Don't update 'devid' if no
	suitable devices found.  This allows for simpler rescan for
	multiple device types.

2000-11-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/pci_hw.c: 
	* src/pci.c: Layout changes require <pkgconf/hal.h>

	combined with CYG_PCI_NULL_DEVFN.
	(cyg_pci_configure_device): Return true if device already configured.
	Fixed for devices which use no BARs.
	(cyg_pci_allocate_io_priv): Remove bogus limit check.
	(cyg_pci_configure_bus): New function to recursively configure a
	bus and its subordinate bases.

	* include/pci_cfg.h: Added bridge definitions.
	(CYG_PCI_CFG_BAR_5): Corrected.

	* include/pci.h (CYG_PCI_NULL_DEVFN): Define.
	(cyg_pci_device): Add bridge support. Add num_bars. Add
	declaration for cyg_pci_configure_bus.

	lacking same, also tidied up other typos as noticed en passant.

1999-12-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

1999-09-10  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/io_pci.h: Reparent under CYGPKG_IO - this is used under
	more than one target now and the library itself is generic.
