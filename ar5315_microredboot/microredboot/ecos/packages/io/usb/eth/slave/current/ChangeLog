2003-06-27  Manu Sharma  <manu.sharma@ascom.ch>

	* src/usbsethdrv.c (usbs_ethdrv_ioctl): Return 0 when we handle
	ETH_DRV_GET_IF_STATS* otherwise the caller thinks we don't support
	these ioctl calls.

2003-03-23  Iztok Zupet <iz@vsr.si>

	* doc/usbseth.sgml: Remove .eps and .gif and introduce .png for
	for PDF output.
	* doc/simple.gif, doc/tcpip.gif: Delete.
	* doc/simple.png, doc/tcpip.png: New files to replace GIFs.

2003-04-19  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/usbs_eth.cdl: Add per-package compiler flag support and
	default to -D_KERNEL and -D__ECOS for use with the new network
	stack.

2003-04-17  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* doc/usbseth.sgml: Fix typo reported by Patrick Doyle

2003-02-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* doc/usbseth.sgml: Declare as <part> not <reference> to get
	correct TOC numbering.

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/usbs_eth.cdl: Fix doc link.

	* doc/usbseth.sgml: Comment out DOCTYPE for now to allow building
	with standard doc build.

2002-07-26  David Smith  <dsmith@redhat.com>

	* host/ecos_usbeth.c (ecos_usbeth_probe):
	Two changes to the code that checks to see if this is the correct
	driver for the USB peripheral that was just loaded.  Fixed a bug
	that was comparing the product id of the peripheral to the vendor
	id.  Supports multiple implementations (vendor id/product id sets)
	so that the same driver could be used for several devices.

2001-07-10  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* doc/usbseth.sgml, doc/*.html:
	Document the below changes.

	* cdl/usbs_eth.cdl:
	The USB-ethernet device now registers itself as either eth0 or
	eth1 by default, depending on what else is present in the system.
	Also bootp/dhcp support is prohibited for this network device on
	the ground that it is rather unlikely that a host will provide
	a dhcp service for a network device that does not exist until the
	host-target connection has been fully established.
	

2001-07-02  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* host/ecos_usbeth.c (ecos_usbeth_probe):
	Determine the endpoints to use for transmits and receives
	from the descriptors supplied by the device.

2001-06-28  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* include/usbs_eth.h, src/usbsethdrv.c, src/usbseth.c:
	Align receive boundaries to cacheline boundaries, and
	always transfer a multiple of the cacheline size. This
	avoids problems with some USB device drivers.
	
2001-05-21  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* host/ecos_usbeth.c (ecos_usbeth_start_tx):
	Cope with targets that have problems receiving zero-byte
	packets.

2001-02-02  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* cdl/usbs_eth.cdl:
	Add doc property to point at the HTML

	* doc/usbseth.sgml, doc/*.html:
	Incorporate changes from docs department, regenerate HTML

2001-01-26  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/usbsethdrv.c (usbs_ethdrv_ioctl):
	Change chipset specification to null, since there is no real
	hardware involved, plus SNMP cleanup.

2001-01-22  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* doc/usbseth.sgml, doc/makefile, doc/simple.fig, doc/tcpip.fig:
	Added documentation.

2000-12-15  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/usbsethdrv.c:
	Enable poll functions.

2000-11-29  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* host/ecos_usbeth.c:
	Remove debugging and fix the MTU

	* cdl/usbs_eth.cdl
	* include/usbs_eth.h
	* src/usbseth.c
	* src/usbsethdrv
	Clean-up, adding missing functionality such as SNMP support,
	update to current USB API.

2000-11-24  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* host/ecos_usbeth.c:
	Ignore runt packets, cope with the confusion between
	CRC errors and timeouts.

	* include/usbs_eth.h, src/usbseth.c
	Clean up alignments.

2000-11-22  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>
