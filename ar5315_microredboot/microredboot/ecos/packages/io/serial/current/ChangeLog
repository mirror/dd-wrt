	 * cdl/io_serial.cdl :
	 Invoke tail with stricter syntax that works in latest coreutils. 

2004-01-12  Dan Jakubiec <djakubiec@yahoo.com>

	* src/common/serial.c: serial_write() was returning an incorrect
	result code in non-blocking mode when output was blocked.  The
	previous code would return ENOERR with 0 bytes written.  This
	was fixed to return EAGAIN.

2003-08-18  Jay Foster <jay@systech.com>

	* src/common/serial.c: Fixed bug for XON/XOFF flow control that
	would cause multiple XON (or XOFF) characters to be sent for a
	single flow control state transition.
	Fixed bug in serial_write() that would cause output data to be
	discarded if using polled mode with flow control, and output
	was blocked due to flow control.
	Fixed bug in serial_data_xmt_req() that would not stop sending
	data when output was flow controlled off (hardware flow control).

2003-09-02  Eric Doenges <Eric.Doenges@DynaPel.com>

	* src/common/tty.c: Make tty_select prototype match implementation.
	* src/common/termiostty.c: Make termios_select prototype match 
	implementation.

2003-09-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/common/serial.c: Make serial_select prototype match
	implementation.

2003-06-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* src/common/serial.c: Changed all calls to cyg_drv_cond_signal()
	to cyg_drv_cond_broadcast(). Removed comment asking whether this
	matters: it does.

	* include/serialio.h: Added includes of pkgconf files so that the
	ifdefs in this file work properly.
	
	* include/serial.h: Added include of devtab.h to fix compile
	error.

2003-05-21  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com> 	

	* src/common/serial.c (serial_get_config): Restart receiver 
	after input queue flush if it had been throttled.  Inspired
	by David Marqvar <DAM@tt.dk>

2003-03-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/common/serial.c (serial_get_config): For both INPUT_FLUSH
	and OUTPUT_FLUSH keys, pass down to the hardware driver as well
	to allow it to flush FIFOs.
	Based on patch from Roland Cassebohm.

2003-03-20  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/common/serial.c: Only return -EAGAIN if no data moved.

2003-03-11  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/common/termiostty.c (termios_read): VMIN handling still wasn't
	quite correct.  When VMIN > 0, at least VMIN characters should be
	read.

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/io_serial.cdl: Fix doc link.

2003-02-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

2002-12-10  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/common/tty.c (tty_write): Only return number of characters
	in original string which were written - don't include any CR/LF
	expansion characters.

2002-04-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/io_serial.cdl: Removed termiostty.c build rule.

	* cdl/termios.cdl: Make termiostty.c building depending on actual
	requirements for its content.

2002-02-15  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/flow1.c: Also try DSR/DTR flow control (presently
	unsupported by Linux though).
	* tests/flow2.c: Same.

2002-01-11  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/common/termiostty.c (termios_read): Don't return after VMIN,
	this was a stupid thing to do and decreases performance a lot.

2001-08-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* tests/ser_test_protocol.inl: Change NONE in 'cyg_verbosity_level_t'
	to be _NONE [unused] to avoid name clash with <kernel/kapi.h>.

2000-12-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/common/serial.c: Fix CYGOPT_IO_SERIAL_FLOW_CONTROL_HW ->
	CYGOPT_IO_SERIAL_SUPPORT_LINE_STATUS typo when declaring callbacks
	Thanks to Brian Danilko for reporting.

2000-11-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	option.

2000-11-06  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/common/tty.c (tty_write): Check buffer size appropriately
	since when doing \r\n expansion "size" may have been double
	incremented as a result.
	Thanks to Alex Mathews of Crosstor for the fix.

2000-10-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/common/serial.c: Include cyg/infra/cyg_ass.h for assertion
	support since we have assertions here!

	device driver CDL.

	* cdl/io_serial.cdl: Added comment.

2000-10-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/common/serial.c (serial_rcv_char): Register overruns.
	
	* src/common/serial.c: Made block request functions return cause
	of failure. Necessary for the device driver to be able to
	fall-back to other transfer method efficiently.

2000-09-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/common/serial.c (serial_data_rcv_done,
	serial_data_xmt_done): Buffer pointers updated in _done instead of

	flow control overall default off)

	* tests/flow1.c (cyg_start): Fix N_A_MSG -> NA_MSG typo
	* tests/flow2.c (cyg_start): Ditto

2000-08-03  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/common/serial.c (serial_data_xmt_req): Update cbuf->nb
	(serial_data_rcv_req): Update cbuf->nb

2000-08-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/io_serial.cdl: Add support for line status queries,
	software flow control, hardware flow control and POSIX termios
	* include/serial.h: Likewise. Also change prototype for set_config
	hardware operations to use keys to be more flexible.

	new line status and flow control config key queries
	
	* src/common/haldiag.c (haldiag_set_config): Use keys to be more
	flexible.

	* src/common/serial.c: Many changes to support software/hardware
	flow control (with low and high water points), line status and

2000-06-19  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/serial.h:
	* src/common/serial.c:
	Added nb field to cbuf_t structure. This keeps track of the number of
	bytes currently in the buffer. Without this counter, there is no
	way to distinguish a totally full buffer from one that is totally
	empty, since in both cases put==get.

2000-06-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/serial.h: Added selinfo field to cbuf structure when
	select support is enabled.

	* cdl/io_serial.cdl: Added non-blocking option. Added block
	transfer interface.

2000-04-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/PKGconf.mak: remove; it's obsolete.

2000-04-13  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/common/serial.c (serial_write): Make safer - only call
	'start_xmit' with DSRs disabled.

2000-04-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/io_serial.cdl (CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_DEVICES): New package which
	is a container and control for the real device drivers.

2000-04-11  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/io_serial.cdl: Bad hack to build separate test.
	* tests/serial_echo.c: Added.

2000-04-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ser_.... (driver-specific cdl files):
	Remove all these; they are no longer needed following the change
	below.  They do exist in devs/serial/ARCH/PLATFORM/VERSION/cdl/
	directories various instead.

2000-04-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* ecos.db: Re-organize device packages.  This is a massive change
	involving deleting all the sources for serial and ethernet drivers
	from where they used to live in
	    packages/io/serial/current/src/ARCH/PLATFORM.[ch]
	    packages/net/drivers/eth/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	and reinstating them in
	    packages/devs/serial/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	    packages/devs/eth/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...

	All these new packages are properly defined in ecos.db, and are
	all of type "hardware" so that a "target" can grab them.
	
	This directory layout is descriptive of the devices we have right
	now, arch and platform are separate levels just to make it easier
	to navigate in the filesystem and similar to the HAL structure in
	the filesystem.

	It is *not* prescriptive of future work; for example, the mythical
	common highly-portable 16550 serial driver which works on many
	targets would be called "devs/serial/s16550/current", or a serial
	device for a particular board (cogent springs to mind) that can
	work with different CPUs fitted is "devs/serial/cogent/current".

	Changelogs have been preserved and replicated over all the new
	packages, so that no history is lost.

	The contents of individual source files are unchanged; they build
	in just the same emvironment except for a very few cases where the
	config file name changed in this movement.

	Targets in ecos.db have been redefined to bring in all relevant
	hardware packages including net and serial drivers (but the newly
	included packages are only active if their desired parent is
	available.)
	
	The names of CDL options (and their #defines of course) stay the
	same for the serial drivers, for backward compatibility.

	* templates/*/current.ect: these have had CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL added
	rather than it being in (almost) all target definitions.
	
2000-04-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/common/tty.c (tty_read): Correct handling of modes with newlines

2000-04-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/common/tty.c (tty_read): CRLF conversion should use \r\n not \n\r

	CYG_TTY_IN_FLAGS_CRLF to match

	properly (can't ignore them even with TO bit set).

	* src/arm/cl7211_serial.c (cl7211_serial_rx_DSR): Need to handle all

	value supplied for interrupt priority - it may be unused, but it
	is asserted for range.  Initialize the diagnostic channel if on an
	MBX and if NOT using SMC1 ourselves, to ensure that diag output

1999-08-12  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	Imported following changes from development branch:
	
    1999-08-11  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/serial5.c: Modified config test for boards that need a lower
	speed for this test.

	* tests/ser_test_protocol.inl: Removed 14400 baud tests for all
	MN10300 variants. The MN10300 cannot currently do this speed.

	* src/mn10300/mn10300_serial.c: Tidied up the transmit interrupt
	enable/disable code to be variant specific.

	* include/pkgconf/io_serial.h: Undid Jonathan's change, since the
	same options are used for all MN10300 variants.
	
    1999-08-10  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/io_serial.h:
        Reparent CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_MN10300 from under CYGPKG_HAL_MN10300 to
        CYGPKG_HAL_MN10300_AM32_STDEVAL1 since it's stdeval1 specific

    1999-08-04  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/ser_test_protocol.inl:
	Changed names of MN10300 defines tested. Added AM33 definitions.

	* src/mn10300/mn10300_serial.c:
	Modified driver to work on am33 too. This simply requires some
	alternate definitions of things like register addresses and some
	bits in them plus some extra parameterization of some register
	values.

	* src/PKGconf.mak:
	Added am33 to list of architectures supporting serial lines.
	
1999-07-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/io_serial.h: Update descriptions to be more
 	generic (CL7x11 instead of CL7211).

1999-07-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/io_serial.h: Correct typos in CDL description
	for serial port 2 driver

1999-07-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm/ebsa285_serial.c: New file: device driver for the serial
	device of the Intel StrongARM EBSA-285 evaluation board.

	* include/pkgconf/io_serial.h (CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_ARM_EBSA285):
	Config for it.

	* src/PKGconf.mak (EXTRAS_COMPILE): Compile it.

	* tests/ser_test_protocol.inl (TEST_SER_DEV): Enable testing of it.

1999-07-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/ser_test_protocol.inl (change_config): Changed implementation.

1999-06-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/powerpc/quicc_smc_serial.c (quicc_smc_serial_init): More robust
	initialization, with data cache disabled.  This seems to fix the
	random failures described below.

	* tests/ser_test_protocol.inl: Add configuration for QUICC/MBX860.
	Added some delays in the configuration change code to make QUICC
	happy [didn't help much although the manual says they are required].

	* src/powerpc/quicc_smc_serial.h (UART_BITRATE): Rewrote macro to 
	match what the Linux driver uses - still doesn't work well, though.

	* src/powerpc/quicc_smc_serial.c: Lots of changes trying to get the
	serial driver working and robust.  At this point it works quite well,
	using the default buffer sizes.  Changing from the defaults seem to
	easily break it though, certainly on input.  Also, changing the baud
	rate seems to not work reliably.

	* src/common/serial.c: Add some tracing/debug info to try and debug
	problems with QUICC serial driver.  These are hard disabled with
	"XX_" prepended to "CYGDBG_DIAG_BUF".  Enabling them gives information
	about how/when data are delivered from the serial driver.

	* include/pkgconf/io_serial.h: Adjust limits and defaults on number and
	size of buffers with values that seem to work.

1999-06-21  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sh/sh_sci_serial.c: Rearranged inclusion of .inl file a bit
	to avoid compiler warnings.
