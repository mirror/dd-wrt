	* src/file.cxx: Added a check data ptr in LOCK_FS

2004-10-06  David Brennan  <eCos@brennanhome.com>

	* tests/pselect.c: Added check for POSIX signals while building
	the test case.
	* tests/select.c: Include sys/select.h to prevent a possible warning.
	
2004-10-01  Oyvind Harboe  <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

        * src/select.cxx: place the CYGBLD_ATTRIB_INIT_PRI such that it
	compiles for gcc 3.4.2 which is more picky about its placement.
	
2004-07-23 Oyvind Harboe <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

	* src/select.cxx: now correctly returns from select() on
	e.g. closed file pointers.

2004-04-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests/fileio1.c: include stdio.h for rename() prototype.

2004-04-07  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/fd.cxx: Fix the assert just added. 0 is a valid fd.

2004-03-25  Sebastien Couret  <sebastien.couret@elios-informatique.fr>

	* src/fd.cxx: Added CYG_ASSERT bound checking for file descriptor
	numbers (0<fd<CYGNUM_FILEIO_NFD).

2004-03-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/fio.h: If no POSIX then CYG_FILEIO_DELIVER_SIGNALS
	and CYG_FILEIO_SIGMASK_SET call CYG_UNUSED_PARAM on their
	arguments to silence warnings.
	* src/file.cxx (rename): Use a throw specifier to match
	prototype.

2004-02-16  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/io.cxx (readwritev): For EWOULDBLOCK and EAGAIN return
	the number of bytes written if any have been written.

2004-01-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/select.cxx: No need to make pselect() dependent on
	CYGPKG_POSIX - that would depend on the arguments. Assert instead,
	and more correctly make it contingent on CYGPKG_POSIX_SIGNALS.

	* src/fio.h: Separate out signal functionality into its own separate
	test.

2003-12-21  Sandeep Kumar <sandeep@codito.com>

	* src/dir.cxx (readdir_r): Handle NULL dirp argument and return
	EBADF

2003-12-03  Dan Jakubiec  <djakubiec@yahoo.com>

	* src/select.cxx (pselect): Fixed the pselect() call to correctly
	handle NULL timeout arguments.  The previous implementation would
	cause a random timeout value to be used.

2003-11-28  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@redhat.com>

	* include/fileio.h, include/sockio.h, src/dir.cxx, src/fd.cxx,

2003-10-16  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/socket.cxx (bind): Pass a copy of the socket address so the
	stack can modify it without changing the users copy. Bug found by
	reji@codito.com.

2003-10-06  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/fio.h (CYG_FILEIO_SIGMASK_SET): Fixed a compiler warning
	about an unused variable.

2003-09-22 Eric Doenges <Eric.Doenges@DynaPel.com>
	* src/devfs.cxx: prototype of dev_fo_select now matches
	implementation
	* include/fileio.h: changed definition of cyg_fileop_select to
	return a cyg_bool instead of int to match current implementations
	* src/misc.cxx: changed cyg_fileio_seltrue() to match prototype.

2003-07-11  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/socket.cxx (socket): If there are no network stacks configured
	return EAFNOSUPPORT when opening a socket.

2003-04-11  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/socket.cxx: Give nstab_lock mutex a priority. Also it's
	local, so make static.
	Change nstab and nstab_end to cyg_nstab and cyg_nstab_end for
	cleaner namespace.
	* include/sockio.h: nstab -> cyg_nstab.
	* src/misc.cxx, src/dir.cxx, src/fio.h, src/file.cxx: Change
	fstab, fstab_end, mtab, mtab_end, cdir_dir, cdir_mtab_entry to
	have cyg_ prefix for cleaner namespace.

2003-03-20  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/devfs.cxx: Remove unnecessary checks for -EAGAIN (should
	no longer happen in lower layers).

2003-03-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests/pselect.c (pthread_entry1): Allow for infrequent but
	occasional off by one error due to race condition when
	signalling.

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Add doc link.

2003-02-20  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: identify test binaries, not test sources

2003-01-30  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Added interface CYGINT_IO_FILEIO_FS which any
	FS which FILEIO can use should implement. 

2003-01-23  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/misc.cxx (cyg_mtab_lookup): Return an error if the current
	directory is not known - happens if no file systems are mounted.

2002-11-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/fio.h: Added macros to deal with signal handling. These will
	call into the POSIX package if it is present, but are null if it
	is not.

	* src/select.cxx: Renamed original select() to cyg_pselect() and
	added select() and pselect() routine from POSIX-200X to call
	it. Reorganized code a little and added calls to macros to deal
	with signal delivery and detection.

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: 
	* tests/pselect.c: New test added to verify the signal masking and
	delivery behaviour of pselect().

	* tests/select.c: Fixed up some printfs to make it a little tidier.

2002-11-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/io.cxx: 
	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Add readv()/writev() support.

2002-08-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@calivar.demon.co.uk>

	* src/select.cxx (select): Changed mechanism for calculating
	select timeout to avoid possible race conditions between this code
	and the timer DSR.

2002-05-29  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/fileio1.c: Removed strcat definition. Rely on string.h to
	provide it.

2002-05-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/limits.h (NAME_MAX): Increase default to 64.
	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Set CYGBLD_ISO_NAME_MAX_HEADER.

2002-04-11  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* doc/fileio.sgml: Added a section on writing a new
	filesystem. This probably still needs more work, but it's better
	than nothing.

2002-04-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/devfs.cxx: Changed test for EAGAIN in dev_fo_read() and
	dev_fo_write() to negate value first. 

2002-03-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* doc/fileio.sgml: Added this file to contain documentation on
	this package.

2002-02-04  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* tests/socket.c (main): 
	* tests/select.c (main): sin_len field must be set.

2002-01-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Actually, don't bother to build testfs.c at all.

2002-01-29  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Added CYGPKG_FILEIO_BUILD_TESTS option and made
	building of testfs dependant on it.

2002-01-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/inode.h: New API defining a common generic inode type.
	* src/inocache.cxx: Implement the inode cache functions.
	* cdl/fileio.cdl: (Configurably) build it.

2002-01-23  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@redhat.com>
2002-01-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Remove select compilation and support to new
	CYGFUN_IO_FILEIO_SELECT option conditional on the kernel
	Ditto for DEVS and CYGPKG_IO_FILEIO_DEVFS_SUPPORT.
	Make CYGPKG_IO_FILEIO_SOCKET_SUPPORT also conditional on kernel.
	* src/fio.h: Define FILEIO_MUTEX_LOCK() and FILEIO_MUTEX_UNLOCK()
	so that code doesn't need to care whether the kernel is included or
	not.
	* src/fd.cxx: Conditionalize mutex usage throughout on CYGPKG_KERNEL,
	and FILEIO_MUTEX_LOCK()/UNLOCK().
	* src/file.cxx: Ditto.
	* src/misc.cxx: Ditto.
	(cyg_timestamp): Only use Cyg_Clock implementation if CYGPKG_KERNEL.

2002-01-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/misc.cxx: Initialize fileio_initializer at prio CYG_INIT_IO_FS
	so it happens after the devices it depends on.
	* src/file.cxx (getcwd_lock): Ditto.
	* src/select.cxx (select_mutex): ditto.
	(selwait): ditto.
	* src/fd.cxx (fdlock): ditto

	(readdir_r): Ditto.
	* src/devfs.cxx (dev_stat): Don't use handle for st_dev - it will

2002-01-04  Wade Jensen <Wade_Jensen@inter-tel.com>
2002-01-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

2001-11-02  Felix Wong  <felixwong@i-technologies.cc>
2001-11-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/devfs.cxx (dev_fo_read): Support block devices.
	(dev_fo_write): Ditto.

2001-10-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/fio.h: Make cancellation point dependand on
	CYGINT_ISO_PTHREAD_IMPL from <pkgconf/isoinfra.h> really.

	EAGAIN correctly
	(dev_fo_write): Ditto for writes.

2001-06-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/fio.h (FILEIO_ENTRY): Don't use CYG_MACRO_START/END around
	tracing macros.
	Reported by Richard Panton.

2001-06-11  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/socket.cxx (cyg_sock_unlock): Fix cyg_file_lock->cyg_file_unlock
	thinko.

2001-03-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/file.cxx (open): Check for required/valid open mode.

2001-03-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/misc.cxx (cyg_mtab_lookup): check valid mtab entry
	(umount): ditto.

2001-03-14   Martin van Veen  <martin_van_veen@yahoo.com>

	* tests/socket.c (main):
	Added call to init_all_network_interfaces().

2000-12-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/misc.cxx: Fixed some bugs in initialization of timestamp
	function when Wallclock and POSIX packages are absent.

2000-11-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/io.cxx (readwrite): Ensure we call FILEIO_RETURN_VALUE() to
	get correct cleanup
	(fpathconf): Ditto
	(lseek): Ditto

	* src/file.cxx (open): If applicable, refer to stdin, stdout and stderr
	here to ensure they are pulled in, in case selective linking would
	otherwise eliminate them. This is to ensure they get allocated to
	fd's 0, 1 and 2.

2000-10-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/io.cxx (readwrite): Merged both read() and write() functions
	into this single common routine.  

	* include/fileio.h: Introduced a common typedef for both read and
	write operations.

	* doc/fileio.txt: Added some text about getcwd() and tidied up
	some other parts.

2000-10-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/file.cxx: Added support for getcwd(). There are three
	mechanisms provided here. The first is to use the FS_INFO_GETCWD
	key on the filesystem to use any support it has for this. If that
	fails it falls back on one of the two other mechanisms. If
	CYGPKG_IO_FILEIO_TRACK_CWD is set then the current directory is
	tracked textually in chdir() and the result of that is reported in
	getcwd(). Otherwise an attempt is made to traverse the directory
	tree to its root using ".." entries. This last option is
	complicated and expensive, so the other two mechanisms are to be
	preferred if possible.

	* include/fileio.h: Added FS_INFO_GETCWD getinfo option and a
	matching struct cyg_getcwd_info. These are used to access getcwd()
	support in a filesystem.

	* src/fio.h: Added initial support for POSIX API function entry
	and return. 

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Added CYGPKG_IO_FILEIO_TRACK_CWD option to
	enable current directory tracking.

2000-09-28  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/select.cxx (cyg_selwakeup):
	Removed test for whether the waiting thread is actually waiting
	for this event. This lead to a race condition when the thread is
	still polling other objects but has already checked this
	event. Now all waiting selectors are woken up by each selectable
	event.

2000-09-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/select.cxx: Apply constructor prioritization to mutexes and
	condition variables
	* src/fd.cxx: Ditto

2000-09-11  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/select.c: NA if no POSIX package

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Set CYGBLD_ISO_OPEN_MAX_HEADER to this package's
	limits.h

	future)

2000-09-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/fileio.h:
	Removed spaces from arguments to CYG_HAL_TABLE_ENTRY().

	* include/sockio.h (struct cyg_nstab_entry): Apply CYG_HAL_TABLE_TYPE
	* include/fileio.h (struct cyg_mtab_entry): Ditto
	(FSTAB_ENTRY): Ditto

2000-08-31  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	return case.

2000-08-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* doc/fileio.txt: Add Nick's text description of plug-in filesystems
 	and sockets here for now.

2000-08-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/fileio.h: Added CYG_FAPPEND flag for preservation in
	file object flags.
	Added prototype for cyg_timestamp().

	* src/misc.cxx: Fixed bug in cyg_mtab_lookup() when dealing with
	empty mount table entries.
	Added cyg_timestamp() to provide timestamp support to client
	filesystems.

2000-08-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/misc.cxx: Don't define own strcmp() function (which had a bug
	anyway). Use string.h.
	* cdl/fileio.cdl: requires ISO C string functions

2000-08-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/misc.cxx: Use correct initializer for mtab_extra

	* src/fio.h (FILEIO_RETURN_VOID): Surround in CYG_MACRO_START to
	prevent problems when used with one-line if.
	(FILEIO_RETURN_VALUE): Likewise

	* include/fileio.h: Make getinfo/setinfo take void *bufs, not char *
	for easier casting (and more correct)

	* tests/testfs.c: Likewise

	* src/devfs.cxx: Likewise.
	Also fix bug with Nick's change below that set non-blocking mode
	in all cases.

2000-07-31  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/devfs.cxx (dev_open): Added support for O_NONBLOCK.

2000-07-27  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/select.c: Wrapped include of pkgconf/io_serial.h in
	#ifdef CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL.

2000-07-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/select.c (main): Wrap call to init_all_network_interfaces()
	in #ifdef TEST_NET

2000-07-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/select.c (main): Added call to
	init_all_network_interfaces(). 

2000-07-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/fileio.h:
	* src/file.cxx:
	* src/devfs.cxx:
	* tests/testfs.c:
	Added support for link() API call. This was the only major file
	operation omitted.

2000-07-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/fileio.h: Added some modes for fsync().

	* src/file.cxx: Added access() function.

	* src/io.cxx: Added fdatasync() and isatty().

	* src/devfs.cxx: Added fsync() support.

	* tests/fileio1.c: Added calls to access() to check (non-)existence
	of files where appropriate.

2000-07-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/select.cxx (select): Fixed return value when timing out. Now
	returns zero and no error, it used to return -1 and ETIMEDOUT.

	* src/io.cxx: Fixed fsync() to match standard.

	* src/devfs.cxx:
	Added lseek() support - all devices are always at position
	zero. Added [f]stat() support - currently just fills in the stat
	buffer with some predefined values. When we have more
	sophisticated devices this may need to be improved.

	* tests/testfs.c (testfs_open): Added support for O_TRUNC open
	flag.
	
	* tests/stdio.c: 
	* cdl/fileio.cdl:
	Added stdio.c to test C library IO integration. This does not test
	the C library functionality, just that it works with the fileio
	package in certain limited ways.

2000-06-30  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/misc.cxx: Fixed definition of mtab_extra[] so that it gets
	emitted correctly into the object file.

	* tests/testfs.c:
	Added support for dynamic mount()/umount().
	Added testfs_dump() to report state of filesystem, and to do a
	little consistency checking.

	* tests/fileio1.c: Extended testing to mount() and maximum file
	sizes.

2000-06-28  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Added dev.cxx to compile list. Added support for
	dirent.h implementation.

	* tests/testfs.c: Lots of changes towards a more complete
	implementation.

	* tests/select.c: Changed SHOW_RESULT() message a little. Fixed up
	some warnings when no testing is possible.

	* tests/fileio1.c:
	Largely rewritten to do more complete testing.

2000-06-19  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/select.cxx: Added selwake_count variable to count select
	wakeups. This allows us to avoid sleeping when a selectee calls
	cyg_selwakeup() while we are still scanning the FD sets.

	* include/fileio.h:
	* include/sockio.h: 
	* src/misc.cxx: 
	* src/socket.cxx: 
	Converted tables to new mechanism.

	serial devices. 
	
2000-06-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/fileio.h:
	Added typedef for cyg_selinfo.
	Added umount to fstab entry structure.
	Added mount() and unmount() prototypes.
	Added const in various places.
	Changed some types from CYG_ADDRWORD to their ISO standard
	equivalents.
	Added si_thread field to cyg_selinfo structure, added
	cyg_selinit() prototype.

	* src/socket.cxx: Converted an errant LOCK_NS() into the
	UNLOCK_NS() it should be.

	* src/select.cxx:
	Added cyg_selinit() which must be called by all selectees at
	initialization to prepare a cyg_selinfo structure for use.
	Modified cyg_selwakeup() to minimize the number for actual wakeup
	operations it actually performs.

	* src/misc.cxx:
	Added mtab_extra[] to contain dynamic mount table entries,
	modified startup scan of mtab to cope with this.
	changed matchlen() to cope with "/" mountpoint, this function is
	rapidly ceasing to be the neat bit of code it started out as.
	Added implementations of mount() and umount().

	* src/devfs.cxx: Added dev_umount, various minor tweaks.

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Added CYGNUM_FILEIO_MTAB_EXTRA to define how
	many extra mount table entries should exist for dynamic mounts.
	Added select.c to list of tests.

	* tests/select.c: Added this file to test select() functionality
	on both sockets and (serial) devices.

	* tests/socket.c: Tidied some compilation warnings.

	* src/file.cxx: 
	* src/fd.cxx:

	* src/select.cxx: 
	* src/devfs.cxx: 
	* include/fileio.h:
	* tests/testfs.c: 
	Added select() support.

	* src/socket.cxx: Fixed a resource management bug in accept().

	* tests/socket.c: Extended to test that all API calls work, at
	least minimally, as they should. Still some calls to add here.
	
2000-06-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/socket.c: Simple socket API test program. Needs much more
	work to give full coverage.

	* src/socket.cxx: Filled in some implementations. Changed some
	type specifications.

	* src/select.cxx: Added this file to contain select()
	implementation. At present it does nothing.

	* include/sockio.h:
	Added definition of socklen_t for use when the NET package is
	absent - just so this file compiles.
	Added macro to generate an nstab entry.
	Changed prototypes of socket operation ffunctions to better match
	both API definition and BSD stack implementation.

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Added support for socket API. This is only
	active if the NET package is present.
	Added initial socket API test program.

2000-06-02  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/socket.cxx:
	Added this file to implement socket interface. This is still a
	rough draft that has not yet been tested.

	* src/misc.cxx: 
	* src/io.cxx: 
	* src/fio.h: Various minor changes and bug fixes.

	* src/file.cxx: Various bug fixes. Added pathconf().

	* src/fd.cxx: Various changes and bug fixes, mostly in the
	handling of the locking mechanisms.

	* src/devfs.cxx: Added this filesystem to interface to the device
	IO subsystem. Not yet tested.

	* include/sockio.h: Various minor changes prompted by
	implementation.

	* include/fileio.h:
	Added macros to instantiate filesystem and mount table entries.
	Added mode mask for setting up f_flags.
	Changed file object types, added device type.

	* cdl/fileio.cdl:
	Added some extra files to compile. Some now go in libextras.
	Added table maxima for fstab, mtab and nstab.
	Added tests.

	* tests/fileio1.c: Added this simple test for the fileio
	infrastructure.

	* tests/testfs.c:
	Created this simple ROM filesystem to test out the fileio
	infrastructure. This is not really usable for anything other than
	this, and should not be used in "production" systems. Hence its
	presence in tests rather than src.
	At present this only has support for open(), close(), read(),
	write(), lseek() and unlink(). Other parts will be implemented as
	and when required.

	* src/fio.h: 
	* src/file.cxx: 
	* src/io.cxx: 
	* src/misc.cxx:
	Roughed out most of the file IO infrastructure. While this code
	compiles, none of it has actually been executed yet. A lot of this
	was cut-and-paste-and-edit, so some minor blemishes are to be
	expected.

	* src/fd.cxx: Several modifications in response to implementing
	rest of infrastructure. Added dup() and dup2() API routines.

	* include/fileio.h: Many changes and tidies prompted by
	infrastructure implementation.

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Added "implements" directives for isoinfra
	interfaces. Extended compile to new files.

2000-05-26  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/fileio.h:
	* include/sockio.h:
	* src/fd.cxx:
	* cdl/fileio.cdl: 
	Created these files as a start at defining the file IO package.
	There is still a lot to do here, so expect radical changes to all
	of these files in the near future.
