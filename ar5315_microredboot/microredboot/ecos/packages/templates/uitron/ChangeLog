	* current.ect: Provide default for CYGBLD_ISO_STDIO_FILEOPS_HEADER
	and CYGBLD_ISO_STDIO_FILEPOS_HEADER.

2001-11-27  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	 current.ect: Provide default for CYGBLD_ISO_STRING_BSD_FUNCS_HEADER

2000-11-03  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* current.ect: Add inferred values for CDL that confuses the
	config tool inference engine at present.

2000-09-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* current.ect: Add libc signals package because there's no real reason
	not to.

2000-07-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* current.ect: Update to reflect new libc package layout, isoinfra,
	and addition of CYGPKG_MEMALLOC

2000-04-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* ecos.db: Re-organize device packages.  This is a massive change
	involving deleting all the sources for serial and ethernet drivers
	from where they used to live in
	    packages/io/serial/current/src/ARCH/PLATFORM.[ch]
	    packages/net/drivers/eth/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	and reinstating them in
	    packages/devs/serial/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	    packages/devs/eth/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...

	All these new packages are properly defined in ecos.db, and are
	all of type "hardware" so that a "target" can grab them.
	
	This directory layout is descriptive of the devices we have right
	now, arch and platform are separate levels just to make it easier
	to navigate in the filesystem and similar to the HAL structure in
	the filesystem.

	It is *not* prescriptive of future work; for example, the mythical
	common highly-portable 16550 serial driver which works on many
	targets would be called "devs/serial/s16550/current", or a serial
	device for a particular board (cogent springs to mind) that can
	work with different CPUs fitted is "devs/serial/cogent/current".

	Changelogs have been preserved and replicated over all the new
	packages, so that no history is lost.

	The contents of individual source files are unchanged; they build
	in just the same emvironment except for a very few cases where the
	config file name changed in this movement.

	Targets in ecos.db have been redefined to bring in all relevant
	hardware packages including net and serial drivers (but the newly
	included packages are only active if their desired parent is
	available.)
	
	The names of CDL options (and their #defines of course) stay the
	same for the serial drivers, for backward compatibility.

	* templates/*/current.ect: these have had CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL added
	rather than it being in (almost) all target definitions.

	* current.ect: Wallclock moved.

	* templates/uitron directory created
