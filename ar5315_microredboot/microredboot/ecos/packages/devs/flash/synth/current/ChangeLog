	new prototype.
	
2002-01-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/flash_synth.cdl: Add CYGMEM_FLASH_SYNTH_BASE to allow
	imposition of base address.
	Add CYGSEM_FLASH_SYNTH_FILE_WRITEBACK to allow changes to be
	reflected in the underlying file.
	* src/synth.c (flash_hwr_init): Implement CYGMEM_FLASH_SYNTH_BASE and
	CYGSEM_FLASH_SYNTH_FILE_WRITEBACK using appropriate args to mmap().
	Include <string.h> to avoid warning.

	* src/synth.c (flash_hwr_init): Initialize to 0xff if the file
	needs creating.
	* cdl/flash_synth.cdl: requires errno codes.
