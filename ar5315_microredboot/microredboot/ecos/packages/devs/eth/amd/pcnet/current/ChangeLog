2004-08-12  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	* src/if_pcnet.c: Fix builing with lwip.

2002-06-14  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/if_pcnet.c: 
	Need to include <pkgconf/io_eth_drivers.h> for proper configuration
	of stand-alone (polled) vs. system (interrupt driven) mode.

2002-02-19  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c: Fix a typo. Skip TX handling when there's no
	outstanding TX packets.

2001-12-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c (amd_pcnet_init): Fix warning.
	(pcnet_send): Fix bad debug code.

2001-12-04  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c:
	Added a couple of 100us delays in transmit code. These appear to
	be necessary to meet timing constraints on some platforms. These
	are not a very satisfying fix, but they will have to do for now.
	Also changed all references to diag_printf to db_printf, and added
	a static implementation of db_printf() that will gnerate
	diagnostic output properly on RedBoot.

	* src/amd_pcnet.h: diag_printf -> db_printf
	
2001-10-16  David Howells  <dhowells@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c: don't invert the logic of the auto-negotiation
	completion flag.

2001-10-16  David Howells  <dhowells@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c: check the correct flag to determine end of
	auto-negotiation.
	* src/amd_pcnet.h: ditto	
	
2001-10-15  David Howells  <dhowells@redhat.com>

	* cdl/amd_pcnet_eth_drivers.cdl: added option to force 10Mbps only
	speed negotiation.
	* src/amd_pcnet.h: ditto
	* src/if_pcnet.c: ditto

2001-09-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/amd_pcnet.h: fix warning.

2001-07-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c (amd_pcnet_init): Wait for init table loadup
	completion. Removed ESA hack.

2001-07-25  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c: Be more careful with the use of STOP since it
	clears interrupt request flags. Moved some code from _start to
	_init. Don't double check RX int flag in RxEvent function.
	(amd_pcnet_init): Move ID output below initialization.
	Get rid of the last use of STOP, replace with SUSPEND. Minor
	cleanups.
	(amd_pcnet_init): Fix silly compile error.
	(amd_pcnet_init): Check that the controller actually
	starts. Appears that it needs to be kicked a couple of times under
	certain conditions.

	* src/amd_pcnet.h: Added TFC bits.

2001-07-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c: Mask off RDRA/TDRA pointers. Additional debug
	info. Hack for broken ESA init. Don't clear TX interrupt flag in
	send function (leave it to the event handler).
	(pcnet_stop): Don't reset the controller, just stop it.
	(pcnet_TxEvent): Only ack interrupt once.

	* src/amd_pcnet.h: Added more registers.

2001-07-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c: Make controller recover after FIFO
	underflow. Removed unnecessary stall checking. Signal stack on TX
	errors.

2001-07-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c: Minor cleanups, avoid use of diag_printf unless
	when debugging.

2001-07-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c: Use PCI_IO accessor macros instead of HAL IO
	macros. Added a few more CPU->PCI address conversions. Print
	controller data.
	
	* src/amd_pcnet.h: Added default PCI_IO accessor macros. Use
	PCI_IO accessor macros instead of HAL IO macros.

	* src/if_pcnet.c: Removed macros. Added new interrupt handling
	code. Added code to find resources via PCI library. Change from
	enaddr to esa. Use HAL_PCI_CPU_TO_BUS macros instead of phys
	address macro. Fix esa setup code. Debug output tidied up.

	* src/amd_pcnet.h: Moved macros here. Added definitions for 32 bit
	RD/TD (unused). Changes for PCI configury.

	* cdl/amd_pcnet_eth_drivers.cdl: Removed static esa option (now
	per-device option). Added dev count option.

	* src/if_pcnet.c: Get rid of within_send.
	* src/amd_pcnet.h: Same.

	* src/if_pcnet.c: Fix compile error.

2001-04-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c: More updates.

	* src/amd_pcnet.h: A few more defs.

	* cdl/amd_pcnet_eth_drivers.cdl: Removed write EEPROM option.

	* src/if_pcnet.c: Fix link status check code. Change some C types
	to cyg types.
	* src/amd_pcnet.h (get_reg, put_reg): Also access ANR registers. 

	* src/amd_pcnet.h: Macros for accessing structure elements.
	* src/if_pcnet.c: Use those macros.	

2001-04-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c: Keep local counter of where to expect RX
	packets. Appears that the receive ring counter always points at
	the first buffer.
	(pcnet_poll): Handle RX events before TX events. 
	Make sure to not accidently clear IENA flag.

	* src/if_pcnet.c: Added RX code.
	* src/amd_pcnet.h: A few more defs.

2001-04-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_pcnet.c (amd_pcnet_init): Feed controller physical address.

	* Cloned from LAN91Cxx driver.
