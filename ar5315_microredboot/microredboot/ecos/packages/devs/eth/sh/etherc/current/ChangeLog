	* src/if_etherc.c: Fix builing with lwip.

2002-06-14  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/if_etherc.c: 
	Need to include <pkgconf/io_eth_drivers.h> for proper configuration
	of stand-alone (polled) vs. system (interrupt driven) mode.

2002-03-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/if_etherc.c (etherc_RxEvent): ensure Receive Request is always
	enabled.

2002-03-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_etherc.h: Removed some unused definitions.

	* src/if_etherc.c (etherc_poll): Move the bit of code that ensures RX
	enabling down to the exit of the function so it is always executed.

2002-03-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_etherc.c: Initialize interrupt field. Skip tests for
	suspended device - they are wrong.

	* src/phyter.inl (_MII_RENEGOTIATE): split delay out in new
	_MII_RENEGOTIATION_WAIT macro.
	(_MII_SPEED_FORCE_10MB): Added.

	* src/if_etherc.c (sh_etherc_init): Added forced-10Mbit
	option. Cleaned up some fix mes.

2002-03-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_etherc.c: Disabled PHY errata workaround. Make sure
	promisuous mode is disabled per default. Don't clear the wrap-bit
	of the RD table.

	* src/sh_etherc.h: Added a definition.

2002-02-21  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_etherc.c (_MII_HAS_EXTENDED): define.

2002-02-20  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_etherc.c: Pad packets to minimum ethernet frame
	length. Added PHY erratum workaround.

	* src/sh_etherc.h: Remove debug setting.

	* src/phyter.inl: Added here for now.

	* src/if_etherc.c: Include phyter.inl.
	(sh_etherc_init): Fix ring initialization. Set to continuous
	reception.
	(etherc_start): Tell FIFO to dump data in memory.
	(etherc_control): Use _MII functions to gather necessary
	information.
	(etherc_can_send): Same.
	Added _MII accessor macros and some extra debug code.

2002-02-19  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_etherc.h: Moved debug print code here. Tweak debug
	functions.
	* src/if_etherc.c: Tweaked the init and TX code some. Don't check
	for CYGARC_REG_EESR_ECI in the poll function as it does not appear
	to get set when other requests are. Moved debug print code to
	header file.

	* src/sh_etherc.h: More definitions.

	* src/if_etherc.c: Fix typos. Add interrupt attach code. Update
	remaining functions to support this controller.
