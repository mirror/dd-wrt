	* include/devs_eth_frv400.inl: Use unsigned char for printing. Check
	for no MAC address being given.
	* include/devs_eth_frv400.inl: Read MAC address from ID PROM bytewise.
	Add 'setmac' RedBoot command for setting the MAC address in the EEPROM.

2002-05-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/devs_eth_frv400.inl: Use CYGINT_IO_ETH_INT_SUPPORT_REQUIRED
	instead of CYGPKG_NET where required.

2002-03-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/frv400_eth_drivers.cdl: Don't define CYGHWR_NET_DRIVERS as this
	is done in the generic driver.

2001-12-10  Richard Sandiford  <rsandifo@redhat.com>

	* include/devs_eth_frv400.inl (_frv400_eth_int_clear): Don't
	unmask the interrupt after clearing it.

2001-10-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/devs_eth_frv400.inl: Specify buffer layout (change in
	generic driver requires this).

2001-10-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/devs_eth_frv400.inl: Allow configuration to force ESA
	(in case EEPROM is bad), otherwise make sure EEPROM is used to
	set chip address (ESA) before use.

2001-10-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/devs_eth_frv400.inl: Add PCI scanning for device.
	(_frv400_eth_int_clear): Need explicit interrupt acknowledge.

2001-10-10  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/devs_eth_frv400.inl: 
	* cdl/frv400_eth_drivers.cdl: New device driver for onboard LAN,
	based on RTL8029s which is the same as DP8390 (NE2000).
