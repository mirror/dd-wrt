2004-01-15  Jeff Daly  <jeffrey.daly@intel.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: support for large EEPROMs

2004-01-05  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Names of FLASH config types changed.

2003-02-27  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (eth_set_mac_address): Correct writing
	of wrong address to EEPROM.

2003-02-22  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Fix endian issues with EEPROM writing.
	Use read-modify-write to set EEPROM mac address. Support
	writing to EEPROM the mac address obtained from
	CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_GET_ESA.

2003-02-12  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Remove restriction preventing combination of
	*_GET_ESA and *_HAS_EEPROM.

2003-01-03  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: 
	* cdl/intel_i82559_eth_drivers.cdl: Allow finer control over
	debug (chatter) by making control booldata.

2002-12-17  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_ENDIAN_NEUTRAL_IO): New
	flag to support systems where PCI IO operations are not affected by
	CPU endianess.

2002-10-06  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/if_i82559.c (pci_init_find_82559s): Changed scope of 
	max_interrupt_handle since its needed in other places.
	* src/if_i82559.c (i82559_stop): Corrected wrong name of variable
	in a diag_printf function.

2002-07-24  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (pci_init_find_82559s): 
	Allow platform to define CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_USE_MEMORY
	which forces use of memory instead of I/O space for device access.

2002-06-14  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/if_i82559.c: 
	Need to include <pkgconf/io_eth_drivers.h> for proper configuration
	of stand-alone (polled) vs. system (interrupt driven) mode.

2002-04-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (i82559_stop): Free up any pending transmissions
	to prevent MBUF store leaks if the calling thread - the one that's
	shutting down the interface - priority ends up higher than (or
	same as) the network service threads.

2002-03-26  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (wait_for_cmd_done): Don't assert if RUC_ADDR_LOAD
	command doesn't clear - on some chips it never does.

2002-03-18  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (pci_init_find_82559s): Move allocation of
	statistics pointer for each device to here, out of
	i82559_start().  It used to leak PCI window store every time the
	interface cycled down/up.  [Case 107110]

2002-02-25  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Don't call PacketRxReady in standalone configuration
	unless ready to accept a packet. Limit packet delivery to one packet at
	a time in standalone configuration.

2002-02-20  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/i82559_info.h: New fields to record/control multicast
	all reception, oversized packet reception and promiscuous mode
	neatly.

	* src/if_i82559.c: Initial support for multicast address reception
	filtering.
	(i82559_restart): New routine to restart the device after fiddling
	with its setup - a tail recursion from i82559_start().
	(i82559_configure): More generic flags passed in and handled.
	(i82559_set_multicast): Routine to pass a set of addresses into
	the device; it works out the bitmap et al for us!
	(i82559_ioctl): Handle new case arms ETH_DRV_SET_MC_LIST and
	ETH_DRV_SET_MC_ALL if defined.  Reset and restart the device,
	diddling its status between.
	
2002-02-19  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (pci_init_find_82559s): Don't use IRQ support if
	CYGPKG_IO_ETH_DRIVERS_STAND_ALONE.

2002-01-28  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (pci_init_find_82559s): Removed CYG_ASSERT which
	assumed system PCI window exists.

2002-01-10  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (find_82559s_match_func): Add some more compatible PCI
	ids.

2002-01-03  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (pci_init_find_82559s): Remove check that
	assumes driver owns entire PCI window.

	* cdl/intel_i82559_eth_drivers.cdl: Add
	CYGNUM_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_MAX_TX_DESCRIPTORS and
	CYGNUM_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_MAX_RX_DESCRIPTORS.

2001-11-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2001-11-19  Anssi Pulkkinen <Anssi.Pulkkinen@ascom.ch>

	* src/if_i82559.c (TxMachine): The test to see if there is a new
	tx to start must also say "go" if the tx queue is full.  Normally,
	if the txqueue is full, a tx will be occurring at all times - so
	one will complete soon, so the tx queue full flag will soon be
	cleared, and this condition will recover.  I suspect a subtle race
	which effectively means a new tx is queued and fills the queue in
	between two tx's, so no TxDone() follows, causes the hang which we
	get without this extra test under high load.  [CASE 106686]

2001-09-20  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Add declaration of 'i82559_stop' to quiet warning.

2001-09-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/intel_i82559_eth_drivers.cdl: 
	* src/if_i82559.c: 
	Remove the tickle thread from this driver.  The functionality is
	now in the network timeout functionality which handles the
	"deliver" calls.  So it's only called if the net is quiet.

2001-09-12  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (TxDone): Defensive programming; zero the Tx key
	in the global data before making the callback.  This change
	appeared useful in our forebear, the EBSA-specific driver.

2001-08-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/intel_i82559_eth_drivers.cdl: New CDL options called 
	CYGPKG_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_TICKLE_THREAD, .._PRIORITY and
	.._DELAY to control the thread.  By default this is all disabled
	because it is not needed for a real network application which
	itself proactively tries to use the net - it's only needed when
	the app is totally passive, so the driver otherwise does not get
	CPU time at all.
	
	* src/if_i82559.c (starti82559ticklethread): New code to start a
	thread (!) to catch lost interrupts and thus restart jammed
	hardware.  It's only possible if KERNEL and NET - RedBoot is
	unaffected, and it's not needed for RedBoot 'cos RedBoot polls.
	(TxMachine): An assert about the CU idle status sometimes fired;
	made the code more conservative wrt timing here.
	(comments): more documentation on the possible external configury
	by .inl file, described the two TIMEOUT macros that can be set,
	and indeed must be to use the tickling thread meaningfully.

2001-08-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: 
	printf() is no longer a part of RedBoot.  Thus all programs
	must use diag_printf() and related functions instead.

2001-06-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (i82559_init): Handle EEPROMS without CRC.

2001-05-16  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (udelay): Use virtual vector rather than assuming
	hal_delay_us() exists.

2001-04-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (pciwindow_mem_alloc): If asked, by
	CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_PCIMEM_DISCONTIGUOUS, check for
	breaks in the physical address of PCI window memory, and discard
	any block with a break in it, then redo the alloc.  This is for
	targets where smaller SDRAM chips are fitted than the address
	width, so they end up with gaps in (physical) memory.

2001-04-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (i82559_init): Support hardware with only one
	serial EEPROM attached to one device, but multiple devices.  This
	generally involves moving some decisions for eg. programming
	EEPROM or not, optionally from compiletime to runtime.  Improved
	the diagnostics a bit also, and fixed some bugs.
	(eth_set_mac_address): now takes an arg to say whether we want to
	program the EEPROM, or are just setting up the chip.
	(i82559_ioctl): This is the only place we set that arg to write
	the EEPROM, startup never tries to write EEPROM from any external
	source such as configured ESA or RedBoot params.

2001-04-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (i82559_start): Warnings fixed; unused vars
	following previous change.

2001-04-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (i82559_start): Do not wait for command
	completion after the initial DUMPSTATS operation.  The code to
	wait was bogus; it was looking at the structure in the wrong way.
	In any case, there is no need to wait, the wait_for_cmd_done() in
	any following activity is good enough.

2001-03-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (update_statistics): Fix warning - only declare
	op_i82559 if we use it - from previous change.

2001-03-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (i82559_can_send, i82559_send): Count up and
	down entries into these routines, and always say "no" to
	can_send() if we are recursing, ie. within_send != 0.  This is a
	good idea because it limits stack usage.  The recursion happens
	because of the very neccessary polling of rx state within the tx
	routines - which can deliver packets up into the stack, which can
	trigger a response tx and so on...  Also fixed a harmless bug
	where, after polling, the p_i82559 current device state pointer
	pointer to the wrong device, if we polled both devs regardless; it
	only caused problems with the within_send recursion count.

	* include/i82559_info.h (I82559): Add within_send field.

2001-03-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (i82559_init): Support external macro
	CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_GET_ESA(...), which if defined, is
	used to acquire a MAC address, on the assumption that there is no
	EEPROM present.  CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_HAS_NO_EEPROM
	confirms that there is no EEPROM attached to the 82559(s) so we
	can omit all that code.  It's in the negative sense because it's
	the unusual case.

2001-03-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_DEMUX_ALL): Fully
	enable "DEMUX_ALL" option; all devices are scanned for
	activity/wedging/interrupts at every opportunity.  Multiple
	devices on the same interrupts are now supported.

2001-03-12  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (i82559_configure): New routine combines actions
	of eth_set_promiscuous_mode() and eth_set_config() both of which
	disappear.  Thus the device is always configured correctly from
	the start.  [from a patch from Martin Buck  <martin.buck@ascom.ch>
	via the EBSA285 driver]
	(eth_dsr): Do not call upper layer unless we are in a networked
	[non-RedBoot, non-polled] environment.  This is necessary because
	we call our own DSR from foreground to unstick after a lost
	interrupt.
	(find_82559s_match_func): New routine to discover disparate
	devices on the PCI bus.  Used in pci_init_find_82559s().
	(dump_txcb): Various junk debug functions removed.

2001-03-12  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Some tidying up, and two main additions to the
	mechanisms used for managing this nasty entomological device.
	(i82559_can_send): [amongst other places] if it is defined, use
	CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_MISSED_INTERRUPT(p_i82559) to detect
	that we missed an interrupt - and if so, call the ISR and DSR
	directly.  This is necessary for edge-triggered interrupt
	controllers being fed by this level-sending device, where an
	internal event in the device can keep the line low after the code
	thinks that all events have been handled.
	(Check82559TxLockupTimeout): This routine runs a timeout (if the
	HAL provides a pair of watchdog-like macros) which performs a
	selective reset of the device if it takes too long to transmit.
	This happens rarely, but when it happens this is the only way out;
	the tx machine is fixated on one tx and never comes out of it.
	

	Sadly these two techniques to escape lockup only work if the
	driver is called (ie. the stack tries to tx); incoming packets
	cannot unwedge a device.  We might need to add a poll from the
	stack in future if this causes problems.
	
	* include/i82559_info.h (I82559): Added two words for managing tx
	lockup timeouts since this must be per-device.

2001-03-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Remove "Platform specific - defaults provided"
	definitions for CYGHWR_INTEL_I82559_PCI_MEM_MAP_BASE/SIZE; all
	platforms now provide these.
	Added a little further disclaimer to the comment about LE/BE/GE.

2001-03-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Global change: what was HAL_READ_UINTxx or
	HAL_WRITE_UINTxx are now READMEMxx or WRITEMEMxx - just
	convenience macros that do all the volatile casts we want there.
	Definitions of INL, INW, INB and OUTL, OUTW, OUTB recast in terms
	of HAL_READ_UINTxx or HAL_WRITE_UINTxx so that they will use
	proper IO operations on those CISCy mainframes that have a special
	way of doing IO.

2001-03-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Much more configury added, so that I can use it
	with a new target board.  Including, but not limited to:

	o An essay about addressing, big endian, little endian and GIB
	endian (sic) and how we treat the various types of access within
	this module.  In other words, a lot of comments.

	o CYGNUM_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_SEPARATE_MUX_INTERRUPT to clarify
	that such an interrupt is SEPARATE from any simplex intrs that are
	also available.

	o CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_DEMUX_ALL for hardware where the
	the only interrupt is a multiplexed (wire or'd) one.  Plus
	associated macros for direct manipulation of interrupt masks and
	acknowledgments.

	o Support for external definition from the platform HAL or driver
	config module of CYGHWR_INTEL_I82559_PCI_MEM_MAP_BASE and SIZE.
	Also CYGHWR_INTEL_I82559_PCI_VIRT_TO_BUS.

	o LE definitions of a few macros that were missing.

	o Separated definitions of structure offsets from BE/LE
	definitions of consts within the words.  Offsets vary with GIB
	endian, for those CPUs who just flip bits.  No change for BE
	machines, needed for LE machines to work.  To enable address-flip
	within structures, define CYG_ADDRESSING_IS_GIBENDIAN.

	o Re-org of mux/simplex deliver and isr's for new configuration.

	o Couple of extra debug printouts.

2001-01-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Added FIXME for promiscuous mode.

2001-01-25  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Replace CYGNUM_HAL_INTERRUPT_PCI_IRQ with
	CYGNUM_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_MUX_INTERRUPT which platform .inl
	must provide when appropriate. Changed _deliver functions to match
	_isr functions.
	* include/i82559_info.h: Remove debug hacks.
	Fix declaration.

	* src/if_i82559.c: Moved device descriptors into platform header.
	Allow individual devices to hardwire ESA. Handle N devices instead
	of just 1 or 2.
	* include/i82559_info.h: ESA hardwired flag added.
	* cdl/intel_i82559_eth_drivers.cdl: Device details moved to
	platform CDL.

	* src/if_i82559.c (i82559_start): Poll status after dump command.

2001-01-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: [changes from yesterday] Some more endian
	fiddle, and the device coughs out the initial ARP packets.
	(wait_for_cmd_done): semantics changed to wait for pending CU
	cmds.
	(i82559_reset): Cleaned up to spec. Init register bases after
	reset.
	Fix initialization of hardwired ESA.
	Correct configuration command.
	Fix rcv len masking.
	(eth_set_mac_address): Set driver's ESA as well. Proper check for
	completion.
	Fix LE structure offsets.
	(i82559_start): Call new eth_set_config to enable device. Last
	hacks cleaned up.
	Remove a few printfs.

2001-01-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Debug hackery and some endian issues resolved.

2001-01-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Major changes, getting rid of device structures
	in favor of HAL IO accessor macros. Also added endian conversion
	macros where required.
	* include/i82559_info.h: Change type of device structures to char.

2001-01-19  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/intel_i82559_eth_drivers.cdl: Hack for just one interface
	now.
	* src/if_i82559.c: Fix IO functions. Handle EEPROM not being
	attached to device.

	* src/if_i82559.c: Use uncached/physical address translation
	macros.

2001-01-15  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c: Handle endian differences between controller
	and CPU. Leave usdelay to HAL. Hack around PCI-base-at-0
	assumption.
	Increase SK_DELAY (not that it changed anything, but now it's to
	the spec), hardwire static ESA.
	
2001-01-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_i82559.c (pci_init_find_82559s): Check that device has
	been found before accessing it. 
	(pci_init_find_82559s): Only delay if devices were
	found. Recognize 82559ER code as well.

2001-01-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>
	
	* src/if_i82559.c: Minor hacks to get it to build.
	* include/i82559_info.h: Same.
	* cdl/intel_i82559_eth_drivers.cdl: Same.

2000-12-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/intel_i82559_eth_drivers.cdl: Cloned from the EBSA driver.
	* include/i82559_info.h: Same.
	* src/if_i82559.c: Same.

2000-11-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (pci_init_find_82559s): Intel has at least
	two devices equivalent to the 82559.  Support both (0x1229, 0x01030).

2000-10-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c: Deal with device interrupts in a nested
	fashion - disable/restore is the semantics now, rather than
	unconditionally unmasking.  Also go directly to the 21285 PIC's
	interrupt control registers to gain atomicity for these.  Poll for
	ready received packets when acknowledging an interrupt in the
	tranmitting world; a race here could lose an Rx interrupt.  Which
	doesn't matter on a busy system, but in quieter times...  there
	will always be such a race because of the vague way the i82559's
	status bits reflect how it's yanking the interrupt line; you have
	to poll until the interrupt is gone before returning else spurious
	interrupt failures occur.  The issue is to close the window as
	tightly as possible, which this change achieves at a minor cost in
	performance - because of the time spent polling when not required.

2000-09-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (i82559_poll): Only diddle the interface we
	were asked to.  This is more correct in terms of the intent of the
	API, though it shouldn't really be necessary.

2000-09-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (pci_init_find_82559s): Add asserts and an
	unconditional check that the PCI window as configured matches the
	address and size of the pci_window region from the MLT.  This is
	here because at present the MLT and CT cannot intercommunicate
	enough.  The separation of the PCI window is needed because
	otherwise the malloc heap will eat all memory.  [This is related
	to CR 902624-CR, "MLT needs to be configuration aware"]

2000-09-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* OVERVIEW: This is part of the change to the network stack to
	greatly reduce latencies both of (other) DSRs and of thread
	scheduling.  All the work that the network stack *and* individual
	ether drivers used to do in DSRs (including alarm callbacks and
	data copies to/from the device memory) is moved into a "fast
	network thread" instead.  It calls a device's "deliver" function
	to do the work that was previously in the DSR.  This is a separate
	thread so that it can be set higher priority than application
	threads in order to minimize packet loss (depending on the
	driver), if required (the application threads presumed to be
	higher priority in turn than the network thread).  A crucial
	consequence of this is that we are no longer locking against DSRs,
	so a plain mutex can be used rather than the global scheduler
	lock, thus simplifying all the splfoo/splx() style functions.

	* src/if_ebsa285.c: Minor: fix the big assert in i82559_send()
	which suffered a race condition when called from the fast thread
	rather than from a DSR.  Major: Add a "deliver" entry to the
	interface record for the "fast thread" implementation of the
	network internal comms system.  Provide a pass-up DSR to the
	logical ether driver's DSR and appropriate delivery routine(s).
	i82559_poll() now calls i82559_deliver() rather than the DSR.  Add
	valid data for mux'd DSR to pass on up.

2000-09-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/test_net_realtime.h: Tighten up the latency requirements
	by a factor of 5; it all seems happy, so committed.

2000-08-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (i82559_ioctl): A little further diddling; have
	a bool to say whether the dot3 info is filled in.

2000-08-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl: Do not export a symbol for the
	device info file (include/ebsa285_info.h) since nobody needs
	(portably) to include it now.

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (i82559_ioctl): Handle new ioctl calls
	ETH_DRV_GET_IF_STATS_UD and ETH_DRV_GET_IF_STATS to get loads of
	statistical information out.  _UD means update.  The nonUD one can
	be used instead mostly, if we find the performance hit too large.
	This should allow SNMP (a) to not explode, (b) to get useful info
	out of other device implementations than this one.

	* include/ebsa285_info.h: Remove all the macro cruft for feature
	detecting of lots of individual statistics; we now just have a
	catch-all struct that SNMP uses, defined in the common ether
	driver environment.

2000-08-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (PacketRxReady): Put back the check for very
	small packets into the driver; the layer above checks for that
	(defensive programming) but only *after* asserting that the size
	is large enough, to help detect that scenario from other drivers.
	I believe we only have struct ether_header available if CYGPKG_NET
	but I could be wrong.
	[CASE 104353]

2000-08-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (eth_set_promiscuous_mode):
	- ccs->config_bytes[18]=0x70;
	+ ccs->config_bytes[18]=0x72; // Keep the Padding Enable bit
	...otherwise short frame sends don't work in promisc mode.
	[CASE 104289]

2000-08-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (pciwindow_mem_alloc): Take out very noisy debug.

2000-08-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c: Changes for stand-alone mode.

	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl: Ethernet driver package hierarchy changed.
	Add option to control number of interfaces.

2000-07-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (PacketRxReady): Do not attempt to forward
	short packets; eth_drv.c assumes there is at least a header there.
	(i82559_recv): Also be more careful and ASSERTive about -ve buffer
	sizes; be more defensive about sglists.  [CASE 104206]

2000-07-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c: Update for new eth_drv interfaces.

2000-07-18  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (i82559_poll): Fill in the flesh of this, it
	just calls ISR and DSR repeatedly.
	(i82559_start): Look in the device record for promiscuous mode
	flag; it should be passed though the common layer, but it's not
	[yet] - this change from Andrew Lunn/ASCOM.  Also a fix and delay
	to the promisc mode code per se.

2000-07-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (i82559_poll): New function, just to fill in
	the interface record; not used.

2000-06-27  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl: Add sesquipedalian option
	CYGDBG_DEVS_ETH_ARM_EBSA285_KEEP_82559_STATISTICS in (now)
	component CYGDBG_DEVS_ETH_ARM_EBSA285_KEEP_STATISTICS to control
	keeping (well, harvesting really) the i82559's internal stats.
	Reputedly, it doesn't service the net whilst this is happening, so
	it could be viewed a bad thing.  Hence the option.

	* include/ebsa285_info.h: Only describe the I82559_COUNTERS
	i82559_counters[2]; structs if full stats are to be kept.

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (update_statistics): Only include this if full
	stats are to be kept.

2000-06-27  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (ResetRxRing): Re-do the management of the
	RxRing; have an end-of-list flag (EL) in the last entry, and as
	you unload filled slots, drag it round after you.

2000-06-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl: Add option to control statistics
	keeping.

	* include/ebsa285_info.h: Act on it.

2000-06-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl: Properly include the new header
	file and define symbols to allow client code to get at it without
	knowing the particular device driver name.

	* include/ebsa285_info.h: New file: export various statistics
	information about the driver for use by monitoring and
	network-management systems.  This requires exposing the
	(otherwise) internal structures of the driver.

	* src/if_ebsa285.c: remove a lot of structure definitions &c that
	are now necessarily in the new header; add a couple of new
	routines which provide status and update statistics from the
	device into memory; tidy up control of whether stats-keeping is
	enabled.

2000-06-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl (define_proc): Add #define of
	CYGDAT_DEVS_ETH_DESCRIPTION in the config file for information.

2000-05-12  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/test_net_realtime.h (tnr_print_activity): New routine to
	check the system is working, tidied up the API.  It works!

2000-05-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl: Added export of the test header
	below, and config opts for controlling EEPROM writing and all the
	status chatter as the device starts up.

	* src/if_ebsa285.c: Reworked the code for reading and setting the
	EEPROM that holds the MAC address.  This is very ugly, but now
	more reliable.  Also tidied up printing cruft with neater
	configury, and made it an option (for safety) whether it's
	possible to write the EEPROM at all.

	* tests/test_net_realtime.h: New file - it is intended to be used
	by networking tests to verify that latency is not compromised by
	the stack and driver.  It's very platform specific, hence the
	location in here.  This is a preliminary version only.

2000-04-27  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c: A serious re-write.  This cuts out a lot of
	code from the old version and improves the performance greatly.

	The cruft was mainly doing lots of explicit event communication
	between the ISR and DSR, when in fact all the state needed is
	present in the tx/rx rings.  So both ISRs and DSRs regard their
	call as an opportunity to progress everything they can, rather
	than only dealing with one interrupt cause at a time; the
	connection between them is now rather looser.

	Interrups can now be re-enabled after the ISR (in other words they
	are not masked in the ISR), no need to wait for the DSR, but in
	consequence some DSR code must mask/unmask intrs as it works.

	The 82559 appears to be a little slow in reacting to commands and
	state changes, so some interrupts were being lost - or persisting
	beyond their desired life - so there's some kinda polling code to
	deal with that also.  We also rely on the foreground to kind of
	poll in the same way, in the send/can_send calls - we know the
	stack will re-try if necessary, though this is rare.

	The driver now works (albeit at much reduced performance) with as
	few as 6 rx and tx buffers - in other words the "queue full/out of
	rx buffers" states have been tested and all is well.  It works
	generally fine with 8 buffers of each kind.

	The mux ISR and DSR are now rather more polled than the old
	versions; we just try to do things with both devices (if active)
	by simply calling each unitary ISR/DSR respectively.

	I also re-ordered some of the code, moving utilities to the end of
	the file and grouping together Tx and Rx machines a bit better.

2000-04-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c: Attribution to Ron Spence, Pacific Softworks
	added as a contributor.

2000-04-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* ecos.db: Re-organize device packages.  This is a massive change
	involving deleting all the sources for serial and ethernet drivers
	from where they used to live in
	    packages/io/serial/current/src/ARCH/PLATFORM.[ch]
	    packages/net/drivers/eth/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	and reinstating them in
	    packages/devs/serial/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	    packages/devs/eth/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...

	All these new packages are properly defined in ecos.db, and are
	all of type "hardware" so that a "target" can grab them.
	
	This directory layout is descriptive of the devices we have right
	now, arch and platform are separate levels just to make it easier
	to navigate in the filesystem and similar to the HAL structure in
	the filesystem.

	It is *not* prescriptive of future work; for example, the mythical
	common highly-portable 16550 serial driver which works on many
	targets would be called "devs/serial/s16550/current", or a serial
	device for a particular board (cogent springs to mind) that can
	work with different CPUs fitted is "devs/serial/cogent/current".

	Changelogs have been preserved and replicated over all the new
	packages, so that no history is lost.

	The contents of individual source files are unchanged; they build
	in just the same emvironment except for a very few cases where the
	config file name changed in this movement.

	Targets in ecos.db have been redefined to bring in all relevant
	hardware packages including net and serial drivers (but the newly
	included packages are only active if their desired parent is
	available.)
	
	The names of CDL options (and their #defines of course) stay the
	same for the serial drivers, for backward compatibility.

	* templates/*/current.ect: these have had CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL added
	rather than it being in (almost) all target definitions.
	
2000-03-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (i82559_recv): Be happy with NULLs in the
	SGlist; it means the caller is out of memory so drop the packet on
	the floor.  Also remove a completely redundant test.

2000-03-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (i82559_can_send): Update net driver to new
	interface style.  This is incomplete wrt promiscuous mode, but
	that's probably about all.

2000-02-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl: Update CDL to indicate multiple 
	interface support.

2000-02-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (pci_init_find_82559s): Tidy comments somewhat
	and set debug and stats collecting defines to most friendly
	settings.

2000-02-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (PacketRxReady): Fix bug; current descriptor
	was not being write back for the callback to use.  Hence asserts
	on state of rfd were firing in busy times - that leading rfd had
	already been drained.

	Also rationalized meaning of DEBUG printy symbols a bit - it's now
	chatty during startup/foreground manipulations but not in any
	performance related activities ie. rx or tx.

2000-02-09  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl:

	Reparent under CYGPKG_NET_ETH_DRIVERS and tidy display strings.

2000-02-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c: New File.
	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl: New File.

	Initial Checkin of EBSA285 Ethernet driver.

	It's one monolithic file at present, and should be split up into a
	more generic Intel 82559 driver plus platform-specific parts (PCI
	et al) plus eCos/Red-Hat-BSD-stack parts.
