2004-09-24  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx (enqueue): Fix bug in sorted queue
	insertion: priority test was inverted. Spotted by TomChen.

2004-08-08  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/counters.cdl: add new option for the clock interrupt
	priority.

	* src/common/clock.cxx (Cyg_RealTimeClock): use this option.

2004-04-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests/fptest.c (do_test): Silence aliasing warning when breaking
	doubles into two ints.

2004-04-11  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* doc/kernel.sgml: Expanded the documentation about the use of
	CYG_FLAG_WAITMODE_CLR.

2004-03-27  Sebastien Couret	<sebastien.couret@elios-informatique.fr>

	* src/debug/dbg-thread-demux.c (dbg_thread_syscall_rmt): Only
	needed if CYGDBG_KERNEL_DEBUG_GDB_THREAD_SUPPORT is enabled.

2004-03-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/kapi.h: Add throw specifications throughout.
	* src/kapi.cxx: Ditto.
	* include/sched.inl: Move include of thread.inl further down to
	allow Cyg_Scheduler inlines to be defined first.
	* include/thread.inl: Reorder destructors section and include
	sched.inl right before it to solve mutual header dependency
	problems.

2004-03-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* doc/kernel.sgml: Document cyg_thread_delete return value.

2004-02-19  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests/kmutex3.c (cyg_start): Use CYG_TEST_NA.
	* tests/kmutex4.c (cyg_start): Ditto.
	* tests/mutex2.cxx (cyg_start): Ditto.
	* tests/mutex3.cxx (cyg_start): Ditto.
	* tests/sync3.cxx (cyg_start): Ditto.
	* tests/thread2.cxx (cyg_start): Ditto.

	* tests/fptest.c (cyg_start): Use one line NA msg.
	* tests/smp.cxx (cyg_start): Ditto.
	* tests/timeslice.c (cyg_start): Ditto.
	* tests/tm_basic.cxx (cyg_start): Ditto.

2003-12-08  Dan Jakubiec  <djakubiec@yahoo.com>

	* src/common/kapi.cxx: Added new function cyg_thread_get_id().
	This function returns the unique thread ID for a given thread
	handle.

	* include/kapi.h: Added function prototype for cyg_thread_get_id().

	* doc/kernel.sgml: Added documentation for cyg_thread_get_id().

2003-10-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* src/common/clock.cxx (Cyg_Counter::tick): Changed code to deal
	with manipulation of unsorted lists (see ChangeLogs passim). There
	are several corner cases where the current code does not
	work. Replaced with a more straightforward, but slightly more
	expensive, implementation.

2003-09-22  Reinhard Jessich  <Reinhard.Jessich@frequentis.com>

	* src/common/clock.cxx: Removed	label/goto
	add_alarm_unlock_return to get rid of compiler error when
	CYGIMP_KERNEL_COUNTERS_SORT_LIST is enabled.

2003-09-01  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* doc/kernel.sgml: fix typo, cyg_thread vs. cyg_thread_t

2003-07-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* cdl/counters.cdl: Removed the counters override CDL
	options. These are no longer very useful, since too much
	non-kernel code now uses the HAL options to get these values.

2003-07-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* src/common/clock.cxx (Cyg_Counter::tick): In unsorted list case:
	moved saving of next node details to before re-insertion of alarms
	with intervals. The call to add_alarm() can make enough of a
	difference to the list to need to force a rescan.

2003-07-06  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* include/test/stackmon.h (cyg_test_size_a_stack):
	If stack checking is enabled, look for 0xdeadbeef rather than 0x0
	to determine usage. Also reset the interrupt stack to that value.

2003-07-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* doc/kernel.sgml: Document that timeouts for timed functions are
	absolute, not relative. Also document new semantics for
	cyg_semaphore_timed_wait() for timeouts in the past.

2003-07-01  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* include/clock.hxx: Made Cyg_Counter::add_alarm() and
	Cyg_Counter::rem_alarm() private functions. They no longer lock
	the scheduler, so should not be called directly, only via the
	Cyg_Alarm functions.

	* include/clock.inl: Removed inline version of
	Cyg_Alarm::disable(). It's no longer a one-liner and is thus
	better as a proper function.

	* src/common/clock.cxx (Cyg_Counter::tick): Rewrote the unsorted
	list option. If the function of one alarm adds or removes other
	alarms, then is was possible for the list to become corrupted. The
	new implementation attempts to avoid this problem.
	(Cyg_Alarm::initialize): Added scheduler locking to protect the
	enabled flag.
	(Cyg_Alarm::enable): Ditto.
	(Cyg_Alarm::disable): Ditto. Moved here from clock.inl.
	(Cyg_Alarm::add_alarm): Removed scheduler locking, it is now
	always called from functions that have already locked it. Added an
	assertion to double-check this.
	(Cyg_Alarm::rem_alarm): Ditto.

	* cdl/kernel.cdl:
	* tests/kalarm0.c:
	Added new test to test that alarms can be added and removed in
	alarm functions safely.
	
2003-06-25  Thomas Binder  <Thomas.Binder@frequentis.com>

	* src/common/clock.cxx (Cyg_Counter::rem_alarm): Bugfix: call
	Cyg_Scheduler::lock() before calculation of index into alarm_list
	array to avoid race condition with multi list counters.

2003-06-06  David Brennan  <eCos@brennanhome.com>
2003-06-23  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Added tests/bin_sem3 to list of kernel tests.

	* include/sema.hxx: Added declaration for wait with timeout for
        Cyg_Binary_Semaphore.
	
	* include/instrmnt.h: Added instrumentation point for binary semaphore
        timeout.
	
        * src/sync/bin_sem.cxx: Added wait with time-out function to 
        Cyg_Binary_Semaphore class. 

	* src/sync/cnt_sem.cxx: Modified semantics slightly to claim an
	available semaphore even with a timeout in the past. This is in
	line with the new timed wait in bin_sem.cxx. 

	* tests/bin_sem3.cxx: Created new test for timed wait binary
        semaphore.
		
2003-05-20  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/common/kapi.cxx (cyg_thread_get_next): Passing a *current
	pointer as NULL if how you start the walk of the linked list. So
	don't assert on NULL. Reported by Daniel Lidsten.

2003-05-05  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* tests/tm_basic.cxx: Support new option controlling number of times
	this test runs.  This is useful for long-term stress and performance
	analysis.

2003-05-03  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/mqueue.inl (Cyg_Mqueue::get): Fix invalid loop termination
	cheque for whether busy or not.
	(Cyg_Mqueue::put): Ditto.

2003-03-03  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests/fptest.c: Make all variables static to avoid any risk
	of collisions with symbols defined elsewhere in eCos.

2003-02-27  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/kapidata.h: Revert change of 2001-08-23 and instead make
	it conditional on the GCC version. Also add comments explaining why
	this file has been apparently obfuscated.

2003-02-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@calivar.com>

	* tests/fptest.c (alarm_fn): Added CYG_TEST_PASS() call to keep
	configtool happy.

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Update doc links.
	* cdl/synch.cdl: Ditto.
	* cdl/thread.cdl: Ditto.

2003-02-19  Nick Garnett  <nickg@calivar.com>

	* tests/fptest.c: Changed to run for a constant time rather than a
	constant number of iterations, with a shorter run time for
	simulated targets.

2003-02-10  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* include/thread.inl: Add more debug info to thread stack checking.

	* tests/clocktruth.cxx: 
	* tests/clockcnv.cxx: Use <cyg/infra/diag.h> for diag_printf()
	prototype, rather than hard coding (because it was inconsistent).

2003-02-05  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* tests/kcache2.c (test_dcache_operation): New test to verify
	that the DATA cache syncs properly.

2003-01-31  Nick Garnett  <nickg@calivar.com>

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: 
	* tests/fptest.c: Added this program to test interaction of FPU
	with multiple threads.

2003-01-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/common/thread.cxx: Fix potential warning and overflow with
	CYGNUM_KERNEL_THREADS_DATA_MAX == 32.

2003-01-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/common/kapi.cxx (cyg_thread_get_next): Be quite zealous about
	checking the validity of passed in threads in debug mode.
	(cyg_thread_get_info): Ditto.

	* cdl/thread.cdl: Correct max legal value for
	CYGNUM_KERNEL_THREADS_DATA_MAX.

2003-01-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* doc/kernel.sgml: Document cyg_thread_info type.

2003-01-13  Dmitriy Korovkin  <dkorovkin@rambler.ru>
2003-01-13  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/mqueue.hxx: Allow get/put to return time out.
	* include mqueue.inl: Ditto.

2003-01-02  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* tests/kcache2.c: New subtest for raw data cache operations.

2002-12-12  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/common/kapi.cxx: 
	* include/kapi.h:
	Added function cyg_thread_get_next(), cyg_thread_find() and
	cyg_thread_get_info() to allow the current set of threads to be
	enumerated, and per-thread information to be retrieved safely.

	* doc/kernel.sgml: Documented new KAPI calls.

	* src/common/thread.cxx: Zero unique_id in thread destructor so
	that a stale thread pointer can be checked for validity.

	* include/instrmnt.h:
	Added cyg_instrument_state() to report the current state of an
	instrumentation flag.
	Moved ifdef for CYGDBG_KERNEL_INSTRUMENT_MSGS out of within FLAGS
	ifdef. We can have messages without flags.

	* src/instrmnt/meminst.cxx: 
	Added cyg_instrument_state() to report the current state of an
	instrumentation flag.
	Modified cyg_instrument_msg() in line with header and table
	changes.

	* host/instr/dump_instr.c:
	* host/instr/instrument.sh:
	* include/instrument_desc.h: 
	Added a final NULL element to the generated table in
	instrument_desc.h to mark its end. Otherwise code that does not
	have access to the table definition cannot find its end. Also
	added ifdefs to allow instrument_desc.h to be used to acquire the
	structure definition and table pointer.

2002-12-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* tests/tm_basic.cxx: Add tests of 'flag' synchronizers.

2002-10-28  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* tests/tm_basic.cxx: Include infra/diag.h and removed the 
	incorrect prototype for diag_printf

2002-10-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* include/test/stackmon.h (STACKMON_PRINTF): Use #include to get
	prototype for 'diag_printf()'.

2002-10-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/common/clock.cxx (add_alarm): Tweak last change to allow
	alarm order for identical alarms to be the same as it used to be.

2002-09-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/common/clock.cxx (add_alarm): Fix bug resulting in alarms
	not being added at all if a lower triggered alarm already exists.
	Reported by Christoph Csebits.
	Also fix bug when alarm is entered for the same time as tail.
	These bugs only apply for CYGIMP_KERNEL_COUNTERS_SORT_LIST enabled.

	* doc/kernel.sgml: document that order of callback for alarms at
	identical times is unspecified.

2002-08-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@calivar.demon.co.uk>

	* src/sched/sched.cxx (unlock_inner): Removed initial
	assertion. This has served its purpose and with the introduction
	of routines such as unlock_reschedule() is prone to firing in
	otherwise benign circumstances.

2002-08-05  Bart Veer  <bartv@tymora.demon.co.uk>

	* cdl/kernel.cdl, include/kapidata.h, include/kapi.h:
	Allow configurations with the kernel but no malloc

2002-06-05  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* include/kapi.h: Fix prototype (to allow builds with net stack).

2002-05-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Fix typo.

2002-05-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/kapi.h: Expose new cyg_thread_add_destructor and
	cyg_thread_rem_destructor APIs.

	* include/kapidata.h (struct Cyg_Destructor_Entry):
	Change CYG_ADDRWORD to more correct cyg_addrword_t.

	* include/thread.hxx (class Cyg_Thread): add_destructor and
	rem_destructor are onyl static when not per-thread.

	* include/thread.inl (add_destructor): Don't need to lock and unlock
	scheduler when destructors are per-thread.
	(rem_destructor): Ditto.

	* src/common/thread.cxx (exit): No need to lock scheduler when
	calling destructors.

	* doc/kernel.sgml: Document thread destructor API.

2002-05-23  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* doc/kernel.sgml: Some more edits to the kernel documentation:
	changed all references to message boxes to mail boxes, clarified
	some thing in various places, fixed a few typos.

2002-05-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Cleaned up kernel tests rule. Also remove tests
	depending on the C API when its not present. And skip dhrystone
	test when debug or instrumentation is enabled.

	* tests/tm_basic.cxx: Fixed warning.

2002-05-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* doc/kernel.sgml:
	Fixed up SMP documentation.
	Rewrote condtion variable documentation to make its relationship
	to mutexes more apparent.

2002-05-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/smp.cxx: Move inclusion of testaux.hxx to below NA
	checks.

2002-05-21  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* doc/kernel.sgml:
	Major update to the kernel documentation.

2002-05-21  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/common/clock.cxx (dsr): Fix latency ifdef guards.
	* tests/tm_basic.cxx: Same.

2002-05-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx: Don't force timeslice tracing on by default
	against	the user's wishes.
	* cdl/scheduler.cdl: Instead provide an option controlling it.

2002-05-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/kapidata.h (CYG_HARDWARETHREAD_MEMBERS): entry_point
	should be a pointer to function not an addrword (which may be
	different).
	(cyg_reason_t): Define cyg_reason_t as an enum not an int.
	(struct cyg_mutex_t): Define mutex protocol as an enum not a cyg_uint32.
	Define locked member as a cyg_atomic, not a cyg_bool.

2002-05-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* tests/timeslice.c: Modified test thread to accumulate run time
	by reading HAL clock, and to detect and record changes of CPU. The
	previous version of this code reported varying results - probably
	as a consequence of cache effects.

	* include/instrmnt.h: Fixed left-over debug edit to MLQ
	instrumentation enable code.

2002-04-29  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/kapi.h: Added cyg_alarm_get_times and
	cyg_counter_multi_tick.
	* src/common/kapi.cxx: Same. Er, fix oversight.
	* doc/kernel.sgml: Doc update.

2002-04-24  Yoshinori Sato  <qzb04471@nifty.ne.jp>

	* src/sync/flag.cxx: Don't set default args in func definitions.

2002-04-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/dhrystone.c: Moved platform max number of passes to CDL in
	HALs.

2002-04-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/dhrystone.c: Allow platform to define max number of passes
	via CYGPRI_KERNEL_TESTS_DHRYSTONE_PASSES.

2002-04-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/kapi.h: Use NORET attributes from cyg_type.h.
	* include/sched.hxx (class Cyg_Scheduler): Ditto.

2002-04-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/sync/mutex.cxx: Added IF_PROTOCOL_ACTIVE macro to condition
	use of the mutex counter. This means that a mutex that is not
	configured to participate in a priority inversion protocol does not
	count for operation of that protocol. 

2002-03-04  Lars Viklund <lars.viklund@axis.com>

	* include/kapidata.h (CYG_SCHEDTHREAD_ASR_MEMBER): 
	asr_inhibit is cyg_ucount32 - must match

2002-02-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* doc/kernel.sgml: NEW FILE: Correct reference to uITRON doc.

2002-01-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/kexcept1.c: Fix warning.

2002-01-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/kcache1.c (time0DI): Disable interrupts around the
	sync+invalidate process.
	* tests/kcache2.c: Same.

2002-01-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/intr/intr.cxx (mask_interrupt): Disable interrupts.
	(unmask_interrupt): Ditto.
	(mask_interrupt_intunsafe): New function to avoid disabled interrupts.
	(unmask_interrupt_intunsafe): Ditto.
	* include/intr.hxx (class Cyg_Interrupt): Declare above new funcs.
	* src/common/kapi.cxx (cyg_interrupt_unmask_intunsafe): Above
	replicated to KAPI.
	(cyg_interrupt_mask_intunsafe): Ditto.
	* include/kapi.h: Ditto.

2002-01-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* tests/except1.cxx: 
	* tests/kexcept1.cxx:
	Added ifdef to disable these tests in ARM PID platform. This
	platform cannot generate any of the exceptions that this test
	needs to work.

2001-12-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/kcache2.c (time_ilock): Put some dummy goto statements in
	to prevent compiler from moving labels around.

2001-11-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx (timeslice_cpu): Reset timeslice_count on
	a timeslice.
	Noticed by Tony Kho.

2001-11-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/klock.c (entry1): Support running with
	CYGFUN_KERNEL_THREADS_TIMER disabled.

2001-10-30  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* tests/kcache2.c (test_dsync):
	Added call to HAL_ICACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL() just before DCACHE
	disable. In platforms where both caches are controlled together,
	such as the VR4300, not doing this can result in strange behaviour
	as the ICACHE gets turned off under the program's feet, when it is
	not ready for it.

2001-10-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/dhrystone.c: CYGINT_ISO_STRING_STRFUNCS check changed to
	ifdef.

2001-10-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/synch.cdl (CYGIMP_KERNEL_SYNCH_MQUEUE_NOT_INLINE): New option
	to avoid inlining mqueue implementation.

	* src/sync/mqueue.cxx: New file to provide non-inline version of
	mqueue functions.

	* include/mqueue.hxx: Don't include .inl if user doesn't want inlining.

	* include/mqueue.inl: Allow choice of inlining or not to be
	overridden by macro.

	* tests/mqueue1.cxx: Never use inline version.

2001-10-11  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/kmutex3.c (new_thread): Fixed allocation: increase counter
	before starting threads which have been allocated resources.
	* tests/kmutex4.c (new_thread): Same.
	* tests/mutex3.cxx (new_thread): Same.
	* tests/testaux.hxx (new_thread): Same.

	* tests/kcache2.c: Fixed warning.
	* tests/stress_threads.c: Same.

2001-09-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* host/instr/dump_instr.c (main): Fix argc check.

2001-09-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/thread.inl (measure_stack_usage): Deal with stack limits.

2001-09-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/common/thread.cxx (set_priority): Change argument to
	instrumentation call to new_priority rather than current
	priority. (Suggested by Andrew Lunn).

2001-09-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/mqueue.inl (Cyg_Mqueue): Initialize busy flag of last
	entry in the list.

2001-09-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/instrument.cdl (CYGDBG_KERNEL_INSTRUMENT_BUILD_HOST_DUMP): 
	Remove redundant requires, and adjust make rule to be more portable
	across hosts.
	(CYGDBG_KERNEL_INSTRUMENT_MSGS_BUILD_HEADERFILE):
	Invoke script with sh directly rather than rely on executable attribute.

	* host/instr/readme.txt: Update build of host dump as per the changed
	CDL.

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Don't build nullinst.cxx any more.
	Build meminst.cxx only in CYGPKG_KERNEL_INSTRUMENT.
	* src/instrmnt/nullinst.cxx: Delete. It causes confusion in the
	library as it declares cyg_instrument like meminst.cxx does.

2001-08-31  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/intr/intr.cxx: Clean up typo in DSR table
	case. dsr_table_tail and dsr_table_head were not being subscripted
	in a couple of places.

2001-08-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2001-08-20  Andrew Lunn <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/instrument_desc.h: New file.  This contains the table of
	events used to print the nice information.  It should be
	regenerated when the instrumentation numbers change.

	* src/instrmnt/meminst.cxx (cyg_instrument_msg):
	returns an ASCII string describing the type of event the
	instrumentation code logged.

	* include/instrmnt.h: Added function prototype.

	* cdl/instrument.cdl: Configury for enabling the new function, and
	optionally rebuilding its header file and building a host tool.

	* host/instr/dump_instr.c: New file.  A host program to print the
	instrumentation information in a human readable form.

	* host/instr/instrument.sh: New file.  Script to generate table of
	events with textual representation.

	* host/instr/readme.txt: New file.  Helpful information.

2001-08-23  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/kapidata.h (CYG_THREADTIMER_MEMBERS):
	Substituted an expicit cyg_alarm object for CYG_ALARM_MEMBERS in
	this definition. In some architectures (MIPS in particular) the
	structures need to be padded to a multiple of 64 bits. This was
	not happening with the macro substituted versions.
	This is just a temporary fix, I'll leave it to Jifl to sort out a
	real patch when he returns.

2001-08-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/common/thread.cxx: Properly qualify Cyg_Thread::destructors
	array so that it builds when destructors are not used.

2001-08-23  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx: Added code to
	Cyg_SchedThread_Implementation::to_queue_head() to handle a NULL
	thread queue pointer. This compensates for a minor change in
	behaviour of the scheduler.

2001-08-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/thread.cdl: Add kernel thread destructor options.
	* include/kapidata.h: Add thread destructor entries to cyg_thread
	* include/thread.hxx (Cyg_Thread): Give per-thread data indexes
	their own type, cyg_data_index.
	Include new thread destructor data members, and new add_destructor
	and rem_destructor member functions.
	* include/thread.inl: Use a cyg_data_index for per-thread data handle.
	(add_destructor): New Cyg_Thread member function.
	(rem_destructor): Ditto.
	* src/common/kapi.cxx: Use cyg_data_index type for per-thread data
	functions.
	* src/common/thread.cxx (Cyg_Thread): initialise per-thread
	destructors if needed.
	Define static destructors if needed.
	(exit): Call destructors.
	(new_data_index): Use cyg_data_index type.
	(free_data_index): Ditto.

2001-08-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
  
	* src/sync/mutex.cxx (Cyg_Mutex): Add initialization of the
	priority ceiling value in the non-dynamic protocol case.

2001-08-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* tests/intr0.c: 
	* tests/kintr0.c:
	Swapped order of interrupt enable/disable calls to keep kernel
	happy when assertions are enabled. Otherwise the enable call
	complains that interrupts have not been disabled.

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx:
	Simplified algorithm in set_need_reschedule().

	* include/smp.hxx: 
	* include/kapidata.h: Change spinlock to be a cyg_uint32, rather
	than a cyg_atomic.

	* src/intr/intr.cxx: 
	* include/intr.hxx:
	Now arrange for DSRs to be called on the same CPU as the ISR. This
	is necessary if the DSR needs to access per-CPU hardware (such as
	interrupt controllers). This is achieved by keeping a separate DSR
	list/table for each CPU.

	* tests/smp.cxx: Some modifications to make this test work in a
	real SMP environment.

	* tests/timeslice.c: 
	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Added timeslice test.

2001-08-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/sync/mutex.cxx (lock): Bugfix: a ceiling priority mutex
	wasn't elevated until after it had acquired the mutex.  This meant
	it slept with a low priority, and so did not run when awakened by
	the release of the mutex.  The fix is to elevate the potential
	claimant before it sleeps in contention. 

	* tests/kmutex4.c: New testcase - very similar to kmutex3 but it
	loops a load more times using different mutex priority protocols.
	This checks that dynamically set protos do in fact behave
	differently from one another and as they are each intended to.

	* tests/kmutex3.c: Remove FIXME comments - we now test dynamic
	protocol.

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Build the new test.

2001-08-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/kapidata.h: Reorganize most struct type definitions into
	macros to allow compatible layout with all G++ implementations that
	align non-POD types differently from included C structures.
	* include/kapi.h: Similarly for cyg_resolution_t.

2001-08-17  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx (timeslice): Fix timeslice_count comparison.

2001-08-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/kapi.h (cyg_mutex_protocol): Tidy up names of mutex
	protocol type and values.  These polluted rather in 'C'.

	* src/common/kapi.cxx (cyg_mutex_set_protocol): ditto.

2001-08-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2001-08-15  Andrew Lunn <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/common/kapi.c (cyg_thread_get_current_priority): Export
	this function into the C api.
	* include/kapi.h: Declaration of new function.

2001-08-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/common/kapi.cxx (cyg_spinlock_spin_intsave): Cast to istate
	to CYG_INTERRUPT_STATE * since that's what is needed.
	(cyg_spinlock_clear_intsave): Similarly.

2001-08-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/synch.cdl: Re-organize the options for mutexes so they are
	active a bit more sensibly; place the default ceiling within
	selection of ceiling protocol, and only have a default protocol if
	there is more than one protocol active.

	* tests/mutex3.cxx: More detailed handling of the possibility of
	ceiling protocol instead of the inherit or none cases; we can run
	the test ok and treat as inherit if the ceiling prio is higher
	than 5, treat as none if lower than 15, and don't check anything
	if in between - the test runs happily.

	* tests/kmutex3.c (cyg_start): New test, a KAPI translation of the
	now-classic mutex3.cxx.

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Build tests/kmutex3.c

2001-08-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/sched/sched.cxx (unlock_inner): Fix assignment to current,
	wouldn't build if stack checking after merger from SMP branch.

2001-08-06  Andrew Lunn   <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>
2001-08-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/sync/mutex.cxx: (set_protocol) Added a function to set the
	priority inversion protocol for a mutex.

	* src/common/kapi.cxx: Export the new function above and
	set_ceiling into the C API.
	
	* include/mutex.hxx (class Cyg_Mutex): New member function
	set_protocol().

	* include/kapi.h (cyg_protcol): Define new emumeration for mutex
	priority protocol setting, and headers for the new function to set
	it.

2001-08-03  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	Imported from a development branch:
	
	2001-07-11  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

		* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx: Changed behaviour of
		set_need_reschedule() to a better implementation of the intended
		algorithm.

		* include/kapi.h: 
		* src/common/kapi.cxx:
		Added API for controlling routing of interrupts to CPUs in SMP
		configurations.

	2001-07-03  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

		* cdl/scheduler.cdl:
		* include/bitmap.hxx:
		* src/sched/bitmap.cxx:
		Fixed up bitmap scheduler so it still works within the
		SMP-modified scheduling infrastructure. The bitmap scheduler
		is not currently SMP-enabled, only single CPU configurations are
		supported - hence the CDL change to require this.

	2001-06-29  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

		* src/sched/sched.cxx:
		Removed the call to Cyg_Interrupt::enable_interrupts() in
		Cyg_Scheduler::start_cpu(). This was a relic from the days when
		the interrupt enable state was not part of the thread state. Now
		it is, and loading the first thread will cause interrupts to be
		enabled.

		* src/intr/intr.cxx:
		Changed initial values of Cyg_Interrupt::disable_counter[]s to
		zero as a result of the change in Cyg_Scheduler::start_cpu().

		* include/kapi.h:
		* include/kapidata.h:
		* src/common/kapi.cxx: 
		Added API for using spinlocks. Largely so that it may be extended
		to the driver API.

		* include/mlqueue.hxx:
		* include/intr.hxx:
		* include/sched.hxx:
		Added annotations to various static variables.

	2001-06-28  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

		* include/intr.hxx:
		* src/intr/intr.cxx:
		Changed behaviour of Cyg_Interrupt::disable_interrupts() and
		Cyg_Interrupt::enable_interrupts(). These now claim and release a
		spinlock in addition to disabling and enabling interrupts. The
		original interrupt state is also preserved and restored. This is
		necessary in SMP systems to allow drivers etc. to correctly
		synchronize with threads and DSRs that may be running on different
		CPUs. In the single CPU case this mechanism reduces to the
		original simple interrupt disable code.
		[Later change] Backed off addition of volatile modifier to
		interrupt_disable_state.

		* include/smp.hxx: Some minor tidies.

	2001-06-27  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

		* tests/release.cxx: Added spin loop in thread1 to allow thread0
		to execute its wait. This is necessary in SMP systems where the
		threads will execute in parallel, but is also benign in single CPU
		systems.

		* tests/mutex2.cxx:
		* tests/mutex3.cxx:
		* tests/sync3.cxx: 
		* tests/thread2.cxx: 
		These tests depend on predicting the behaviour of threads at
		different priorities to pass. In an SMP system, several threads
		will run in parallel, and the execution order will not be as
		expected. These tests are therefore disabled in SMP
		configurations.

		* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx (add_thread): Moved call to
		set_need_reschedule() out of test for empty queue. In SMP systems,
		any addition to a queue may require a reschedule on another CPU.

	2001-06-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

		* include/mlqueue.hxx:
		* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx:
		A major change to the way in which this scheduler works in SMP
		systems. The previous version removed all runnable threads from
		the run queues when they were executing. This resulted in serious
		complications and messy code, particularly when dealing with
		priority changes and timeslicing. The new version keeps running
		threads in the run queues, just like the single-CPU version. The
		main disadvantage of this is that we may have to search past
		threads running on other CPUs before we find one available to run
		on this CPU. However, the pending count array and map mean that we
		only need search one run queue, and in any case the search remains
		bounded by the number of CPUs available.
		Another change is in the way that timeslicing is handled. Now, the
		CPU that takes the clock interrupt decrements the timeslice counts
		for all CPUs and if any go zero, sends a TIMESLICE message to
		that CPU.

		* src/sched/sched.cxx (unlock_inner):
		Removed call to requeue(), no longer needed as a result of
		scheduler reorganization.

		* src/common/thread.cxx:
		Added test in Cyg_Thread::exit() to check that the thread has not
		already been killed. This is only an issue if the thread is
		calling exit() when it is kill()ed from another CPU. The test is
		redundant in single-CPU systems, but it does no harm having it.
		Added code to Cyg_Thread::set_priority() to check for reschedule
		when another thread is being changed in priority.
		Added call in idle thread constructor to scheduler to install the
		idle thread as the default current thread for a CPU.

		* include/smp.hxx:
		Added CYG_KERNEL_CPU_TIMESLICE_INTERRUPT(), did some miscellaneous
		tidying.

		* include/instrmnt.h: Added SMP_RESCHED_SEND and SMP_RESCHED_RECV
		events.

		* cdl/kernel.cdl: Added smp test program.

		* tests/smp.cxx: Added this program to test SMP functionality.

	2001-06-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

		* src/sched/sched.cxx:
		Removed code to set up initial current thread, this is now done
		in the idle thread constructor.
		Added code here to set up interrupts for SMP inter-processor
		interrupts. This is not very tidy and may need to be
		changed in the future.

		* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx:
		Added local set_need_reschedule() function to set the
		need_reschedule flag on a suitable CPU.
		Many more changes to cope with SMP systems.
		NOTE: This code has all become somthing of a mess, it need to be
		tidied up and the SMP-specific changes integrated better into the
		code. Also, timesliceing currently only works on the CPU that
		takes clock interrupts - this needs fixing.

		* src/common/thread.cxx:
		Moved assignment of initial current thread to here from sched.cxx.

		* include/smp.hxx:
		Changed CYG_KERNEL_CPU_INTERRUPT()
		CYG_KERNEL_CPU_RESCHEDULE_INTERRUPT() since there may be other
		interrupt types to worry about.
		Added annotations to scheduler data items.

		* include/sched.hxx:
		Split set_current_thread() into two functions, the original works
		only on the current CPU, the new one sets another CPU's current
		thread. This latter function is only used to prime the current
		threads during initialization.
		Added second need_reschedule() function that takes a thread
		argument. This is intended to be overridden by a scheduler
		specific function that sets the need_reschedule flag if the
		supplied thread is more deserving of CPU time that any current
		thread.

		* include/mlqueue.hxx:
		Made cyg_scheduler_set_need_reschedule() a friend of
		Cyg_Scheduler_Implementation class.
		Added override set_need_reschedule() functions.

		* include/kapidata.h: Added cpu field to cyg_thread structure when
		in SMP systems.

		* include/intr.hxx:
		* src/intr/intr.cxx:
		Added Cyg_Interrupt::set_cpu() and Cyg_Interrupt::get_cpu() for
		SMP systems.

		* include/instrmnt.h: Added events for INTR_GET_CPU and
		INTR_SET_CPU.

	2001-05-29  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

		The following changes were all imported from the SMP branch:

		* tests/tm_basic.cxx:
		Modified to work in SMP configuration - mostly at present by
		ifdeffing out code I didn't want to fix.

		* include/sched.hxx:
		Moved scheduler lock operation into Cyg_Scheduler_SchedLock class.
		Converted current_thread, need_reschedule, and thread_switches
		into CPU indexed arrays. Added member functions to get and set
		these indirectly.
		Added start_cpu() to do per-CPU scheduler startup.

		* include/sched.inl:
		Converted scheduler lock/unlock functions to use new schedlock
		class.

		* src/sched/sched.cxx:
		Changed in line with sched.hxx.
		Added call to requeue() in unlock_inner() to restore current
		thread to run queue if necessary.	
		Moved most of scheduler startup to Cyg_Scheduler::start_cpu().
		Cyg_Scheduler::start() now also starts secondary CPUs in SMP
		systems.
		Added cyg_kernel_smp_startup() as entry point from HAL into kernel
		for secondary CPUs.

		* include/mlqueue.hxx:
		Added Cyg_RunQueue type and removed
		Cyg_SchedulerThreadQueue_Implementation type.
		Converted timeslice_count to CPU indexed array.
		Added requeue() member function to scheduler class.
		Added cpu member to thread implementation class, to record
		thread's current CPU.

		* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx:
		Changed behaviour when in SMP system to remove scheduled thread
		from run queue and replace it when preempted.
		Added some extra asserts, and removed some that are no longer true
		in an SMP system.

		* src/instrmnt/meminst.cxx: In SMP systems: added spinlock to
		protect instrument buffer, added CPU Id in top 4 bits of thread Id
		field.

		* src/common/thread.cxx:
		Converted to use accessor functions for need_reschedule and
		current_thread.
		Rearranged idle thread creation to create one for each CPU.

		* include/test/stackmon.h: Extended to handle stack usage for
		multiple idle threads.

		* include/thread.inl:
		Added some extra instrumentation.

		* include/smp.hxx:
		Added this file to contain all kernel SMP support. The main
		definitions exported by this file are spin lock and scheduler lock
		implementation classes, for both SMP and uniprocessor
		configurations.

		* src/intr/intr.cxx: 
		* include/intr.hxx:
		Converted interrupt disable counter to CPU indexed array. In
		intr.cxx: added lock of scheduler lock in interrupt_end() rather
		than in default interrupt VSR.

		* cdl/kernel.cdl: Added option to enable SMP support.

		* include/instrmnt.h: 
		* cdl/instrument.cdl: Added SMP instrumentation.

	2001-05-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

		* include/intr.hxx:
		* src/intr/intr.cxx: 
		Added default definition of CYGNUM_HAL_ISR_TABLE_SIZE. This is now
		used to declare the chain table so that architectures which have
		different sizes for the interrupt table and vector count will work
		correctly.

	2001-05-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

		* include/sched.hxx (class Cyg_Scheduler_Base):
		Added annotation to sched_lock.

		* cdl/instrument.cdl:
		Rename CYGNUM_KERNEL_INSTRUMENT_BUFFER_WRAP to
		CYGDBG_KERNEL_INSTRUMENT_BUFFER_WRAP as it appears in the code.

2001-07-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/intr/intr.cxx (chain_isr): Return isr_ret so caller (which
	may be an arbiter) can tell if the interrupt was handled.

2001-07-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/common/clock.cxx (dsr): Fix problems mixing signed and
	unsigned values.  Normally only generated warnings, but...

2001-07-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/sched.inl (unlock_reschedule): Fix commenting.
	* src/sched/sched.cxx: Improve description of unlock_inner().

2001-06-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/common/thread.cxx (Cyg_Thread::Cyg_Thread): Initialize
	wakeup_count

2001-06-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/clocktruth.cxx: New file.  A test to get a sanity check on
	whether the clock is accurate to wallclock time, only useful for
	humans to watch really.  But important!

2001-05-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/thread.hxx (class Cyg_HardwareThread): Remove unused
	load_context() method.
	* include/thread.inl: Ditto.

2001-05-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/sched/bitmap.cxx (rem_thread): No need to set need_reschedule...
	rescheduling will happen automatically when the state changes.

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx (add_thread): No need to explicitly clear
	thread->queue.

2001-04-26  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/intr0.cxx: 
	* tests/kintr0.c:
	Fixed these two tests so that they work properly on architectures
	where CYGNUM_HAL_ISR_MIN is not zero. These include the x86 and
	V850.

2001-04-18  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* tests/dhrystone.c:
	Fix the conditional for STDIO_FORMATTED_IO

2001-04-17  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* tests/stress_threads.c (setup_death_alarm):
	Cope with synthetic target reorg

	* tests/except1.cxx, tests/kexcept1.c:
	Reenable for the synthetic target

	* tests/tm_basic.cxx:
	Reenable for the synthetic target

2001-04-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Do cache tests on E7T.

2001-04-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/flag1.cxx: Apply same changes here as were applied to
	kflag1 on 2000-07-17. This allows this test to run to completion
	in slow targets, especially simulators.

	* tests/stress_threads.c: Reduce run time even further in
	simulator runs where instrumentation is enabled.

2001-04-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/dhrystone.c: Fix feature check.

2001-03-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Only need to compile dbg_gdb.cxx with
	CYGDBG_KERNEL_DEBUG_GDB_THREAD_SUPPORT

	* src/debug/dbg_gdb.cxx: Add new dbg_thread_id() function.

2001-02-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/thread.inl (attach_stack): Check for non-NULL stack base.

2001-02-11  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/stress_threads.c: CYGINT_ISO_STDIO_FORMATTED_IO needs a
	#ifdef not an #if.
	* tests/dhrystone.c: Ditto.

2001-02-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/kill.cxx: Increase delay for all targets, just in case some
	are slow.

2001-01-30  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/common/clock.cxx (rem_alarm): Must clear the enabled flag;
	this disappeared in the changes to using clists of 2001-01-09.
	Symptom was that an alarm, once disabled, could never be
	re-attached to its counter because it claimed it already was.
	Plus asserts with multiple disables - "bad counter object".

2001-01-30  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/common/thread.cxx (reinitialize): Following change of
	2000-12-05, if CYGFUN_KERNEL_THREADS_STACK_CHECKING, this was
	using the stack_base/stack_size variables directly to reinitialize
	the stack area.  This was wrong, and leaked store off the top and
	bottom of the stacks because the "buffer zone" was carved off
	repeatedly.  Fix is to use the published APIs which compensate.

2001-01-26  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/mlqueue.hxx: 
	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx:
	Restored Cyg_ThreadQueue_Implementation::remove() since it must
	clear the thread's queue pointer, which the base clist class
	remove() does not.

2001-01-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx (highpri): Fix trace call.

2001-01-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/mlqueue.hxx:
	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx: 
	Converted to use clist.hxx list implementation. The main effect of
	this is to clean up the code and class definitions since much of
	what was part of the thread queue and thread classes now moves to
	the DNode and CList classes.

	* include/clock.hxx:
	* src/common/clock.cxx: 
	Converted to use clist.hxx list implementation. This removes all
	the explicit list manipulation code from the counter and alarm
	classes, resulting in cleaner, easier to understand code.

	* include/kapidata.h: Adjusted cyg_alarm struct to match Cyg_Alarm
	using Cyg_DNode.
	
2000-12-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/thread.inl (check_stack): check word alignment with CYG_WORD
	not cyg_uint32
	Add extra stack checking for when stack limits are used.
	(measure_stack_usage): New function to measure stack usage of the thread
	(attach_stack): check word alignment with CYG_WORD not cyg_uint32
	Initialize stack to preset value when measuring stack usage
	(increment_stack_limit): Conditionalize here wrt 
	CYGFUN_KERNEL_THREADS_STACK_CHECKING and use the version in thread.cxx
	instead if CYGFUN_KERNEL_THREADS_STACK_CHECKING is defined.

	* src/common/thread.cxx (exit): If verbose stack measurement enabled,
	output stack usage
	(increment_stack_limit): Add version of this method when
	CYGFUN_KERNEL_THREADS_STACK_CHECKING *is* defined. This will add
	padding above the stack limit as necessary.

	* include/thread.hxx (class Cyg_HardwareThread): Add
	measure_stack_usage() member

	* cdl/thread.cdl (CYGFUN_KERNEL_THREADS_STACK_MEASUREMENT):
	Add to implement stack usage measurement.

	* include/kapi.h (cyg_thread_measure_stack_usage): New function
	* src/common/kapi.cxx (cyg_thread_measure_stack_usage): New function

2000-12-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/thread.cdl (CYGFUN_KERNEL_ALL_THREADS_STACK_CHECKING): 
	Requires threads list, rather than active_if them so that
	inference engine can do its thang.

2000-12-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/debug/dbg-thread-demux.c: Add comment about the use of
	DBG_SYSCALL_THREAD_VEC_NUM vs CYGNUM_CALL_IF_DBG_SYSCALL.

2000-12-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/thread.inl (attach_stack): Additional assert check for
	unsigned wrap of the stack size in subtracting the signature
	areas' size.  Also round to whole words better.

2000-12-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/thread.cdl (CYGFUN_KERNEL_THREADS_STACK_CHECKING): New
	option, to control new stack check features.  Enabled by default,
	but only active if CYGPKG_INFRA_DEBUG and CYGDBG_USE_ASSERTS
	anyway, plus checking *all* threads is possible, but default off,
	iff CYGVAR_KERNEL_THREADS_LIST.

	* include/thread.hxx (class Cyg_HardwareThread): Define
	check_stack() function.

	* include/thread.inl (attach_stack): Add initialization of a
	signature in the top and base of the stack, if so configured.
	(check_stack): New function to check that signature for
	correctness; minor re-ordering to permit more inlining.

	* src/sched/sched.cxx (unlock_inner): Check departing and incoming
	thread stacks if CYGFUN_KERNEL_THREADS_STACK_CHECKING.  Also, if
	CYGFUN_KERNEL_ALL_THREADS_STACK_CHECKING, check all registered
	thread stacks.  This is placed here to get executed every
	clocktick and other interrupts that call DSRs, rather than messing
	with interrupt_end() or the idle thread.

2000-12-04  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/kcache2.c (entry0): Make this more robust against a
	complete absence of useful caches.  Previous change was not
	careful enough.

2000-12-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Build the kcache tests for SA11x0 family; they
	were being omitted by default as part of ARM family.  They work on
	SA1110, so this should be OK.  They're OK on EBSAs too.  See
	associated fix to cache macros in SA11x0 and EBSSA HALs.

	* tests/kcache2.c (entry0): Fix the test; the problem was it
	assumed that a write to a previously unseen location would end up
	in the cache.  It ain't so on StrongARMs.  Also make tests safe
	wrt interrupts possibly perturbing the cache, add explicit tests
	for HAL_DCACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL(), ...DISABLE() and ...SYNC(), and
	improve the tests for cache line invalidate and store.

2000-10-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/synch.cdl: Replaced CYGINT_KERNEL_SCHEDULER_CAN_YIELD with
	CYGINT_KERNEL_SCHEDULER_UNIQUE_PRIORITIES.
	* cdl/scheduler.cdl:
	CYGSEM_KERNEL_SYNCH_MUTEX_PRIORITY_INVERSION_PROTOCOL requires
	CYGINT_KERNEL_SCHEDULER_UNIQUE_PRIORITIES.

	* tests/thread2.cxx: Use new option.
	* tests/klock.c: Same.
	* src/common/thread.cxx: Same.
	* src/common/clock.cxx: Same.

	* include/bitmap.hxx: Leave unique priority setting to CDL.
	* include/mlqueue.hxx: Same.
	* include/sched.hxx: Let CDL do sanity check of config.

2000-10-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/scheduler.cdl: Added CYGINT_KERNEL_SCHEDULER_CAN_YIELD

	* tests/klock.c: Avoid use of disabled features. Require scheduler
	that can yield.

	* include/intr.hxx (class Cyg_Interrupt): Make dsr_count volatile
	to prevent a potential race condition with overzealous C
	compilers.

2000-10-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sched/sched.cxx (unlock_inner): Added condition to test for
	DSRs to only call DSRs when the scheduler lock is making a 0->1
	transition. Otherwise there is the danger of calling DSRs when the
	scheduler lock is > 1. This violates our original assumptions
	about how the scheduler lock worked with respect to DSR. 

	* src/intr/intr.cxx (call_pending_DSRs): Added assert to check
	that DSRs are only called when the scheduler lock is exactly 1.

2000-10-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/intr.hxx: Fixing syntax mistake; volatile keyword must
	appear after the type for it to affect the pointer variable.
	* src/intr/intr.cxx: Same. Remove volatile from local block.

2000-10-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/intr/intr.cxx: Made dsr_table_tail volatile as well.
	* include/intr.hxx: Ditto.

2000-10-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sched/sched.cxx: 
	* include/sched.hxx: Converted asr_inhibit from a bool to a
	counter. This is necessary to permit nesting of ASR inhibiting
	functions.

2000-10-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/intr.hxx: Made dsr_list volatile.
	* src/intr/intr.cxx: Same. Also fix compiler warning.

2000-09-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx:
	Added test for current thread not runnable in
	Cyg_Scheduler_Implementation::timeslice().  This is possible if a
	prior DSR has caused the current thread to be descheduled. Added
	an assert to Cyg_ThreadQueue_Implementation::rotate() for
	additional paranoia. (This problem was originally identified and
	fixed (differently) by Andrew Lunn <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>.)

2000-09-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/kexcept1.c (cause_exception): Use separate cause_fpe function.
	* tests/except1.cxx (cause_exception): Same.

	* tests/kexcept1.c (cause_exception): Do not use division at all.
	* tests/except1.cxx (cause_exception): Same.

	* tests/kexcept1.c (cause_exception): Do not cause div-by-zero.

2000-09-11  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/instrument.cdl (CYGVAR_KERNEL_INSTRUMENT_EXTERNAL_BUFFER): 
	Bring this option back from the dead

2000-09-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/sched.hxx:
	* include/sched.inl:
	Added Cyg_Scheduler::unlock_reschedule() function. This decrements
	the scheduler lock by one but also permits the current thread to
	be rescheduled if it ready to sleep, or there is a higher priority
	thread ready to run. This is to support use of various
	synchronization objects while the scheduler lock is claimed.

	* src/sched/sched.cxx (unlock_inner): Modified precondition to
	allow for functionality of unlock_reschedule().

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx:
	Now uses Cyg_SchedulerThreadQueue_Implementation for all runqueue
	pointers. It was using Cyg_ThreadQueue_Implementation in some
	places which meant we were trying to sort the run queues!
	Changed yield() so it can be called with the scheduler lock
	claimed.
	Changed Cyg_Scheduler_Implementation::timeslice() to rotate the
	queue itself rather than call yield(). The changes to yield() make
	it unsafe to call here any more.

	* include/mlqueue.hxx (class Cyg_SchedulerThreadQueue_Implementation): 
	Made enqueue() member public.
	
	* include/mboxt2.inl:
	* src/common/thread.cxx: 
	* src/sync/mutex.cxx: 
	* src/sync/cnt_sem2.cxx: 
	Removed assertions for zero scheduler lock and replaced some
	invocations of Cyg_Scheduler::unlock() with
	Cyg_Scheduler::unlock_reschedule() or Cyg_Scheduler::reschedule()
	where appropriate.

	* tests/klock.c:
	* cdl/kernel.cdl:
	Added klock.c to test functionality while scheduler lock is claimed.

2000-08-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sched/sched.cxx (unlock_inner): Move an assert to some place
	where it's true *all* the time!  There was a narrow margin where a
	DSR could confuse unlock_inner() by reanimating the current thread
	before it had a chance to sleep - hence the call appears to be
	pointless.  Putting the assert before the DSR calls makes sense.

	* include/mboxt.inl:
	* src/sync/bin_sem.cxx:
	* src/sync/cnt_sem.cxx:
	* src/sync/flag.cxx:
	* src/sync/mutex.cxx:
	All of these now use Cyg_Scheduler::reschedule() rather than an
	unlock/lock pair to yield in their functions which can sleep.
	They therefore can be called safely and atomically with the
	scheduler already locked.  This is a Good Thing[tm].  Since the
	network stack synch primitives now use this feature, the asserts
	that the scheduler was not locked must disappear: this change.


2000-08-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/mutex.hxx (class Cyg_Mutex): Add comment explaining
	presence of locked.

2000-08-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/stress_threads.c (STACK_SIZE_HANDLER): Increase stack sizes
	otherwise it crashes!

2000-07-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/mempolt2.hxx: As per change of 2000-07-04, also delete - left
	behind accidentally

2000-07-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/mutex.hxx (class Cyg_Mutex): Added get_ceiling()
	accessor function.

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx: Fixed bug in sorted queue code that
	resulted in an infinite loop if the thread being inserted is of
	lower priority than all threads in the queue. This case is now
	detected early.

2000-07-17  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* tests/kflag1.c (FIRST_THREAD_WAIT_TIME): Parameterize thread 
	synchronization wait times (for understanding) and adjust for
	incredibly slow platforms.  [Previous value allowed for the test
	to get out of sync because the code ran so slowly]

2000-07-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Remove all configury related to memory allocators,
	including tests. Make CYGFUN_KERNEL_API_C require CYGFUN_MEMALLOC_KAPI

	* include/memfixed.hxx, include/mempolt2.inl, include/mempoolt.hxx,
	  include/mempoolt.inl, include/memvar.hxx, include/mfiximpl.hxx,
	  include/mfiximpl.inl, include/mvarimpl.hxx, include/mvarimpl.inl,

	Move to separate memory allocator package CYGPKG_MEMALLOC
	
	* include/kapi.h, include/kapidata.h, src/common/kapi.cxx:
	Remove memory allocator functionality - now implemented in
	CYGPKG_MEMALLOC

	* tests/dhrystone.c:
	Update configuration dependencies for new isoinfra design
	* tests/stress_threads.c:
	Likewise.
	Also fix early termination after DEATH_TIME_LIMIT so that 
	allocated resources are freed, and so more appropriate
	statistics are reported
	Also update to use mallinfo() interface to memory allocator

2000-06-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/kapi.h (cyg_scheduler_read_lock): New function, to
	return the value of the scheduler lock; this for implementing SPLX
	in the network stack.

	* src/common/kapi.cxx (cyg_scheduler_read_lock): New function.

2000-06-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx (Cyg_ThreadQueue_Implementation::enqueue):
	Rewrote code to insert threads into priority sorted queue. The
	original code could not cope with a queue all of whose members
	were lower priority than the new thread - it looped for ever. Also
	provided fast paths for common and easily detected cases such as
	adding to a single element queue and adding at the front. By
	taking these cases out early, we can also simplify the code to
	search the queue.

2000-06-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Remove exception tests for CMA230 - not supported
	by hardware.

2000-06-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/intr/intr.cxx (chain_isr): Only call default_isr if no isrs
	in the chain reacted to the interrupt.

2000-06-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/mutex.hxx (class Cyg_Condition_Variable): Added an
	inline function, get_queue(), to return a pointer to the
	underlying thread queue. To be used mainly for comparing with a
	thread's current queue to decide whether it is waiting for a
	condition variable.

	* include/kapi.h:
	* src/common/kapi.cxx: 
	Changed return type of cyg_semaphore_wait() to match existing
	behaviour of Cyg_Counting_Semaphore::wait().
	Changed return type of cyg_cond_wait() to match new behaviour of
	Cyg_Condition_Variable::wait().

2000-06-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/mutex.hxx:
	* src/sync/mutex.cxx:
	Modified non-timeout condition variable wait() API to return
	cyg_bool. A true result indicates that the wait() terminated
	normally. A false result indicates that the wait() was terminated
	as a result of a release() or destroy operation. For most uses
	this distinction is irrelevant, but in some situations it is a
	useful bit of information to have.
	Also modified timeout condition variable wait to reacquire the
	mutex under all circumstances. This is the correct and consistent
	thing to do.

2000-06-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/debug/dbg-thread-demux.c: Use generic HAL feature to allow
	ROM/RAM intercalling.

2000-06-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/kcache1.c (entry0): Skip invalidate tests on TX49. Too slow.

2000-05-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* tests/dhrystone.c: Increase number of test loops for faster
	StrongARM platforms.

2000-05-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/scheduler.cdl (CYGIMP_KERNEL_SCHED_SORTED_QUEUES): Disable by
	default

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx (enqueue): Add to end of thread queue even
	when not priority ordered

2000-05-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/mqueue.hxx, include/mqueue.inl:
	Add POSIX-style message queue implementation
	
	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Add mqueue1 test
	* cdl/scheduler.cdl: Add new CYGIMP_KERNEL_SCHED_SORTED_QUEUES option

	* include/sema.hxx: Need thread.inl header, not just thread.hxx
	Make Cyg_Counting_Semaphore::peek() const since it is

	* src/sync/cnt_sem.cxx, src/sync/cnt_sem2.cxx, include/sema2.hxx:
	Make Cyg_Counting_Semaphore{2}::peek() const since it is

	* include/thread.hxx: don't want Cyg_Thread_queue::empty() to be marked
	inline in the class def, otherwise we get warnings elsewhere

	* include/mlqueue.hxx (Cyg_ThreadQueue_Implementation):
	Add set_thread_queue private method
	Add derived class Cyg_SchedulerThreadQueue_Implementation, and
	make scheduler implementation use it instead of
	Cyg_ThreadQueue_Implementation
	
	* src/mlqueue.cxx: Fix typo
	Support  CYGIMP_KERNEL_SCHED_SORTED_QUEUES, i.e. allow insertion
	into thread queue in order of thread priority, with oldest at the
	front
	(Cyg_ThreadQueue_Implementation::set_thread_queue): Add
	(Cyg_SchedulerThreadQueue_Implementation::enqueue): Add, like old
	one, except make it FIFO instead of LIFO by inserting at end of queue

2000-05-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/dhrystone.c: More loops on the TX49

2000-05-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/counters.cdl (CYGVAR_KERNEL_COUNTERS_CLOCK_DSR_LATENCY): 
	Default to CYGVAR_KERNEL_COUNTERS_CLOCK_LATENCY

2000-05-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/instrmnt.h: Remove all CYG_UNUSED_PARAMs as they could
	cause problems when used with volatile arguments
	* src/intr/intr.cxx: Use CYG_UNUSED_PARAM to silence warning that
	appears because of the above change.

2000-05-02  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* tests/kintr0.c:
	* tests/intr0.cxx: Correct test for cases when VSR_MIN or
	ISR_MIN are not zero (bad assumption).

2000-05-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/thread.cdl (CYGNUM_KERNEL_THREADS_DATA_LIBC): Don't need libc
	slot. Replace with CYGNUM_KERNEL_THREADS_DATA_ERRNO slot instead.	

2000-04-28  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sched/sched.cxx (unlock_inner):
	A significant change to the behaviour of this function.  The
	new_lock argument contains the value that the scheduler lock
	should have after this function has completed. If it is zero then
	the lock is being released and some extra work (running ASRs,
	checking for DSRs) is done before returning. If it is non-zero
	then it must equal the current value of the lock, and is used to
	indicate that we want to reacquire the scheduler lock before
	returning. This latter option only makes any sense if the current
	thread is no longer runnable, otherwise this function will do
	nothing.

	The result of this is that where we used to "blip" the scheduler
	lock to force a sleep, we now call reschedule(), which calls
	unlock_inner() with the current sched_lock value. The important
	difference is that there is not now the brief window between the
	calls where the lock is unclaimed. It also prevents ASRs being run
	at inopportune moments. In future this will also allow us to force
	threads to sleep even when they are deeply nested in the scheduler
	lock.

	* include/mutex.hxx:
	Added Cyg_Mutex::get_owner() to return pointer to owning thread.
	
	* include/sched.hxx:
	* include/sched.inl:	
	Added new_lock argument to unlock_inner(), added reschedule().
	Made set_asr_inhibit() and clear_asr_inhibit() available even when
	ASRs are disabled.

	* include/mboxt.inl:
	* src/sync/bin_sem.cxx: 
	* src/sync/cnt_sem.cxx:
	* src/sync/flag.cxx: 
	* src/sync/mutex.cxx: 
	Converted instances of "blipping" the scheduler lock into calls to
	Cyg_Scheduler::reschedule(), which is better behaved. Some calls
	to set_asr_inhibit() and clear_asr_inhibit() also added in various
	places.

2000-04-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/kcache1.c: Also to flush testing with unified caches.

	inheritance - or not - in a multiple thread manner, depending only
	on delays and the clock, so it tests that scheduling does the
	right thing, rather than simply checking reported priorities.

	* include/pkgconf/kernel.h: New config option added,
	(CYGSEM_KERNEL_SYNCH_MUTEX_PRIORITY_INHERITANCE_SIMPLE_RELAY).
	It is a child of ..._PRIORITY_INHERITANCE_SIMPLE and is really
	only there to turn off if you really want the old implementation.

	* src/sync/mutex.cxx (unlock): Add call to
	Cyg_SchedThread::relay_priority() when relinquishing the mutex, in
	order to relay any raised priority to the new owner.  Also count
	the mutex we are waiting for as well as those held for correct
	recovery in the case of inheriting priority then being killed, for
	example.

	* include/sched.hxx (class Cyg_SchedThread::relay_priority): New

	member function to implement pass-it-on or "discovered ceiling"
	priority inheritance extension to the simple algorithm.  Also use
	get_current_priority() in Cyg_SchedThread::inherit_priority() to
	let this work.

2000-01-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/clock.hxx (class Cyg_Counter::counter): make the counter

	many times" bug.

1999-11-24  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	destroying, given the change below.

	* src/common/kapi.cxx (cyg_cond_destroy): Call the correct
	destructor.  As it happens, it didn't matter because all these
	destructors do is assert the queue is empty, and the queue is the
	2nd word in every case.
	(cyg_mutex_destroy): Call the destructor at all, so that
	assertions are made.

1999-09-13  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/intr/intr.cxx (call_pending_DSRs_inner): Add assert to check

	cyg_test_is_simulator for last two tests. Otherwise they take far
	too long and time out.

1999-08-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/intr0.cxx (vsr0): 
	* tests/kintr0.c (vsr0): 
	Add a comment to the effect that vsr0() is NOT a valid VSR on any
	known platform; VSRs must be writ in assembler.  Customer
	requested this, the examples are rather confusing otherwise.

1999-08-23  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/kernel.h:
	* src/common/clock.cxx:
	* tests/tm_basic.cxx:
	Added CYGVAR_KERNEL_COUNTERS_CLOCK_DSR_LATENCY to enable recording
	of DSR latency figures. Added code controlled by this option to
	clock and tm_basic. Also made interrupt latency measurement
	primarily dependent on CYGVAR_KERNEL_COUNTERS_CLOCK_LATENCY since
	whether HAL_CLOCK_LATENCY is defined is not sufficient.

1999-08-17  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/counters.cdl, cdl/interrupts.cdl, cdl/scheduler.cdl:

	Implement radio buttons using "FIXME radio" hack in

1999-07-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sync/mutex.cxx (lock): Added simple assertion check for

	* tests/kcache1.c (entry0): Also perform timing tests with
	HAL_DCACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL and/or HAL_ICACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL in the
	loop if provided by the HAL.  Invalidating the Data cache can
	spoil clock operation, so elapsed time appears to be 0.

	* tests/kcache2.c (entry0): Replace the "if (0)" for having a
	copy-back cache with a proper test on a HAL macro.  Even though I
	couldn't actually get those parts of the test to work on the
	platform I'm currently working on.

	* include/stackmon.hxx: new file, to ease printing stuff about
	stack usage, particularly of interrupt stacks and the idle
	thread.  It's not HAL specific, and it can apply to tests outside
	of the kernel, which is why it's in a public include-place.

	* src/common/thread.cxx (kill): Only perform the state-changes
	implied by kill if the thread has not already been killed;
	otherwise two kill()'s will remove a thread unconditionally,
	whether it's in the middle of a wait that needs tidying up or not.
	In other words, ensure idempotency.

	Ditto set_timer().
	Changed a "clear_timer()" call to "timer.disable()" and added one
	so that they affect _this_ thread, the thread which is being
	kill()ed or reinitialize()d rather than the killer or the
	resuscitator.  Otherwise the alarm list can still get a loop in
	it when a thread's killed when waiting with a timeout and
	restarted soon enough.
	
1998-10-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	In general, these changes are to support create/delete of uITRON
	objects; this requires that an object can be destroyed whilst
	there are threads waiting on it, and that they shall be awoken
	with a specific return code.

	* include/thread.hxx:
	Cyg_Thread::DESTRUCT added to wake reasons, to deal with an object
	being destroyed whilst a thread is waiting on it; it's handled in
	a manner very similar to release() and BREAK wake_reason.
	
	* src/common/thread.cxx: 
	thread_entry(): threads now exit() if the entry_point returns.
	Cyg_Thread() constructors now initialize wake_reason to NONE.
	reinitialize() clears any pending timeout before calling
	constructors.
	counted_sleep( [timeout] ) now both deal with the wake reason in
	general, and with DESTRUCT in particular.
	exit() now clears any pending timeout.
	kill() now force_resumes the thread first.
	kill() now does not explicitly remove the thread from any queue
	it's on; wake() does that for you anyway.
	delay() clears the timer just in case and handles DESTRUCT
	properly.
	DESTRUCT added to various switches for completeness.

	The fixes to counted_sleep()[x2] and kill() are a bugfix for
	PR#17688.

	* include/flag.hxx:
	* src/sync/flag.cxx:
	Add an argument, defaulting to 0, to the constructor which sets
	the initial flag value.
	Add handing of DESTRUCT wake reason.
	Add a destructor which wakes all threads with DESTRUCT
	wake_reason.

	The GDB thread support requires the kernel to keep track of all
	threads on a linked list. This is a separate option. An additional
	requires statement enforces the dependency.
	
1998-09-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/debug/dbg-thread-demux.c:

1998-09-24  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/debug/dbg-thread-demux.c (dbg_thread_syscall_rmt):
	PR 17327. If kernel gdb thread support is disabled, do not compile
	in the relevant cases in the rmt switch statement. This is a
	partial solution to the general problem of how the HAL, kernel,
	cygmon, and gdb interact.

1998-09-24  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/common/clock.cxx (Cyg_RealTimeClock):
	Changed clock priority from zero to one, since it is now used to
	set the hardware interrupt priority.

	* src/intr/intr.cxx:
	Cyg_Interrupt::chain_isr() now only calls interrupt objects that
	have the matching vector number.
	Call HAL_INTERRUPT_SET_LEVEL() when attaching interrupts using the
	priority passed in the constructor.
	Added call to HAL_TRANSLATE_VECTOR() for attaching chained
	interrupts.

	PR#17182
	Move the code to synchronize a repeating alarm which had been
 	firing in the dim and distant past with times in the future, which
 	had been inline in Cyg_Alarm::enable(), into a function of its
 	own, Cyg_Alarm::synchronize().  Call it from Cyg_Alarm::enable()
	and also from add_alarm() when the immediate time to fire is now
	or in the past; otherwise an initial time of, say, NOW-10 with an
	interval of 5 would just get lost.  Also corrected/commented the

	This is required for the C library realloc() implementation. Strictly
