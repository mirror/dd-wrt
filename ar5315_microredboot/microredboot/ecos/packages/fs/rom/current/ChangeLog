2004-10-04  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/romfs.c (romfs_mount): Avoid a compiler warning about punned
	types.

2004-08-08  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/romfs.cdl: generate both little-endian and big-endian image
	files.

	* tests/fileio1.c: include either a little-endian or a big-endian
	image. Totally fail the test early on if the file system cannot be
	mounted.

2004-06-14  John Dallaway  <jld@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/romfs.cdl: Specify the test executable file name for
	compatibility with the eCos Configuration Tool.

2004-02-20  Vincent Catros  <Vincent.Catros@elios-informatique.fr>

	* src/fs-ecos.c :
	(jffs2_find) Policy to skip path separator is no longer
	"if '/' then skip" but "while '/' then skip" allowing
	multi '/' separators (i.e : /tmp////foo).
	(find_entry) Policy to detect end of path is no longer
	"if '\0' then end_of_path"
	but "while '/' skip it and then if '\0' then end_of_path"
	allowing path terminated with any number of '/'
	(i.e : chdir(/tmp///)).

2003-12-11  Sandeep Kumar <sandeep@codito.com>

	* src/romfs.c (romfs_mount) : function wrongly returns ENOENT even
	if fste->data isn't NULL.

2003-09-25  Oyvind Harboe <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

	* src/romfs.c (romfs_mount): If a mount fails, make sure we leave
	all state information in such a way we can try again.

2003-07-10  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>
        
	* support/mk_romfs.c: S_I[RWX]{USR|GRP|OTH} etc changed to match
	the changes in sys/stat.h

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/romfs.cdl: Fix doc link.

2003-01-30  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/romfs.cdl: Implements the CYGINT_IO_FILEIO_FS interface.

2003-01-29  John Dallaway  <jld@ecoscentric.com>

	* support/file2c.tcl: Accommodate latest Cygwin Tcl shell
	(tclsh83.exe)

2002-04-15  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* support/file2c.tcl:
	Do not use an alignment attribute, since it is not honoured on
	all targets.
	
	* src/romfs.c:
	Remove alignment restrictions, since they are not actually needed
	yet and alignment is hard to guarantee on all targets.

2002-01-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* support/mk_romfs.c: Open image file in binary mode (for cygwin).
	Spotted by Warren Jasper.

2001-11-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/romfs.cdl (CYGTST_ROMFS_BUILD_TESTS): Try gcc and cc if $HOST_CC
	doesn't exist or has a problem.

2001-11-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/romfs.cdl: Use HOST_CC instead of 'cc'.

2001-10-17  Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@redhat.com>
2001-10-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* support/mk_romfs.c: Open input files in binary mode (for cygwin).
	* cdl/romfs.cdl: Work around cygwin path problems by copying files
	into build tree.

2001-07-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/fileio1.c (main): Get this to actually pass! Remove
	kernel dependency.
	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Get CDL dependencies better. Don't use
	fixed base address. Make test building an option. Build mk_romfs
	and use it to construct a test romfs.
	* support/mk_romfs.c: fix trivial typo
	* tests/testromfs: Directory hierarchy added for constructing test
	ROMFS.

2001-07-13  Richard Panton (richard.panton@3glab.com)

	* support/mk_romfs.c: Convert between host FS file modes and eCos
	ones.

2000-10-25  Richard Panton (richard.panton@3glab.com)

	* cdl/romfs.cdl:
	* src/romfs.c:
	* support/mk_romfs.c:
	* tests/fileio1.c:
	A sample ROM filesystem implementation
