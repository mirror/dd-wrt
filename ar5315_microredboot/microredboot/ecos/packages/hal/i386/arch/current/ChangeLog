2003-01-31  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_syscall.c (hal_syscall_handler): Let generic syscall code
	handle exit.

2002-11-28  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Added GRUB startup option to tests for IDT
	initialization. Added call to breakpoint() before cyg_start(),
	controlled by CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INITIAL_BREAK.

2002-05-17  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Rearranged interrupt stack definitions to make it
	work correctly in SMP case. The #ifdefs were improperly nested.

2002-04-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S:
	Don't use .file as it can confuse debugging since the .file
	doesn't contain the path and therefore the debugger will never
	know where it lives! This conflicts with using -Wa,--gstabs.

2002-04-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_syscall.c (hal_syscall_handler): Add extra sig argument to
	__do_syscall.

2002-01-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h:
	Removed consideration of lazy FPU context switching in determining
	the size of CYGNUM_HAL_STACK_CONTEXT_SIZE, since it does not
	actually make any difference - and previously resulted in too
	small a value for CYGNUM_HAL_STACK_SIZE_MINIMUM.

2002-01-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (__fpu_switch_vsr): Fixed register usage bug.

2001-10-01  Ian Campbell  <icampbell@arcom.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: include CYGBLD_HAL_PLATFORM_H rather than
	<pkgconf/hal_i386_pc.h>

2001-09-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (__default_interrupt_vsr): Adjust saved stack pointer
	for the hardware and trampoline saved data.
	(__default_exception_vsr): Ditto.

	* include/arch.inc: Clean up typo in stack switching macros.

2001-08-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_io.h: Added some macros to do in-memory data
	accesses for memory mapped devices.

	* include/hal_arch.h: Attempted to make some sense out of the
	stack size macros.

	* include/hal_intr.h: Extended VSR table to its full 256 entries.

	* src/vectors.S: Lots of changes to incorporate SMP support.

	* src/i386.ld: Added SMP related data, that must be shared between
	RedBoot and applications, for example.

	* include/hal_smp.h: Added this file to define SMP related HAL
	interfaces.

	* include/arch.inc: Added SMP support. This includes explicit SMP
	macros and stack-switching macros that have single CPU and SMP
	variants. Some SMP modifications to the lazy FPU switching code
	leave it functional in the single CPU case, but do not yet work in
	the SMP case. Lazy FPU switching is currently disabled for SMP in
	the CDL.

	* cdl/hal_i386.cdl: Added SMP configury.

2001-07-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c: Fix "implicit decl of diag_printf" warning.

2001-07-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/arch.inc:
	Added code to clear CR0:TS bit in hal_fpu_init macro. If this bit
	is not clear, then the following finit might trap, and we don't
	want that.
	Added a compare to hal_fpu_push_exc macro for a zero fpu state
	owner. The code was assuming the move set the condition codes,
	which it doesn't.

2001-07-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h (HAL_THREAD_INIT_FPU_CONTEXT): Fix indirection to
	fpucontext members.

2001-07-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h (HAL_RESTORE_INTERRUPTS): Don't change name
	for clobbers.

2001-07-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Be pedantic about register constraint syntax
	to satisfy newer compilers
	* include/hal_io.h: Ditto

2001-06-13  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_i386.cdl: Default to enabling FPU support since gcc assumes
	a hardware FPU anyway. Also default to lazy FPU switching since
	this is cheapest in the modal case.

2001-05-01  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]	
	* src/context.S: Fixed bug in hal_setjmp() that corrupted EBX.

2001-04-26  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* include/hal_intr.h:
	Tidied up mapping of exceptions to vectors. Added implementation
	of HAL_VSR_SET_TO_ECOS_HANDLER().

2001-04-19  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/vectors.S (__default_exception_vsr):
	Disabled ROM monitor stack switching here. There are problems with
	this that I do not have time to worry about now. 

2001-03-30  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/romboot.S: Added code to call video BIOS to initialize
	display.

	* src/vectors.S: Added code to copy data section from ROM to RAM
	in ROM booted systems.

2001-03-16  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/romboot.S:
	* src/romboot.ld:
	Added these files to build 256 byte realmode bootstrap at the top
	of ROM.
	(This is work in progress and is not yet complete.)
	
	* cdl/hal_i386.cdl:
	Added options for building a bootstrap ROM.
	(This is work in progress and is not yet complete.)
	
	* include/basetype.h:
	Returned alignment to 32 bytes, now that I have discovered, the
	hard way, why it was that value in the first place.

	* src/i386.ld: Force alignment of tables to 32 bytes.

	* include/hal_arch.h (HAL_THREAD_INIT_FPU_CONTEXT_SPACE): Fixed
	compiler warning.

2001-03-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/vectors.S:
	Removed memory size stuff.
	Moved BSS zero code here to avoid doing a procedure call. The
	interrupt stack is in the BSS so zeroing it would blow the return
	address away.
	Moved interrupt stack to BSS.

	* src/hal_misc.c: Removed hal_zero_bss(), hal_lsbit_index() and
	hal_msbit_index() functions.

	* include/hal_arch.h:
	Replaced hal_[lm]sbit_index() functions with inline assembler
	using the bsf and bsr instructions.
	Added support for dynamic memory size finder.	

	* cdl/hal_i386.cdl:
	Added interface CYGINT_HAL_I386_MEM_REAL_REGION_TOP.

2001-03-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/vectors.S: Enabled FPU support.
	Added FPU state save and restore macros to default exception and
	interrupt VSRs.
	Added __fpu_switch_vsr to perform lazy context switch of FPU
	state.
	Made use of i386reg_xxx definitions.

	* src/context.S: Added FPU save and restore macros to thread
	switch code. Made use of i386reg_xxx definitions.

	* include/hal_arch.h: Added HAL_FPU_Context structure to contain
	FPU state. Added code to HAL_THREAD_INIT_CONTEXT() to create
	FPU context.

	* include/i386.inc: Updated savestate format in line with hal_arch.h

	* include/arch.inc: Added macros to implement FPU initialization,
	save and restore for threads, exceptions and interrupts.

	* cdl/hal_i386.cdl: Added initial FPU configuration options.

2001-03-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/vectors.S:
	Added support for use of interrupt stack, together with support
	for running DSRs on it.
	Added instrumentation support to default interrupt VSR.
	Miscellaneous tidies to code and comments.

	* src/context.S:
	Rewrote context switch code to permit preservation of the
	interrupt disable state of a thread. This is to support use of an
	interrupt stack, calling DSRs on it and brings the i386 HAL in
	line with other HALs.

	* include/hal_intr.h:
	Added HAL_INTERRUPT_STACK_CALL_PENDING_DSRS(),
	HAL_INTERRUPT_STACK_BASE and HAL_INTERRUPT_STACK_TOP.

	* include/i386.inc: 
	* include/hal_arch.h:
	* src/i386_stub.c:
	Changed naming of last two HAL_SavedRegisters fields.
	Modified HAL_THREAD_INIT_CONTEXT() to match new context switch
	code.

2001-03-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/vectors.S: Eliminated some unnecessary code. Tidied up some
	comments.

	* include/hal_intr.h:
	Moved common exception vector definitions here.
	Moved CPU interrupt enable/disable macros here.
	
	* include/hal_arch.h:
	* src/i386_stub.c: 
	Converted arguments to hal_[g|s]et_gdb_registers() to CYG_ADDRWORD
	from target_register_t.

	* include/arch.inc:
	Moved FPU control stuff here - this still needs a lot of work to
	get running.
	Moved A20 gate enable macro here. Since the A20 gate stuff is part
	of all recent CPUs, this has become an architectural feature.

2001-03-06  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]	
	* include/hal_arch.h: Added CYGARC_CACHED_ADDRESS() and friends.

2001-03-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]	
	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_arch_default_isr): Restored diag_printf() in
	here. Without the reference, RedBoot does not include anything
	from infra/diag.cxx, does not call HAL_DIAG_INIT() and will not
	mangle diagnostic output. 

2001-03-02  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	Some of these changes here were initially made by Fabrice Gautier
	and then liberally modified by me.
	
	* src/vectors.S:
	Removed Synthetic target support - this is moving to its own HAL.
	Added __default_exception_vsr to capture exceptions.
	Renamed hal_pc_generic_interrupt to __default_interrupt_vsr in
	line with other HALs. Generally tidied and polished.
	Added VSR entry trampolines.
	Added interrupt stack definition.

	* src/i386_stub.c: Removed a lot of unnecessary stuff.

	* src/i386.ld: Added absolute defines for IDT, VSR and virtual
	vector tables.

	* src/hal_misc.c: Tidied up and added eCos exception support.

	* src/context.S:
	Modified to save and restore context in new format.

	handling macros.

	* include/hal_arch.h: 
	* include/i386.inc:
	Redfined HAL_SavedRegisters structure and init macro. Now all
	contexts consist of a full register set, vector number, and
	PC,CS,EFLAGS as pushed by the hardware.

	* include/basetype.h: Changed alignment to 4 bytes.

2000-11-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (hal_pc_irq): Use correct register for ISR return value
	when calling interrupt_end()
	Thanks to Phil Hinton for reporting.

2000-10-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (_start): call constructors after initializing
	stub so that they can be debugged. Reported to work okay
	by Fabrice Gautier.

2000-09-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/basetype.h: Use 32-byte alignment

2000-08-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	underscore to _breakinst.

	* src/i386.ld: Switched to new table definition mechanism.
