	* include/pcmb_io.h: IDE init needs to return number of controllers found.

2003-07-23  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* include/pcmb_serial.h: Fixed bogus test on
	CYGSEM_HAL_I386_PCMB_SCREEN_SUPPORT defined to test
	CYGINT_HAL_I386_PCMB_SCREEN_SUPPORT > 0 instead.

2003-07-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pcmb.cdl:
        Changed values for CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_NUMERATOR,
        CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_DENOMINATOR and CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_PERIOD to
        "default_value" from "calculated". This makes it easier
        to change these values globally.

	* cdl/hal_i386_pcmb.cdl: 
	* include/pcmb_io.h: Increase PCI space to include all possible
	busses, slots, etc.  Required because defaults are often too small.	
2002-04-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/pcmb_misc.c (hal_pcmb_init): Disable NMI at this point since
	no real handlers are in place to handle it.  This fixes a problem
	with manual reset code for IDE drivers which can cause NMI.

2002-04-26  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* support/gfxmode.c:
	A utility to find out what graphics modes are available on any
	given PC.

	* include/pcmb.inc:
	Change the graphics mode during RedBoot startup, when configured
	to do so.	

	* cdl/hal_i386_pcmb.cdl:
	Add new configuration option for changing the graphics mode
	during RedBoot startup.

2001-12-06  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/pcmb_serial.h: 
	* src/pcmb_serial.c:
	Added a simple validation test for serial devices. If the status
	register reads back all ones we decide that the device is absent
	and mark it invalid. We test this elsewhere to avoid touching the
	device again. This should help to cope with various problems with
	PCs that come with only one serial port.

2001-11-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/pcmb_screen.c: Restore sensible num lock behaviour after the
	last change.
	(KBScanTable): Fix scan table size.

2001-11-29 Trenton D. Adams  <tadams@theone.dnsalias.com>

	* src/pcmb_screen.c: Support numeric keypad and ctrl-alt-del for
	rebooting.

2001-11-23  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/pcmb_io.h (PC_WRITE_SCREEN): Wrap positions beyond end
	of screen back to start.
	
2001-11-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/pcmb_misc.c (hal_pcmb_init): Fix typo:
	CYGPKG_HAL_I386_PCMB_HAL_MEMSIZE_BIOS -> 
	CYGPKG_HAL_I386_PCMB_MEMSIZE_BIOS

2001-10-19  Ian Campbell  <icampbell@arcom.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pcmb.cdl: Add cdl_options for
	CYGPKG_HAL_I386_PCMB_MEMSIZE to allow configuration of how memory
	is detected. Change CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_PERIOD to use default_value
	rather than calculated (so it can be overridden in the platform).
	* src/pcmb_misc.c: Implement CYGPKG_HAL_I386_PCMB_MEMSIZE
	configuration options.
	
2001-10-16  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/pcmb_serial.c (cyg_hal_plf_serial_init): Use CDL to determine
	how many serial ports to support.
	* src/pcmb_screen.c (cyg_hal_plf_screen_init): Use CDL to determine
	channel number for keyboard/screen.

2001-10-01  Ian Campbell  <icampbell@arcom.co.uk>

	* include/pcmb_io.h: Include CYGBLD_HAL_PLATFORM_H rather than
	<pkgconf/hal_i386_pc.h>. Also include <pkgconf/system.h> so the
	define is available.

2001-09-14  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* include/pcmb_io.h (HAL_IDE_READ_ALTSTATUS): Add 2 for correct offset.
	(HAL_IDE_WRITE_CONTROL): Ditto.

2001-08-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/pcmb_misc.c: Added spinlock to clock read operation.
	
	* include/pcmb_io.h (PC_WRITE_SCREEN_*): Added casts to make these
	macros more universal.

	* src/pcmb_smp.c: Added this file to contain all SMP related
	code. This includes parsing the MP structures; initializing the
	APIC and IOAPIC; starting the CPUs; interrupt mapping; inter-CPU
	interrupts; and CPU synchronization in the event of a debuggable
	exception.
	Note: there is still a _lot_ of debugging code in here, mostly
	disabled, which needs cleaning up. Also, if this code is to ever
	be released to the public, it should probably be tidied up a bit
	more.

	* include/pcmb_intr.h: Added SMP support. This includes the
	inter-CPU interrupt vectors, interrupt masking, acknowledge, and
	CPU affinity via the APIC and IOAPIC.

	* cdl/hal_i386_pcmb.cdl: Added configury to compile pcmb_smp.c
	only when SMP is enabled. Also define HAL_PLATFORM_EXTRA to
	contain the SMP-ness of the HAL, so that RedBoot can report it.

2001-07-31  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* include/pcmb_io.h: Add IDE I/O macros.
	* cdl/hal_i386_pcmb.cdl: Now implements CYGINT_HAL_PLF_IF_IDE.

2001-07-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/pcmb_intr.h: Fill in interrupt table descriptions.

2001-07-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/pcmb_misc.c (hal_pcmb_init): Silence warning
	* include/pcmb_intr.h: Revert below change - not relevant in this case	
	for clobbers

2001-07-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/pcmb_intr.h: Be pedantic about register constraint syntax
	to satisfy newer compilers

2001-05-16  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/pcmb_misc.c (hal_pc_clock_initialize): Use mode 2 (rate generator)
	instead of mode 3 (square wave).

2001-05-03  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]	
	* cdl/hal_i386_pcmb.cdl: Changed option
	CYGIMP_HAL_I386_PCMB_SCREEN_SUPPORT to interface
	CYGINT_HAL_I386_PCMB_SCREEN_SUPPORT.

2001-03-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/pcmb_misc.c:
	Added hal_pcmb_init() which currently extracts memory sizes out of
	CMOS RAM.
	Added hal_i386_mem_real_region_top() to return top of either base
	or extended memory regions.	

	* include/pcmb_io.h: Added CMOS RAM access macros.

	* include/pcmb.inc: Removed memory size stuff.

	* cdl/hal_i386_pcmb.cdl:
	Added implement CYGINT_HAL_I386_MEM_REAL_REGION_TOP.

2001-03-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* include/pcmb.inc: Removed redundant FPU code.

2001-03-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* include/pcmb_intr.h: Rewrote HAL_INTERRUPT_ACKNOWLEDGE() and
	reinstated as main acknowledge mechanism.

2001-03-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]	
	* cdl/hal_i386_pcmb.cdl:
	* include/pcmb.inc:
	* include/pcmb_intr.h:
	* include/pcmb_io.h:
	* include/pcmb_serial.h:
	* src/pcmb_misc.c:
	* src/pcmb_screen.c:
	* src/pcmb_serial.c:
	Created this package to provide the support needed to run eCos
	binaries on an i386 PC using a standard motherboard. This package
	provides support for the standard PC devices: timers, interrupt
	controller, serial ports, ASCII display, keyboard, PCI bus
	etc. that are found on all PC compatible platforms.  It does not
	provide support for devices that may also be found on modern
	motherboards, such as ethernet, sound and video devices. These are
	supported by drivers elsewhere.
