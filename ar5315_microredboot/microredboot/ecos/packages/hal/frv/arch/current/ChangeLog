	* src/vectors.S (reset_vector): Add some debug-only led setting code.
	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: Rename auto-variable for clarity.
	* include/fr-v.h: Add defines for baud clock prescaler.
	* src/vectors.S: Fix check for PDM bits in potential resume.
	* src/vectors.S: Handle resume from sleep modes.
	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: Fix argv parsing for exec() command.
	* include/hal_diag.h src/hal_diag.c: Move support for the built-in
	16550-like chips found on all known implementations of these CPUs 
	into the arch directory to avoid duplication.
	* include/fr400.h include/fr500.h include/fr-v.h: Likewise many
	other register definitions.
	* src/hal_breakpoint.c: Likewise breakpoint/watchpoint stuff.
	* cdl/hal_frv.cdl: Changes to reflect the above.
	* src/vectors.S: Install exception vectors if not defined
	CYGSEM_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR. This way, syscalls and GDB work
	in RAM RedBoot.
	* cdl/hal_frv.cdl, src/redboot_linux_exec.c: Exec command.
	* src/vectors.S, src/context.S, include/hal_arch.h: Save extra GP
	and FP regs only when they're actually available on this CPU, if
	multiple CPUs are supported.
	* cdl/hal_frv.cdl: Disable use of break insn for trap. Remove 
		seemingly unnecessary option for hardware debugging.
	* include/hal_arch.h: Add _PSR_CM bit. It's not always hardwired.
	* src/hal_mk_defs.c: Ditto. Rename _HAL_THREAD_INIT_CONTEXT
	* src/vectors.S: Some ifdef cleanup, enable _PSR_CM

	 * cdl/hal_frv.cdl :
	 Invoke tail with stricter syntax that works in latest coreutils. 

2003-04-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* src/frv.ld:
	Added .eh_frame to data section. This is a stopgap fix to allow
	C++ programs that define exceptions to link and run. It does not
	allow them to actually throw exceptions, since that depends on
	compiler changes that have not been made. Further, more
	far-reaching, linker script changes will also be needs when that
	happens.
	Added libsupc++.a to GROUP() directive for GCC versions later than
	3.0.

2003-01-31  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_syscall.c (hal_syscall_handler): Let generic syscall code
	handle exit.

2002-04-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_syscall.c (hal_syscall_handler): Add extra sig argument to
	__do_syscall.

2001-12-10  Richard Sandiford  <rsandifo@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (save_state): Remove unnecessary DDR diddling when
	handling breaks.  Use BPCSR rather than BPCSR-4 as the break address.
	(restore_state): Take two new arguments: the register that the
	PC should be loaded into, and the argument to the rett instruction.
	(_break): If handling a break instruction, return to the following
	instruction using a normal "ret".  Ignore other kinds of break if
	they were triggered when traps were disabled; assume that an
	interrupt or exception handler has triggered a stack watchpoint
	accidentally.  Correct GP calculation.  Return using "rett #1"
	rather than "rett #0".

2001-11-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (_vectors): if defined(CYGPKG_HAL_FRV_FRV400) &&
	defined(CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INCLUDE_STUBS), add macro break_VSR
	to create a VSR entry which leaps to _break; rearrange the
	initialization of the VSR table so that the counts are correct;
	use break_VSR in slot 255; define _break which calls break_handler()
	much akin to exception handler().	

	Note that there is no need to define CYGSEM_HAL_FRV_HW_DEBUG for
	the FRV_FRV400 target; while we do use Hardware Debug, we don't
	use *that* sort of hardware debug, specifically we do not use
	hardware single-step, because it breaks as soon as we exit debug
	mode, ie whilst we are still within the stub.  But vectors.S does
	the same tidy-up of machine state, conditioned on FVR400 instead.

2001-10-17  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/frv_stub.c: Slight cleanup - only need |VLIW|+1 possible
	breakpoint locations.

2001-10-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (_exception_return): Remove *bad* workaround code
	now that single step VLIW works properly.

	* src/frv_stub.c (__clear_single_step): 
	(__single_step): Restructure to support VLIW sequences.

2001-10-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h: Remove [bogus] CYG_HAL_TABLE macros since 
	the common ones work fine on this architecture.

	* src/vectors.S: 
	* src/frv_stub.c: 
	* cdl/hal_frv.cdl: Add CDL to describe various [hardware] debug
	options.

2001-10-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: [FRV400] can't return from exception to a packed
	instruction - this yields illegal instruction.
	
2001-10-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_frv.cdl: 
	* include/basetype.h:
