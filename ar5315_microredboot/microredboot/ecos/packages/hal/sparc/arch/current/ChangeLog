	 * cdl/hal_sparc.cdl :
	 Invoke tail with stricter syntax that works in latest coreutils. 

2003-04-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* src/sparc.ld: 
	Added libsupc++.a to GROUP() directive for GCC versions later than
	3.0.

2002-10-19  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	Patch from Jiri Gaisler:
	* src/context.S (hal_thread_load_context): Wait a little after writing
	psr.
	(hal_setjmp): Ditto.
	* src/vectors.S (genuine_reset): Reorder window setup writes to
	streamline.

	* src/vectors.S:
	* src/vec_xvsr.S:
	* src/vec_ivsr.S:
	Don't use .file as it can confuse debugging since the .file
	doesn't contain the path and therefore the debugger will never
	know where it lives! This conflicts with using -Wa,--gstabs.

2002-03-18  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Add CYGPKG_HAL_SPARC_ERC32 to list of ifdefs.

2002-03-14  Jiri Gaisler  <jiri@gaisler.com>

	* Initial version based on the SPARClite HAL.
