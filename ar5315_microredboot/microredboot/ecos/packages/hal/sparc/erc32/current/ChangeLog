	* cdl/hal_sparc_erc32.cdl:
        Changed values for CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_NUMERATOR,
        CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_DENOMINATOR and CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_PERIOD to
        "default_value" from "calculated". This makes it easier
        to change these values globally.

	Patch from Jiri Gaisler:
	* cdl/hal_sparc_erc32.cdl: -msoft-float should be used in global
	CFLAGS, not just locally.
	* include/hal_diag.h: Fix UART TX masks.

	* Initial version based on the SPARClite SIM HAL.
