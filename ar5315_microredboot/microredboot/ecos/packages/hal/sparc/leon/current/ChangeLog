	* cdl/hal_sparc_leon.cdl:
        Changed values for CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_NUMERATOR,
        CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_DENOMINATOR and CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_PERIOD to
        "default_value" from "calculated". This makes it easier
        to change these values globally.

	Patch from Jiri Gaisler:
	* cdl/hal_sparc_leon.cdl: -msoft-float needn't be used in local package
	since it's defined globally.
	* include/hal_diag.h: Fix UART TX mask.

2002-03-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_sparc_leon.cdl: Add -msoft-cloat to CYGBLD_GLOBAL_CFLAGS
	(as well as LDFLAGS) - this gives perfect test coverage in minimal
	build with the sim.  NB pro tem the tools are called
	sparc-rtems-gcc et al, but sparc-elf-gcc et al should be OK.

	* Initial version based on the SPARClite SIM HAL.
