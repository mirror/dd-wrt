	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c (do_exec): Be sensitive to value in
	"entry_address" as this can indicate if the image to be executed
	is valid (the "load" functions set it to "NO_MEMORY" when invalid)

2004-04-22  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	 * cdl/hal_mn10300_am33.cdl :
	 Invoke tail with stricter syntax that works in latest coreutils.

2003-07-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* cdl/hal_mn10300_am33.cdl:
        Changed values for CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_NUMERATOR,
        CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_DENOMINATOR and CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_PERIOD to
        "default_value" from "calculated". This makes it easier
        to change these values globally.
        
2003-04-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* src/mn10300_am33.ld: 
	Added .eh_frame to data section. This is a stopgap fix to allow
	C++ programs that define exceptions to link and run. It does not
	allow them to actually throw exceptions, since that depends on
	compiler changes that have not been made. Further, more
	far-reaching, linker script changes will also be needs when that
	happens.
	Added libsupc++.a to GROUP() directive for GCC versions later than
	3.0.
