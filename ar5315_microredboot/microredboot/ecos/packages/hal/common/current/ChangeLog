2004-08-22  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* doc/porting.sgml: Replace [very misleading dated] comments
	about CygMon and platforms which use/need GDB stubs.

2004-08-12  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	* include/hal_if.h: Make monitor locking work with CYGPKG_LWIP.

2004-05-19  John Newlin <jnewlin@stretchinc.com>

	* src/hal_stub.c:
	(cyg_hal_gdb_interrupt) 
	(cyg_hal_gdb_remove_break): Changed both to use
	_read_mem_safe/__write_mem_safe for inserting a breakpoint, and
	restoring the original instruction.
	The Xtensa architecture (and others maybe?) can have unaligned
	instructions, which caused unaligned load/store exception.
	
2004-04-22  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	 * cdl/hal.cdl :
	 Invoke tail with stricter syntax that works in latest coreutils. 

2004-02-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/debugging.cdl (CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INCLUDE_STUBS): Included
	stubs should always mean saving full context both on interrupts
	and context swaps, so make it explicit.

2004-01-05  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* include/hal_if.h: Minor fixup - new 'fconfig' functions broke 
	existing uses of CYGACC_CALL_IF_FLASH_CFG_OP.  Added a new macro
	CYGACC_CALL_IF_FLASH_CFG_OP2 which handles new API and a wrapper
	to handle the old way (backwards compatability).

2003-12-21  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (flash_config_op): 
	* include/hal_if.h: New expanded functions for RedBoot 'fconfig'
	database.

2003-09-04  Patrick Doyle  <wpd@dtccom.com>

	* include/hal_if.h: 
	* src/hal_if.c (flash_fis_op): Added support for the rest of the
	FIS operations.

2003-08-06  Bob Koninckx <bob.koninckx@mech.kuleuven.ac.be>

	* src/drv_api.c: Added definition of cyg_interrupt_post_dsr() for
	use in those HALs that need it.

	* include/hal_arbiter.h (hal_call_isr): Removed ifdef on
	CYGFUN_HAL_COMMON_KERNEL_SUPPORT around test and call to
	cyg_interrupt_post_dsr().

2003-07-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* doc/hal.sgml: Reorganized description of clock and timer related
	stuff into their own section and added a piece about how to change
	the clock frequency.

2003-06-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (delay_us): The first test against
	CYGNUM_KERNEL_COUNTERS_RTC_PERIOD is now against the period
	divided by two. By the time we get to this test we know that usecs
	can never be > usec_per_period/2 so we can double the range of
	period values that we can handle without overflow and use the more
	efficient approximation. The second test is not changed since we
	cannot make the same assumptions about the elapsed count.

2003-06-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c (crc32): Fix crctable option name typo.

	* src/hal_if.c (hal_if_init): Remove kill_by_reset.
	(kill_by_reset): Remove, unused.
	(reset): ifdef test on HAL_PLATFORM_RESET and assert on reset failure.

	* cdl/interrupts.cdl (CYGNUM_HAL_COMMON_INTERRUPTS_STACK_SIZE): No
	reason to forbid people setting this quite small.
	
2003-06-19  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (delay_us): Reorganized to cope with high frequency
	timers by eliminating a source of arithmetic overflow. 

2003-05-06  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_stub.c (handle_exception_exit): Call sys_profile_reset from
	here. Setup to return through return_from_stub() when appropriate.
	(return_from_stub): New function to call CYGACC_CALL_IF_MONITOR_RETURN
	from thread context.

	* src/generic-stub.c (__handle_exception): Call exit_vec if
	hal_syscall_handler returns negative number.

2003-04-08  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_default_isr): Allow HAL to override default
	GDB vector matching test.

2003-04-08  Yoshinori Sato  <qzb04471@nifty.ne.jp>
2003-04-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/debugging.cdl: Allow CRC to be allocated in ROM as well as RAM.
	* src/generic-stub.c: as above.

2003-04-02  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c: 
	* include/generic-stub.h: Cleanup when program args are not
	supported (remove some unused static storage).

2003-03-03  Knud Woehler <knud.woehler@microplex.de>

	* src/hal_if.c:
	* include/hal_if.h: Add CYGNUM_CALL_IF_FLASH_FIS_OP. FIS read
	via the virtual vector table.
	
2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Fix doc links.

	* doc/hal.sgml: hal-common-current-doc-porting-sgml entity ->
	hal-common-porting-sgml in line with other docs.

2003-02-13  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/gdb-fileio.h (FILEIO_O_BINARY): New flag.
	(FILEIO_O_TEXT): New flag.

2003-01-31  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_if.h: Add CYGNUM_CALL_IF_MONITOR_RETURN.

2002-12-04  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: RAM applications should not claim (reset) version
	string by default.

2002-12-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (hal_if_init): 
	* include/hal_if.h: 
	* cdl/hal.cdl: Allow monitor (RedBoot) version string to be exported
	via the virtual vector table.

2002-11-13  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Add CDL control over DATA cache startup mode.

2002-09-11  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_if.h: Add __COMMCTL_ENABLE_LINE_FLUSH and
	__COMMCTL_DISABLE_LINE_FLUSH.

2002-08-29  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* include/generic-stub.h: Add defines for Z packet types.
	* src/bplist-dynamic.c: Add support for deferred hardware breakpoint
	and watchpoint insertion/deletion. This gets around gdb problem where
	gdb tries accessing watched memory before removing watchpoint.
	* src/generic-stub.c (__process_packet): Ditto.
	* include/hal_stub.h: Ditto.

2002-05-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Don't build tests that are not applicable with the
	current configuration.
	Added CYGINT_HAL_TESTS_NO_CACHES which allows cache tests to be
	suppressed.

2002-05-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Removed
	CYGINT_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_SUPPORT_NOT_GUARANTEED option and its
	dependencies.

2002-05-02  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* doc/hal.sgml: Added description of HAL_DELAY_US().

	* doc/porting.sgml: Expanded section on architecture porting.

2002-04-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/gdb-fileio.c (cyg_hal_gdbfileio_process_F_packet): Reset
	retcode/errno/ctrlc status every F packet.

2002-04-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* doc/porting.sgml: Fix some typos.

2002-04-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/generic-stub.h: Prototype __getpacket().
	* src/generic-stub.c: Rename getpacket() -> __getpacket(),
	remcomInBuffer -> __remcomInBuffer, and
	remcomOutBuffer -> __remcomOutBuffer throughout file, and export
	them (i.e. not file local).
	(__process_packet): Handle $F packets file I/O protocol responses.

	* src/gdb-fileio.c: New file to implement file I/O operations over
	the GDB remote protocol.
	* src/gdb-fileio.h: New file. Header for above.

2002-03-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* doc/porting.sgml: Platform HAL porting guide tidied up and
	expanded somewhat. Some work also done on variant
	guide. Architecture guided needs a lot more work.

	* doc/hal.sgml: Changed explicit section tags to recursive section
	tags to make any future restructuring easier.

2002-03-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_stub.c: Add calls to HAL memory access check macros in
	memory access functions.

	* include/hal_stub.h: Added default definitions for HAL memory access
	check macros.

2002-03-06  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* tests/cache.c: Changed tests so that zero sized caches and HALs
	that define HAL_DCACHE_PURGE_ALL() don't cause this test to throw
	a compilation error.

2002-02-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c (__handle_exception): Pay attention to return
	value from hal_syscall_handler.

2002-02-21  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (cyg_hal_diag_mangler_gdb_flush): Don't do anything
	if buffer is empty.

2002-02-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* doc/hal.sgml: Updated and tidied. Now includes porting guide
	from a separate file.

	* doc/porting.sgml: Added this file to contain the porting guide
	section of the HAL document. This is currently largely a
	conversion of Jesper's porting guide from the website.
	Unfortunately I have had no time to do much more than include it
	wholesale, with only minor edits. There are some notes at the end
	of the file describing what I would like to do.

2002-02-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* doc/hal.sgml: Restructured most of this document and rewrote
	large chunks of the basic HAL description stuff. Only the skeleton
	of the porting guided is currently done. This checkin in mostly
	for safety and to let others read the current state.

2002-02-06  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (cyg_hal_diag_mangler_gdb_control): Add flush support.
	(cyg_hal_diag_mangler_gdb_flush): New function to flush mangler output.
	(cyg_hal_diag_mangler_gdb_putc): Use new function to flush output.

2002-01-30  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_if.h (CYGNUM_FLASH_CFG_OP_CONFIG_INT): New defines for
	getting Flash Config options out of RedBoot using VV call
	CYGACC_CALL_IF_FLASH_CFG_OP().  These need to be kept uptodate
	with (or must override) those in RedBoot's flash_config.h
	Previously only used for getting an ESA.

2002-01-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c (__process_packet): If detach or kill, call
	sys_profile_reset() if BSP_SYSCALLS_GPROF are enabled, to clear
	out any dangerous state there.  Such as a callback function
	pointer into application code.

2002-01-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/drv_api.h: Add cyg_drv_interrupt_mask/unmask_intunsafe
	* src/drv_api.c: Ditto. And modify 
	 cyg_drv_interrupt_mask/unmask to be interrupt safe.
	
2002-01-21  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_spd.h: New file. Definitions for SDRAM module SPD.

2002-01-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_stub.c (__build_t_packet): don't declare extend_val
	twice.

2001-12-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_stub.h: Add goto to the used label.
	* src/hal_misc.c: Added (dummy) got for label used in
	CYGARC_HAL_GET_RETURN_ADDRESS_BACKUP.

2001-12-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/dbg-threads-syscall.c (dbg_thread_syscall): Don't bother to
	deref a func ptr. The opcode could theoretically be 0x0!

2001-12-04  Richard Sandiford  <rsandifo@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c (__add_char_to_packet): Reverse check for
	end of buffer and end of packet to fix potential buffer overrun.

2001-12-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/dbg-threads-syscall.c (dbg_thread_syscall): check for
	NULL dbg_syscall_ptr.

	* cdl/hal.cdl: require CYGPKG_INFRA since all HALs do!

2001-11-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_stub.c: Enable HAL_STUB_HW_SEND_STOP_REASON_TEXT for
	XScale architectures per Mark's request; XScale GDB needs to know
	what's happening with watchpoints (= work around previous change)

2001-11-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_stub.c: Condition out sending the reason for hardware
	watchpoint stop in the stop packet as $T05watch:01234568;... most
	GDBs do not understand it and in fact object to it.

2001-11-23  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c (__process_packet): Fixed bogosity in
	handling of 'r' packet. It tried to send two replies, messing up
	the protocol and confusing GDB.

2001-11-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_stub.h (CYG_HAL_GDB_LEAVE_CRITICAL_IO_REGION):
	Permit this too to be defined externally ie. in a platform HAL.

2001-10-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: 
	* cdl/debugging.cdl: Reorg CDL a little so that GDB stub routines
	are only compiled when needed (instead of being compiled "empty").

2001-10-24  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Add 'basic' test.

	* tests/basic.c: New test of some minimal HAL functionality.

2001-10-18  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (cyg_hal_diag_mangler_gdb_putc): 
	* cdl/debugging.cdl: CYGNUM_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_PROTOCOL_RETRIES is now
	defined as CDL 'data' flavor (tested via #if vs. #ifdef)

2001-10-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c: Prefixed local version of memcpy and memset
	with _.

2001-10-17  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/debugging.cdl: 
	* src/hal_if.c (cyg_hal_diag_mangler_gdb_putc): Make retry/abort optional,
	only attemped if CYGNUM_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_PROTOCOL_RETRIES is configured to
	be non-zero (default now 0).

2001-10-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_stub.h: Allow ISOINFRA/LIBC to provide string
	functions.

2001-10-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/generic-stub.h: Add prototypes for breakpoint_list functions.

2001-10-15  David Howells  <dhowells@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_stub.h: put semicolon between goto-label and close curly.

2001-10-12  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/thread-packets.c: Don't specify array sizes in extern decls.

	* src/hal_stub.c: Use HAL_STUB_REGISTERS_SIZE to set number of elements
	in register save areas. Default to NUMREGS if not defined by HAL.
	Allow HALs to provide specialized get_register()/put_register().

	* src/generic-stub.c (stub_format_registers): Support 'p' packet.
	(__process_packet): Rearrange ifdefs so error is sent for unsupported
	Z packet types.
	(process_query): Add hook for HAL specific queries.
	(process_set): Add hook for HAL specific sets.

	* include/generic-stub.h: Add extern decls to quiet compiler warnings.

2001-10-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/generic-stub.h: 
	* src/generic-stub.c: Improve error handling more.  Make sure that
	packets are consumed, even if they are going to be tossed (overflow).
	This keeps TCP based connections going, even when the data is bad.
	(getpacket): Only send NAK in case of overflow.

2001-10-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (flash_config_op): Protect with
	CYGARC_HAL_SAVE_GP.

2001-10-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_endian.h: Added.
	Fix typo.

2001-10-03  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_tables.h (CYG_HAL_TABLE_BEGIN): Use plain "object"
	because	some (only some though) MIPS tools complain with %object.
	(CYG_HAL_TABLE_END): Ditto.

2001-10-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_tables.h (CYG_HAL_TABLE_BEGIN): Use %object syntax
	rather than @object since @ is a comment character on ARM. gas
	accepts either syntax.
	(CYG_HAL_TABLE_END): Ditto.

2001-10-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c (getpacket): Send back error response (E01) if
	packet received which overflows buffers.  GDB doesn't always do much
	with this error, but at least it keeps the protocol moving.

2001-09-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/common.cdl: New interface CYGINT_HAL_SUPPORTS_MMU_TABLES which
	indicates if the HAL supports MMU tables (few do).

2001-09-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/common.cdl (CYGSEM_HAL_INSTALL_MMU_TABLES): Change to be
	default for ROM startup.

2001-09-20  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/vaargs.c (cyg_start): Call CYG_TEST_INIT.

2001-09-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_stub.h (strlen): Changed return type to size_t from
	int so it matches <string.h>. For some reason the compiler has
	suddenly started complaining about the type mismatch. Strange.

2001-09-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_stub.c (put_register): Added kludge for VR4300 targets
	to sign extent the PC when it is being set. This is due to the
	age of the VR4300 toolchain and the fact that the VR4300 is the
	only target to do full 64bit register saves/restores.

2001-09-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_if.h: Fix typo in below change.

2001-09-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_if.h (CYGACC_CALL_IF_DBG_SYSCALL): Define and call
	with correct arguments.

2001-08-24  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c (__process_packet): Add support for 'D' packet.
	(__process_packet): Check for impossible mem write length.

2001-08-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Add CYGINT_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_COMM_BAUD_SUPPORT
	interface.

2001-08-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Add CDL options to control GDB protocol retries.

2001-08-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (cyg_hal_diag_mangler_gdb_putc): Use timeout
	functions to allow for retries.  This should improve the case
	where [for whatever reason] the host GDB misses or ignores 
	a $O packet - it will get resent after a reasonable timeout.

2001-08-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>
2001-08-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_if.h: Use inline functions for calls - allowing
	interrupts to be disabled while services are called
	[CYGACC_COMM_IF_CONTROL is an exception since it's using variable
	arguments - so it's still a macro].
	Pruned unused IF vectors: ICTRL_TABLE, EXC_TABLE, DBG_VECTOR,
	CPU_DATA, BOARD_DATA, SYSINFO, SET_SERIAL_BAUD.
	Note: this should fix bug CR 902745-CR.

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Removed CYGSEM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_CLAIM_ICTRL.
	* src/hal_if.c (hal_if_init): Removed initialization of
	ICTRL_TABLE, EXC_TABLE, CPU_DATA and BOARD_DATA entries.

2001-08-03  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

        Imported from a development branch:
	
	2001-07-11  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

		* include/drv_api.h: 
		* src/drv_api.c:
		Added API for controlling routing of interrupts to CPUs in SMP
		configurations.

	2001-06-29  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

		* include/drv_api.h: 
		* src/drv_api.c:
		Added API for using spinlocks.

2001-08-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/vaargs.c: Added.
	* cdl/hal.cdl: Added CYGPKG_HAL_BUILD_COMPILER_TESTS to allow cpp1
	and vaargs tests to be compiled conditionally.

2001-07-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/intr.c: Set up interrupt ISR using driver API so it works
	properly in chained mode in the presence of arbiters.

	* src/drv_api.c (chain_isr): Call default ISR when
	appropriate. Return ISR return value.

	* include/hal_arbiter.h (hal_call_isr): Added version to be used
	with interrupt chaining.

2001-07-24  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl (CYGINT_HAL_PLF_IF_IDE): New interface which
	indicates platform supports IDE controller I/F macros.

2001-06-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl (CYGPKG_HAL_TESTS): Remove redundant .c extension

2001-06-29  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_misc.h: Moved arbiter helper to
	* include/hal_arbiter.h: this file to avoid header file inclusion
	order problems.

2001-06-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_misc.h (hal_call_isr): Added. Used by ISR arbiters.

2001-06-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c (BUFMAX): Define as platform specific, thus
	reducing memory requirements.
	(__process_packet): Eliminate program arguments support until eCos
	makes use of them (more memory savings).

2001-06-22  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_stub.c (__do_copy_mem): Add goto statement to prevent
	compiler from moving instructions across 'err' label.

2001-06-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c (__process_packet): Don't reset the board
	straight away with a 'r' packet. Let a 'k' packet do it instead.

	* src/hal_stub.c (__install_traps): Remove redundant comment.

2001-06-11  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (delay_us): Revert below change of 2001-05-17

2001-06-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (cyg_hal_diag_mangler_gdb_putc): The nesting of
	CYGARC_HAL_SAVE_GP() and the instant-out if sending a carriage
	return "\r" was wrong - it scrambled the gp for the caller!  Since
	the return-test is trivial, I simply re-ordered rather than making
	the exit clause complex with a restore in it.

2001-05-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (delay_us): Warn if using default

2001-05-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/interrupts.cdl (CYGNUM_HAL_COMMON_INTERRUPTS_STACK_SIZE):
	Default stack size to 32K for non-kernel configs, and describe

2001-05-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (hal_ctrlc_check): Only return 'true' if the ISR/DSR
	actually processes a ^C.  Otherwise, interrupts/date can be lost on
	a shared channel (like an ethernet device).

2001-04-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Add configury to control initial cache behaviour.

2001-04-30  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Add tests/cpp1.c to the tests list.

	* tests/cpp1.c: New test, to test for regressions in the tools.
	This one is for a CPP bug in the XScale tools where '+' binds too
	strongly following a ')' because it is mistaken for unary plus.

2001-04-25  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* tests/cache.c:
	Fix test for cache presence.

	* src/drv_api.c (cyg_drv_interrupt_detach):

	* include/dbg-threads-api.h: Add dbg_thread_id() function prototype.

2001-03-21  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (hal_if_init): Add explicit typecast when setting 
	version. Needed when sizeof(int) < sizeof(CYG_ADDRWORD).

2001-03-21  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	(handle_exception_cleanup): Skip orig_registers past breakpoint so we
	return to original context rather than hit breakpoint again.

2001-03-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_if.h: Define types and slots and macros themed with
	the phrase CALL_IF_FLASH_CFG_OP following the pattern of what's
	there for the other slots.  Thus CYGNUM_CALL_IF_FLASH_CFG_OP,
	CYGACC_CALL_IF_FLASH_CFG_OP(...) and __call_if_flash_cfg_op_fn_t
	are all newly defined.  Also CYGNUM_CALL_IF_FLASH_CFG_GET which is
	the only operation supported in this initial version.

	Also changed many typedef'd function pointers to not include the
	pointerness; that way the type can be used to validate the
	correctness of arguments in the called function.

	* src/hal_stub.c (__reset): Minor change to reset function
	handling; pointerness of typedef removed.

	* src/hal_if.c (flash_config_op): New function to call flash ops
	in RedBoot.  This is so that RedBoot can manage ethernet addresses
	for you, and the application can get at the data "cleanly".
	(hal_if_init): Install flash_config_op() in the table if defined.

2001-03-12  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c (cyg_hal_user_break): Use macro to find PC
	in saved regs.

	* src/hal_if.c (hal_if_init): 
	Support platform specific initializations.

2001-02-26  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c (__process_packet): Change 'k' packet to cause
	return to original context. Change 'r' packet to respond with empty
	packet before resetting board.

	CHANNEL_CONFIGURABLE options.
	* cdl/common.cdl: Added CYGDBG_HAL_DIAG_TO_DEBUG_CHAN option.

	driver init from CLAIM_COMMS code.
	* src/hal_stub.c: Leave channel setup to CLAIM_COMMS code.

	* src/hal_if.c: Added null mangler that gets called via the
	virtual vector console comms entry and just forwards IO to the
	debug comms entries.  This differs from setting the console
	channel to the same as the debug channel in that console output
	will go to the debug channel even if the debug channel is changed.

2001-02-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_if.h: Allow architecture to override COMM and CALL
	accessor macros.

2001-02-02  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c: __set_breakpoint and __remove_breakpoint now
	take a length argument.

	* src/bplist-dynamic.c: Support breakpoint length. Use 
	HAL_BREAKINST_ADDR macro (if defined) to get actual breakpoint based
	on breakpoint length.

	* include/hal_stub.h: Add len argument to __set_breakpoint and
	__remove_breakpoint.

2001-02-01  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/drv_api.c: Make it build with chaining.

	* include/hal_if.h: Introduce macros for legal version range and
	special hacked version number used by ctrlc magic.
	* src/hal_if.c (hal_ctrlc_isr_init): Be more careful with how the
	version number is checked (and trashed) by the ctrlc init code.
	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_default_isr): Same.

	* src/hal_stub.c: Moved mangling code to hal_if.c
	* src/hal_if.c: New policies for when and how to initialize the
	IO channels. Mangler code now set up by diag_init to allow for
	mangling when no stub is included.

	* include/hal_if.h: Added COMM version in upper 16 bits of version
	word. Removed CYGPRI_HAL_IMPLEMENTS_IF_SERVICES.
	* src/hal_misc.c: Use masks when checking vv versions.

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Add new options for selecting which parts of the
	virtual vector table to initialize.

	stubs.

2001-01-31  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	options. They are replaced by the CYGSEM_HAL_DIAG_MANGLER option.

2001-01-31  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_if.h: Make it possible to build logical ether driver
	even without virtual vectors present, by defining a dummy
	HAL_CTRLC_CHECK in that case; other code invokes it if debugging
	per se is enabled.

2001-01-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_stub.c (__reset): Rename HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_RESETx macros
	to HAL_PLATFORM_RESETx.
	* src/hal_if.c (reset): Same.

2001-01-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/drv_api.c: Initialized isr_disable_counter to 1 so that it
	indicates that interrupts are initially disabled.

2000-12-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c: Define 'version' string to be a weak
	symbol that can be easily overridden (e.g. by RedBoot).

2000-12-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c: Remove unnecessary (polluting) include file.

	* include/hal_stub.h: Support platform/variant supplied
	include files.  <cyg/hal/plf_XXX.h> can now be layered
	as <cyg/hal/var_XXX.h> which includes <cyg/hal/plf_XXX.h>.

2000-12-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (delay_us): Ensure proper _GP save/restore.

	to align label
	(CYG_HAL_TABLE_TYPE): Define

2000-09-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

        * src/hal_stub.c (__build_t_packet): Ensure sign extension applies
        in the higher word, not the lower.
	(__build_t_packet): Don't need to conditionalize on
	CYGARC_REGSIZE_DIFFERS_FROM_TARGET_REGISTER_T as there should be no
	problems with the current code.
	* src/generic-stub.c (stub_format_registers): Likewise

	* include/hal_if.h (CYGACC_COMM_IF_CONTROL): Remove warning due to
	unnecessary use of cpp paste operator

2000-08-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c: 
	* include/hal_if.h (hal_ctrlc_check): Define new routine to be
	called by interrupt handlers (DSRs) which may be using hardware
	shared with a debug channel.  In particular, network adaptors 
	need to call this function to see if a ^C has occurred on the
	network debug connection.

2000-08-24  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_tables.h: Need descriminated tables (for proper sorting).

2000-08-14  Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_stub.c: Cleanup of #define's.

	* src/generic-stub.c: Rearrange the linkage between Cygmon and HAL so

	functions for flushing the cache.
	Also handle the case where target_register_t is not defined.

2000-07-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c (CYGNUM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_NUM_CHANNELS): Define to allow
	the number of channels to be extended by "AUX" packages.

2000-07-20  Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c (stub_format_registers): Make the previous patch

	* src/hal_stub.c: Ditto.

2000-07-19  Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@redhat.com>

	* src/generic-stub.c (stub_format_registers): Handle the case
	where GDB is expecting registers larger than we are storing.  ie
	MIPS gdb expects 64 bit registers even if we are on a 32 bit
	architecture.  Also, handle the sign-extension correctly if
	necessary.
	* src/hal_stub.c (__build_t_packet): Ditto.

2000-07-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_default_isr):

2000-07-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/debugging.cdl: Only allow CTRLC support if there's stubs or
	a ROM monitor to handle it. (Haruki Kashiwaya (kashiwaya at redhat
	dot com)).

2000-06-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_if.h: Make CYGACC macros call functions. May have to
	add some _GET macros at some time if anyone needs to access the
	function pointers.

	* src/hal_stub.c: 
	* src/hal_misc.c:
	* src/hal_if.c:
	Matching changes of CYGACC clients.

	flag and breakpoint if set.

2000-06-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_stub.c (cyg_hal_gdb_diag_putc): Don't try to set
	breakpoints in ROM startup - just disable interrupts. Also, use
	procs table function to disable device interrupts.

	* include/hal_if.h: Mark vector/comms arrays volatile to avoid
	compiler confusion.

	* include/dbg-threads-api.h: Fix C/C++ declaration issues.

	* src/hal_stub.c: Moved stub platform init call below vector table
	setup.

	* src/hal_misc.c:
	* src/hal_if.c:
	* include/hal_if.h: DBG_ISR_VECTOR and SET_TIMEOUT functions added
	to comms table. Added DELAY_US function to vector table. Made
	switching of debug channel dis/enable Ctrl-c interrupts as
	well. Made ctrlc_isr code use new vector entries. All this amounts
	to a properly switchable debug channel.

2000-06-21  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_stub.c: Fixed clients of vector procs tables to pass
	in the correct arguments. Hook O-packetizer up on procs slot
	reserved for IO mangler. Install mangler when necessary.

	* src/hal_if.c: Extended set procs functions to allow temporarily
	switching console procs in a safe manner. Removed debug and
	console wrappers - all IO happens via drivers hooked up in tables
	rather than through hardwired macros. Proper initialization of
	console proc entry. Fixed clients of vector procs tables to pass
	in the correct arguments. Stub now does its own vector table
	initialization. Added special procs slot for IO manglers.

	* include/hal_if.h: Define special IDs used by the set procs
	functions. PROCS_HANDLED removed since the procs table will now
	always service any port.

2000-06-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_stub.h: Added underscore to breakinst().

	* include/hal_tables.h:

	systematic and extensible way.

2000-06-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Revert change below - GUARANTEED can exist
	with STUBS defined.

2000-06-18  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Use of virtual vector functions for diagnostic
	output must be disabled when building with stubs.  Note: this
	lets stubs be built for platforms with guaranteed virtual 
	vector support.

2000-06-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_if.h: All vector-dependant features hidden when

	these by providing raw IO functions and some config data.

2000-06-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_if.c: Implemented most of the remaining services. Some
	just don't have an eCos equivalent at the moment.

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Allow virtual_vector options to have sensible
	default values depending on when the platform HAL port was
	written.

	* src/hal_misc.c (cyg_hal_user_break): Also expect CygMon to
	provide the breakpoint service.

	* src/stubrom/stubrom.c (cyg_start): Reverted change. Now handled
	by hal_if_init.

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Added option for controlling use of diag services
	in the virtual vector table.

2000-06-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/stubrom/stubrom.c: Call hal_diag_init to ensure IF table
	entries related to diag IO get initialized.

	* src/hal_stub.c (cyg_hal_gdb_interrupt): save/restore GP so it
	can be used by MIPS platforms.
	Use reset function in ROM if available.

	* src/hal_misc.c: 
	* include/hal_misc.h: Functions shared between HALs. More
	functions are likely to be moved here if appropriate.

	* src/hal_if.c: Interfacing related functions: table init code and
	function wrappers.

	* include/hal_if.h: ROM/RAM calling interface table
	definitions. The layout is a combination of libbsp and vectors
	already in use by some eCos platforms.
	

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Added CYGxxx_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_SUPPORT
	options. These are used to control whether a platform uses the new
	ROM/RAM calling interface. All platforms will be converted to use
	this, but piecemeal over a period of time, thus the requirement
	for selecting behavior.

2000-06-04  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Support variant 'pkgconf' headers.  This will allow
	[variant] common symbols to be defined, rather than duplicating 
	them over all platforms using that variant.

	* cdl/debugging.cdl: Allow thread support to included for ROM
	monitor builds.

	Removed HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_STUBS_INIT.

2000-02-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Added remaining build dependencies.

2000-02-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Fix test list display.

2000-02-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h: CYG_HAL_POWERPC_x->CYGPKG_...

2000-02-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/debugging.cdl: Use interfaces for stub capabilities instead
	of exclude list.

2000-01-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Added simple build rules for common stub.

2000-01-26  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c (__reset): Replace CYGDAT_CYGMON_ENABLE
	dependency with just CYGPKG_CYGMON
	(initHardware): Likewise
	(__set_baud_rate): Likewise
	(putDebugChar): Likewise

2000-01-17  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/common.cdl,
	  cdl/debugging.cdl:

	Modify the default_value attribute for
	CYGFUN_HAL_COMMON_KERNEL_SUPPORT, CYGPKG_HAL_EXCEPTIONS
	and CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_THREAD_SUPPORT to do the right
	thing in the absence of the eCos kernel package.

1999-12-22  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal.cdl:

	Add CFLAGS to the custom rule for extras.o to accommodate

	platforms to put ROM-monitor related options into
	Move all ROM-monitor related options into individual platform CDL

1999-11-29  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal.cdl:

	Use wildcard in the custom rule for extras.o to
	accommodate 'make -n'.

1999-11-23  Simon Fitzmaurice <sdf@cygnus.co.uk>
	* cdl\common.cdl: Correct example of illiteracy

1999-11-20  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>
	
	* cdl/common.cdl: Add MMU tables options.

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h (CYGSEM_HAL_INSTALL_MMU_TABLES): 
	(CYGSEM_HAL_STATIC_MMU_TABLES): New options to control MMU table
	flavour and placement.

1999-11-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/dbg-threads-api.h, include/generic-stub.h,
	include/hal_stub.h: Add comments to explain these header files should
	not be included by user programs

1999-11-09  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/common.cdl: Add CYGDBG_HAL_DIAG_DISABLE_GDB_PROTOCOL.
	
	* include/pkgconf/hal.h (CYGDBG_HAL_DIAG_DISABLE_GDB_PROTOCOL): 
	New option which [explicitly] controls use of GDB protocol
	for diagnostic I/O.

1999-11-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: More crud out + mn10300 fixes.

1999-11-02  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal.cdl: Cleaned out some of the CPU config entries.

1999-10-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/PKGconf.mak: Add cache tests for Cirrus Logic boards.

1999-10-29  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/cache.c: Made safe for targets with no cache.

	* tests/PKGconf.mak: Don't build cache test for ARM unless
	explicitly enabled.

1999-10-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/cache.c: Fix array size.

1999-10-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c: Fix typo (CYGDAT_CYGMON_ENABLE).  Also need
	to include <pkgconf/cygmon.h>

1999-10-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c: Add explicit enable for CygMon package.

1999-10-27  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c (cyg_hal_gdb_interrupt): Bugfix to previous: ^Cs
	were being ignored when received by the diag output code, because
	there was already a break in place.  Solution is to let
	cyg_hal_gdb_interrupt() override any previous break, and tidy up
	state of course.

1999-10-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_stub.h (CYG_HAL_GDB_ENTER_CRITICAL_IO_REGION): Place
	the break at the address of a label within the calling context
	[normally hal_diag_write_char()]; this is neater and more
	portable; it's supported for more targets.  Also use
	cyg_hal_place_break() to place it, define that, &c.

	* src/hal_stub.c (cyg_hal_gdb_place_break): New routine to
	specially handle the inline breakpoint.  It basically does the
	same as cyg_hal_gdb_interrupt(), except on some platforms where
	you must do different things to set a bp from a non-interrupt
	context.

1999-10-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c (putDebugChar, getDebugChar): When building with
	CygMon, these functions are defined by CygMon.

1999-10-26  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal.cdl:

	Modify custom make rule to specify file paths relative
	to the package version directory.

1999-10-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_stub.h (CYG_HAL_GDB_ENTER_CRITICAL_IO_REGION):
	(CYG_HAL_GDB_LEAVE_CRITICAL_IO_REGION): new macros to be invoked
	in hal_diag routines to make atomic the code that outputs a
	complete GDB $O packet.  This is required so that watching
	variables (which is implemented by stepping) and stepping itself
	does not try to ss through that $O output code.  CASE 102327.

	* src/hal_stub.c (cyg_hal_gdb_break_is_set): new routine to query
	whether a break is set: used by step in the stubs to decide to
	continue instead, because we are in a critical region.
	(cyg_hal_gdb_running_step): communication between generic stub and
	here: if set, a step has been converted into a continue, so we do
	NOT obey cyg_hal_gdb_remove_break until it is cleared, in
	handle_exception_cleanup().

	* src/generic-stub.c (__process_packet): If there is a break set
	by the hal_stub.c, convert a step to continue, and set
	cyg_hal_gdb_running_step to say we did so.

1999-10-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>
        Case 102379
	* src/generic-stub.c (__handle_exception): Flush and clear caches
	after cleaning up after single-stepping.

	(memcpy, memset): Added to prevent stub hanging if user puts
	breakpoints in either function.

1999-10-19  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h: Added monitor configury for Brother
	board.
	
1999-10-10  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/thread-packets.c (stub_pkt_currthread): Fix typo in comment.

	* src/generic-stub.c: Reorg to expose register get/set functions.

1999-10-08  Simon Fitzmaurice <sdf@cygnus.co.uk>
	* cdl\interrupts.cdl: Quoted '[' and ']' (significant in TCL and thus CDL)

1999-10-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/interrupts.cdl: Added
	CYGIMP_HAL_COMMON_INTERRUPTS_IGNORE_SPURIOUS.

1999-09-22  Simon FitzMaurice <sdf@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl\hal.cdl : add priority field to "extras.o" rule

1999-09-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/thread-packets.c: Fix some typos in comments.

1999-09-15  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c: Override generic GDB interrupt functions for
	ARM. Need them to be thumb aware. 

1999-09-13  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h: Add new config option to allow spurious
	interrupts to be ignored by the HAL.

	* src/generic-stub.c (__process_packet): Build in version string
	(date/time) for stubs in ROM to be returned via 'd' packet.

1999-09-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h (CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INCLUDE_STUBS): Rename
	CYGPKG_HAL_MN10300_SIM to CYGPKG_HAL_MN10300_AM31_SIM

1999-09-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/dbg-threads-syscall.c (dbg_currthread_id): Fixed to return
	zero if dbg_currthread() returns false. Previously it could have
	returned a random value which would have made GDB think there had
	been a thread switch when there hadn't. It was particularly prone
	to do this in configurations where the kernel was absent.

1999-09-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h: Always include target and platform package
	include (pkgconf) files.

1999-08-26  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/generic-stub.c (__hex2mem_helper):
	Use target_register_t when casting to address type, rather than long
	Since the compiler can choose arbitrary alignment of unions, force
	to use byte array only
	Restore use of loop termination test for *hexMemSrc, just in case
	since that's how it used to be
	Increment destination, not source at end of loop
	
	(__mem2hex_helper):
	Use target_register_t when casting to address type, rather than long.
	Since the compiler can choose arbitrary alignment of unions, force
	to use byte array only. Therefore use single __read_mem_safe() call
	
	* src/hal_stub.c (__do_copy_mem): Reassign back from dst/src at start
	of each	"if" clause in case we go round the loop again.

1999-08-24  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c (__do_copy_mem): Move temp variables to top of
	function - potentially safer if there is an error.

1999-08-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/generic-stub.c (__process_packet): For 'g' and 'G' packets,
	when the register size differs from sizeof(target_register_t) we must
	adjust according to the endianness 

	* include/hal_stub.h: Ensure __LITTLE_ENDIAN__ is defined on
	little-endian targets

	* src/hal_stub.c (__build_t_packet): Use the correct register sizes
	for PC and SP rather than assuming they are the same as target_register_t

1999-08-23  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/generic-stub.h: Change prototypes for internal functions.

	* src/hal_stub.c (__do_copy_mem): 
	* src/generic-stub.c (__mem2hex_helper): Rework to perform aligned,
	multi-byte operations when conditions allow.  This should handle
	most "hardware register" access cases.  Note: there currently is
	no good way to force GDB to require/use such accesses.

1999-08-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/intr.c (cyg_start): Use CYG_TEST_NA rather than a pass saying
	it's inapplicable

1999-08-16  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h: Rename CYG_HAL_MN10300_AM32_STDEVAL1 to
	CYG_HAL_MN10300_AM31_STDEVAL1

1999-08-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c: Removed superfluous trace() extern.

1999-08-12  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>	

	Imported following changes from AM33 branch:
	
    1999-07-27  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c: Added support for 1 byte breakpoints.
	Removed	invalidates for cache flushes - I am not entirely sure why
	we have these here, since HAL_DCACHE_SYNC() should do what we
	need, and these invalidates are causing a problem on the MIPS and
	MN10300 targets.

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h: Added Monitor selection for AM33.

    1999-06-29  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

        PR20157
	* tests/cache.c: Print stride values, preventing timeout on slow
	targets.

1999-06-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h (CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_BREAK_SUPPORT):
	Fixed parent.

1999-06-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h: Clarify descriptions of
	CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_BREAK_SUPPORT and
	CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT.

1999-06-17  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h: Added CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT
	to enable inclusion of ^C interrupt handler. Added CDL to control
	it.

1999-06-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h: Add support for the PowerPC target MBX860
	platform, CYG_HAL_POWERPC_MBX.

1999-06-10  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c: Need to init register pointer.

1999-05-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h: Renamed SH platform package to edk7708.

1999-05-28  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c (initHardware): Added call to
	HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_INIT if it is defined.

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h: Added a #undef for CYG_HAL_ROM_MONITOR,
	largely so that a stubrom permutation can define it.

1999-05-27  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c: Do not call HAL_ICACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL() and
	HAL_DCACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL() in __instruction_cache() and
	__data_cache() for MIPS targets. These macros are simply
	duplicates.

1999-05-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/cache.c:  Added handling of unified caches.

1999-05-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/intr.c: Get RTC values from CYGBLD_HAL_PLATFORM_H.
	Ensure there are fallback definitions.

	* src/hal_stub.c (handle_exception_cleanup): Added optional call
	of HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_STUBS_FIXUP macro.

1999-05-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c (hal_output_gdb_string): Added missing ;

1999-05-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	The following changes were all made on a branch and imported into
	the main trunk later.
	
    1999-05-11  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h:
	tidied up all MIPS targets to include CYGBLD_HAL_TARGET_H. This
	will eventually apply to all configurations.

    1999-05-06  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/PKGconf.mak (COMPILE): Added dbg-threads-syscall.c.

	* include/dbg-thread-syscall.h: 
	* src/dbg-threads-syscall.c:
	Files added to enable support for thread-awareness in GDB stub
	ROMs. The .h file has been moved from kernel/src/debug.

    1999-04-28  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c (__build_t_packet): Changed sp variable to a
	non-pointer type to force it to be installed in the T packet with
	the right size.

	* src/drv_api.c: Added cyg_interrupt_call_pending_DSRs() to keep
	HAL happy in non-kernel configurations.

    1999-04-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h:
	Added VR4300 configury for ROM monitor use and inclusion of
	variant-specific configuration header. This needs some further
	tidying up.
	
1999-04-28  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/PKGconf.mak:
	Use the new rules for generating libextras.a

1999-04-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal.h: GDB_BREAK support now available for ARM
	targets.

	affecting image sizes.

1999-04-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_stub.h: 
	Make sure all functions have C linkage even in C++

1999-04-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>
        PR 19845
	* src/generic-stub.c (__process_packet): Reset _register pointer
	to the exception state before attempting to set up single-step
	magic.

1999-04-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_stub.h: Added declaration for __stub_copy_registers.

	* src/hal_stub.c: Use HAL_xCACHE_IS_ENABLED if defined.

1999-04-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_stub.c:
