	* src/hal_diag.c: Only avoid SERIAL0 if CYG_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR_CYGMON
	since we default to assuming Cygmon

	* include/variant.inc (hal_memc_init): Don't make conditional on

	of memory in system
	(hal_memc_init_dram): Likewise

	rather than relying on this being an expression which evaluates

	This set of changes with matching ones in arch comes from Mark
	Salter's work to make jmr3904 CygMon talk Ethernet.

	interrupts if RAM start, this stops networked CygMon working.
	Likewise don't re-init memory.

	* src/hal_diag.c: Add alternate hal_diag...() routines that talk
	via CygMon so that ethernet debugging works.

	* include/var_arch.h: If CYG_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR, export macro for
	polling unknown interrupts in CygMon, HAL_DIAG_IRQ_CHECK.

	Some code rearranged to eliminate assembler warning messages.
	Some general tidying.

	label after disable to avoid potential race with cache. Suggested
	by Toshiba in PR20091.

	* include/var_intr.h: Added TX39 specific variant of
	HAL_CLOCK_LATENCY().

	* src/mips_tx39.ld: Suppress .mdebug in the final output.

1999-06-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mips_tx39.ld:

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_diag_write_char): Tidied away defunct code

	* src/var_misc.c: Added definition of hal_interrupt_level[].

	* include/variant.inc:

	Added these files. They contain stuff that was previously in the
	jmr3904 platform files.

	* src/PKGconf.mak (COMPILE): Added variant.S

1999-05-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	Imported whole directory tree into main trunk of repository.

	* src/var_misc.c: 
	Changed references to "imp" and "implementation" to "var" and
	"variant" respectively.

	* include/var_arch.h

1999-04-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/imp_cache.h: Move cache enables and disables here from
	hal_cache.h since they are tx39 specific.
