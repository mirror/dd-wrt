2004-04-22  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	 * cdl/hal_mips_vr4300.cdl :
	 Invoke tail with stricter syntax that works in latest coreutils. 

2003-04-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* src/mips_vr4300.ld: 
	Added libsupc++.a to GROUP() directive for GCC versions later than
	3.0.

2001-12-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/variant.inc: Add ifdef around cache clearing code to
	only do this in non-RAM-startup configurations. If this is done in
	a RAM-startup configuration, it can play merry havoc with the
	state of things like RedBoot's network stack.
	We now assume, for RAM applications, that our loader has
	initialized the cache.

2001-10-12  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/mips_vr4300.ld (SECTION_rom_vectors): Updated this section
	to make ROM startup work.
	Note: this still does not fix all ROM startup problems, since the
	ROM is still too slow to execute code from at anything like a
	relistic speed.

2001-10-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_mips_vr4300.cdl: Define endianness in platform CDL instead.

2001-09-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/mips_vr4300.ld: Added .2ram sections to data section needed
	for FLASH support.

2001-09-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/variant.inc: Added definition of INITIAL_SR_VAR.

	* include/var_arch.h (CYG_HAL_GDB_REG): Returned GDB registers to
	full 64bit width.

	* cdl/hal_mips_vr4300.cdl: Added endianness configuration.
	Currently the VRC4373 platform is big endian for historical
	reasons, while the VRC4375 platform is little endian.
	
2000-09-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/var_arch.h (CYG_HAL_GDB_REG): vr4300 GDB stubs now use 
	32-bits internally to represent registers

2000-06-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mips_vr4300.ld:
	Switched to new table definition mechanism.

2000-02-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/var_cache.h: Don't need to conditionalize on vr4300

2000-02-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_mips_vr4300.cdl: removed fix me

2000-01-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mips_vr4300.ld: Add support for network package.

2000-01-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_mips_vr4300.h:
	Added define for CYGHWR_HAL_MIPS_64BIT so that all vr4300 targets
	save and restore 64 bit register values.

	* cdl/hal_mips_vr4300.cdl:
	Added option for CYGHWR_HAL_MIPS_64BIT so that all vr4300 targets
	save and restore 64 bit register values.

1999-12-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_mips_vr4300.cdl: Some cosmetic layout changes and fixed typos
	Ensure we "puts" to correct CDL header

1999-12-02  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_mips_vr4300.cdl:

	Use the <PACKAGE> token in custom rules.

1999-12-01  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_mips_vr4300.cdl:

	Use the <PREFIX> token in custom rules.

1999-11-04  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_mips_vr4300.cdl:

	Output custom rule dependency information to .deps files in
	the current directory.

	Dispense with the need to create a 'src' sub-directory.

1999-11-02  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_mips_vr4300.cdl: Added.

1999-10-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/var_cache.h: The single nop added on 10-21 seems to
	cause exceptions on the vrc4373 board but not on others. Extended
	this to three nops, which seem to work on all boards.

1999-10-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/var_intr.h: Removed superfluous placeholder ifdef.

1999-10-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/var_cache.h: Added an extra nop after reading the
	config0 register. In some boards we get an exception when reloading
	it if we don't have this here. Something to do with coprocessor
	hazards.

1999-10-06  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/PKGconf.mak: Don't create extras.o here any more

1999-10-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/PKGconf.mak: Switched link command for libextras over to big
	endian.

	* include/pkgconf/hal_mips_vr4300.h: Added definition of
	CYGPKG_HAL_MIPS_MSBFIRST.

	* include/variant.inc: Set BE bit in config0 register depending on
	definitions of CYGPKG_HAL_MIPS_[L|M]SBFIRST.

1999-09-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mips_vr4300.ld:
	Extended size of .rom_vectors section to 0x800 bytes for ROMRAM
	startup so that when it is copied down into RAM, the VSR and
	vector tables are zeroed automatically.

	* include/variant.inc:
	Moved cache macros here so that code to initialize the caches is
	variant specific.

1999-09-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mips_vr4300.ld: Discard debug vector - it doesn't exist on the
	vr4300

1999-08-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/variant.inc: VR4300 is a mips 3 processor, so always allow
	mips3 instructions

1999-07-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/variant.inc: Rename CYG_HAL_MIPS_FSR_INIT to
	CYG_HAL_MIPS_FCSR_INIT since that's closer to its documented name

1999-07-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/var_cache.h: Define HAL_ICACHE_IS_ENABLED() to be the same
	as HAL_DCACHE_IS_ENABLED()

1999-06-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/variant.inc:
	Added initializer for FPU FSR register.

1999-06-17  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/var_cache.h: Added defines to disable generic code for
	cache lock support in hal_cache.h. The vr4300 does not have cache
	locking.

1999-06-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mips_vr4300.ld: Removed below workaround.

1999-06-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>
        CR 100804 workaround
	* src/mips_vr4300.ld:  Suppress .mdebug in the final output.

1999-05-28  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mips_vr4300.ld:
	Removed references to CYG_HAL_STARTUP_STUBS

1999-05-27  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/var_cache.h (HAL_DCACHE_IS_ENABLED): Added an
	implementation of this macro.

1999-05-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/var_misc.c (hal_variant_init): Added enables for caches.

	* src/mips_vr4300.ld: Added definition of SECTION_rom_vectors()
	for ROMRAM and STUBS startups.

	* include/variant.inc: Added an initial value for config0.

	* include/var_cache.h: Added enable and disable macros for data
	and instruction caches.

1999-05-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	Imported whole directory tree into main trunk of repository.
