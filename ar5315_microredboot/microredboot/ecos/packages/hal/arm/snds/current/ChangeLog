	* include/hal_diag.h: hal_delay_us() is a C function.

2003-11-05  Roland Caﬂebohm  <roland.cassebohm@visionsystems.de>

        * include/plf_io.h: Define HAL_IO_MACROS_NO_ADDRESS_MUNGING to
        force the IO macros not to mung the addresses. This platform
        don't need this.

2003-10-08  Roland Caﬂebohm  <roland.cassebohm@visionsystems.de>

        * include/plf_io.h: Correct (unused) defines for
        KS32C_ROMCON_BASE_MASK, KS32C_ROMCON_NEXT_MASK, 
        KS32C_DRAMCON_BASE_MASK and KS32C_DRAMCON_NEXT_MASK.

	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm: 
	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm:  Adjust for changes in RedBoot
	template - DNS now must be enabled manually.

2003-07-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_snds.cdl:
        Changed values for CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_NUMERATOR,
        CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_DENOMINATOR and CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_PERIOD to
        "default_value" from "calculated". This makes it easier
        to change these values globally.
        
2002-10-19  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_SETUP1): Only define if
	ROM or ROMRAM, not if STUBS which can be RAM.

2003-02-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@calivar.com>

	* include/plf_io.h (CYGARC_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS): Added this
	definition to keep redboot_linux_exec.c happy.

	Standardize CYGNUM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_CONSOLE_CHANNEL_DEFAULT usage.

2001-12-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_SETUP1): Don't trust the
	syscfg SDRAM request bit as suggested by manual - always set it to
	what works. Use relative loads to get a pointer to the tables with
	system controller setup data.

	* src/snds100_misc.c: Don't mess up the syscfg register.

2001-10-19  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/plf_io.h (KS32C_REFEXTCON): Split in DRAM and SDRAM
	settings.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Fix KS32C_REFEXTCON parameters,
	and set some LEDs to help debugging.

	* cdl/hal_arm_snds.cdl: On the SNDS100 board the CPU runs at
	50MHZ.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_snds_rom.ldi: Moved flash to
	0x01800000.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_snds_rom.mlt: Same.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_snds_rom.h: Same.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Added LED macro. Use relative
	branch in reset vector. Moved flash to 0x01800000.

2001-10-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Definition names updated.
	* src/snds100_misc.c: Same.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_snds_rom.ldi: Added.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_snds_rom.mlt: Same.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_snds_rom.h: Same.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_snds_ram.ldi: Updated layout.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_snds_ram.mlt: Same.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_snds_ram.h: Same.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Fixed instruction typo.

	* include/hal_platform_ints.h: Vector definitions renamed to match
	those in E7T HAL.

	* include/hal_cache.h: Replaced with E7T HAL version.

	* cdl/hal_arm_snds.cdl: Added default baud rate option, ROM
	startup mode, and removed PID tools make rules.

2001-10-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Copied here from E7T HAL.
	* src/snds100_misc.c: Functions replaced with E7T HAL
	versions.

	* include/plf_io.h: Added.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_SETUP1): Code matching
	board mon.

	* include/hal_cache.h: Don't define cache dimensions at all rather
	than using 0.

	* src/snds100_misc.c: 
	* src/hal_diag.c: 
	printf() is no longer a part of RedBoot.  Thus all programs
	must use diag_printf() and related functions instead.
