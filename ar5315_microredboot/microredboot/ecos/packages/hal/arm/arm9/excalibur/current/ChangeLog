2003-12-05  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/hal_diag.h: hal_delay_us() is a C function.

2003-07-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_arm9_excalibur.cdl:
        Changed values for CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_NUMERATOR,
        CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_DENOMINATOR and CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_PERIOD to
        "default_value" from "calculated". This makes it easier
        to change these values globally.
        
2003-02-13  Patrick Doyle  <wpd@delcomsys.com>

	avoid problems with newer tools.

2002-04-02  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_arm9_excalibur_redboot.h: Added new
	REDBOOT startup mode that is similar in function to the ROMRAM
	starup mode, with the exception that (RedBoot) application memory
	is linked at 0x07f80000 instead of 0x00008000, thus freeing up
	memory at 0x8000 to applications linked without the correct linker
	map.

2001-12-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/excalibur.h (_MMAP_PLD1_INIT): Changed to 0x0f000000.
	* src/excalibur_misc.c (hal_mmu_init): Added mapping for

	* src/hal_diag.c (cyg_hal_plf_serial_isr): Also use RX int
	workaround here.

	* src/excalibur_misc.c (hal_IRQ_handler): INT_ID doesn't do the
	helpful thing, so decode by steam.

	* cdl/hal_arm_arm9_excalibur.cdl: Disable D-cache again.

2001-08-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/excalibur_misc.c (hal_mmu_init): Don't let flash be cached:
	appears to cause a bus lock when accessed from RAM.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Only copy code when in ROMRAM
	startup configuration.

	* src/excalibur_misc.c (hal_delay_us): Use timer.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Better ROMRAM startup.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_arm9_excalibur_romram.h: Added.

	* src/hal_diag.c: Use RI flag in ISR instead of polling the FIFO
	count register. Appears that FIFO jams on overruns somehow, and
	messes up the ISR state in the process. Try to work around that by
	checking both FIFO count and ISR RI flag. It works. Sort of.

	* src/excalibur_misc.c (hal_delay_us): Do nothing for now. Real
	code changed a bit too. 

	* include/excalibur.h: Fixed typo in FIFO register defs.

	* cdl/hal_arm_arm9_excalibur.cdl: Changed baud rate to 9600 until

	* src/excalibur_misc.c: Added debug code, disable PLD interrupts.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Added some (overkill) delays,
	moved PLD mmap init, do SDRAM init, don't touch unused mmap
	entries. Do DPSRAM init (not that it should make a difference).

	* include/excalibur.h: Fixed mmap sizes. Fixed SDRAM map
	size. Added some debug code. Added DPSRAM defs.

2001-08-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	errors and warnings.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_arm9_excalibur_ram.ldi: Updated.
