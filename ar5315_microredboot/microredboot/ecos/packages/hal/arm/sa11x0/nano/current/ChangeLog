2003-09-21  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* misc/redboot_POST.ecm: 
	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm:  Adjust for changes in RedBoot
	template - DNS now must be enabled manually.

2003-02-13  Patrick Doyle  <wpd@delcomsys.com>
	* src/nano_misc.c: Replaced explicit prototype of memset with
	#include <string.h>.

2002-08-12  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_POST.ecm: Remove CYGSEM_REDBOOT_ARM_LINUX_BOOT.
	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm: Ditto.

2002-05-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/nano_misc.c: Fixed warning.

2002-05-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0_nano.cdl: 
	Standardize CYGNUM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_CONSOLE_CHANNEL_DEFAULT usage.

2002-03-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm: Updated. Added zlib.
	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm: Same.

2002-01-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/nano.h (HAL_PCI_DO_CONFIG_ACCESS): If requesting vendor
	config, check it isn't 0 or 256 which would be bogus - instead
	this indicates the device is absent, e.g. the second eth controller
	that is found on the commEngine, but not on the nanoEngine.

2002-01-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/plf_io.h: Added.

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0_nano.cdl: Remove explicit plf_io.h
	declaration.

2001-05-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/nano_misc.c (hal_mmu_init): Set up PCI memory in the new
	location, where it will not already be mapped by the default
	layout.  This requires "stealing" RAM from the linear layout.
	It's done this way so that a RAM app will work OK atop an
	old-style RedBoot with the old PCI window area set up.
	(hal_arm_mem_real_region_top): Better comments, and a safety
	check; do not repeat the test for boundary movement.
	
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_sa11x0_nano_ram.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_sa11x0_nano_ram.h: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_sa11x0_nano_ram.mlt: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_sa11x0_nano_post.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_sa11x0_nano_post.h: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_sa11x0_nano_post.mlt: 
	Add "fixed" region to contain PCI window at 0xfa00000 (250Mb),
	well away from normal memory.  Adjust ram region size to 15Mb - a
	smaller possible memory installation, with the 1Mb default PCI
	window removed.

2001-04-27  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0_nano.cdl: Remove redundant -Wl,-N from link flags

2001-04-12  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/nano_misc.c (hal_arm_mem_real_region_top): Also report
	variants on the CYGMEM_SECTION_heap1 as described by default.
	This is ugly, but necessary, else the heap tries to use memory
	that is not installed.  Oh, for a proper MLT!

2001-04-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* misc/readme.txt: Update the readme to reflect more info about
	using the nano target.

2001-03-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/nano_misc.c (hal_mmu_init): Find the real physical address
	for mapping the uncacheable, unbufferable PCI window - it might be
	various places depending on what SDRAMs are installed.

2001-03-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/nano.h (HAL_PCI_INIT): Disconnect the two ethernet
	devices from the PCI bus during init so that we can re-scan during
	startup regardless of what happened before - such as
	network-enabled RedBoot doing the same setup already.

	* misc/redboot_POST.ecm: 
	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm: 
	Enable package CYGPKG_IO_ETH_DRIVERS so that RedBoot is network
	capable.  Disable CYGPKG_DEVS_ETH_ARM_NANO_ETH1 so that it uses
	only the first ether device.  Tidy some comments and whitespace.

2001-03-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0_nano.cdl:  Removed
	CYGINT_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_SUPPORT_GUARANTEED which is now the
	default.

2001-03-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_sa11x0_nano_post.h:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_sa11x0_nano_post.ldi:	
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_sa11x0_nano_post.mlt:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_sa11x0_nano_ram.h:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_sa11x0_nano_ram.ldi:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_sa11x0_nano_ram.mlt:
	Add MLT definition of PCI window.
	I chose 0x1e00000 ie. megabyte 30 because I believe
	megabyte 31 is used by RedBoot for buffers or stacks.
	
	* include/nano.h: Take external MLT definition of PCI window for
	defining BASE, SIZE symbols.  Set the interrupts on GPIO0 and
	GPIO1 to be falling-edge in HAL_PCI_INIT().  Don't define any of
	this unless CYGPKG_IO_PCI and not assembler.

	* src/nano_misc.c (hal_mmu_init): Take external MLT definition of
	PCI window.  Also define and initialize an int holding the real
	address of the PCI window, if CYGPKG_IO_PCI.

2001-02-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/plf_mmap.h (HAL_VIRT_TO_PHYS_ADDRESS): [et al] Use
	variant HAL routines which scan the true memory map installed.
	This is necessary for dealing with eg. PCI window - also future
	similar targets with different physical memory arrangements,

	* src/nano_misc.c (plf_hardware_init): Perform MMU initialization
	even in RAM startup - so that different configurations of
	ROM(RedBoot) and RAM app can work together.
	(hal_mmu_init): Perform partial initialization when in RAM startup
	- so that ROM settings can be overridden eg. for PCI non-cacheable
	memory windows and the like.  [Incomplete initial version.]

	* include/nano.h (HAL_PCI_INIT): Implement this and all its mates,
	ie. a PCI device driver for the nanoBridge and *very specifically*
	its two attached i82559s only - it's by no means general, because
	it's not a proper implementation of a PCI bridge.

2001-02-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_POSTecm: 
	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm: add configuration of the Flash Image
	System initialization in RedBoot.

2001-02-20  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0_nano.cdl: New CDL describing serial
	ports - CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_SA11X0_UART1,3.

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0_nano.cdl: Also changed the default baud rates
	to 38400, having realized that the other port works just fine too.
	So you can put your serial line on the non-BSE port for normal
	work and not be hassled by out-of-time characters over reset.

2001-02-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_POST.ecm: 
	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm:
	Add CYGPKG_IO_FLASH for RedBoot builds now that flash driver
	exists.   CYGPKG_DEVS_FLASH_NANO + CYGPKG_DEVS_FLASH_STRATA

2001-02-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Clean up debug and cache hacks to
	get it limping along.  Import proper value (as read from system
	regs) to SDRAM controller setup - in case true ROM startup is ever
	used.

	* src/nano_misc.c (hal_arm_mem_real_region_top): Add.  Support
	hal_dram_size.
	(hal_mmu_init): Add a SDRAM sizer like others we have.  Just in
	case.  Deals with 32Mb sized parts also.

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0_nano.cdl: implements
	CYGINT_HAL_ARM_MEM_REAL_REGION_TOP

2001-02-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* hal/arm/sa11x0/nano: New package, based on Assabet 
	HAL.  This is the nanoEngine from Bright Star Engineering; an
	SA1110 CPU + 2x i82559 ethernets.
