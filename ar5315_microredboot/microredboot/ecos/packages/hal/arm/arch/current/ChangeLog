2004-10-07  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/arm_stub.c (target_ins): Added a cast to prevent a compiler
	warning.

2004-09-02  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl (CYGHWR_REDBOOT_LINUX_EXEC_X_SWITCH): New
	option used to enable "-x" option to exec command.
	
	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c (do_exec): Add support for booting
	kernels built for endianess oppposite of RedBoot.

2004-07-07  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c (do_exec): Fix test for valid entry
	(was being overwritten by command line parameter)

2004-05-27  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c (do_exec): Be sensitive to value in
	"entry_address" as this can indicate if the image to be executed
	is valid (the "load" functions set it to "NO_MEMORY" when invalid)

2004-05-24   Ian Campbell <icampbell@arcom.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c: __mem_fault_handler: Only do this if we have
	CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INCLUDE_STUBS. This allows the HAL to be 
	compiled without stubs.

2004-04-22  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	 * cdl/hal_arm.cdl :
	 Invoke tail with stricter syntax that works in latest coreutils. 

2003-11-05  Roland Caﬂebohm  <roland.cassebohm@visionsystems.de>

        * include/hal_io.h: If defined HAL_IO_MACROS_NO_ADDRESS_MUNGING
        use macros which don't mung the addresses even if the platform
        is big-endian. Platforms which don't need address munging can
        just define HAL_IO_MACROS_NO_ADDRESS_MUNGING in plf_io.h .
 
2003-10-23  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Acknowlege spurious interrupts.

2003-10-13  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Fixed broken thumb mode exception handling.

2003-06-30  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Fix CYGOPT_HAL_ARM_PRESERVE_SVC_SPSR handling.

2003-06-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h: Include plf_arch.h or var_arch.h if platform
	or variant requires it to do overrides.
	(HAL_IDLE_THREAD_ACTION): Default to empty statement but allow to be
	overridden.
	
	* src/hal_misc.c: Remove hal_idle_thread_action. It's no use.

2003-05-06  Pierre Habraken  <Pierre.Habraken@imag.fr>

	* src/arm_stub.c (target_ins, target_thumb_ins): Added code to
	enable stepping into swi instructions.
	
	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Added option CYGOPT_HAL_ARM_PRESERVE_SVC_SPSR for
	securing exception and breakpoint processing triggered during
	execution of application specific SWI handlers. Added option
	CYGOPT_HAL_ARM_WITH_USER_MODE for supporting programs running in
	user mode.
	* src/vectors.S (return_from_exception): Added code to exception
	handling for preserving svc spsr before returning to svc mode.
	Added code to allow exceptions in user mode.
	(call_exception_handler, handle_IRQ_or_FIQ): Added code to allow
	exceptions in user mode.
	* include/hal_arch.h: Defined CPSR_USER_MODE.
	* src/hal_mk_defs.c.: Added definition for CPSR_USER_MODE.

2003-04-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/vectors.S (handle_IRQ_or_FIQ): Tweak below to be conditional on
	__thumb__.

2003-04-26  Daniel NÈri  <daniel.neri@sigicom.se>

	* vectors.S (handle_IRQ_or_FIQ):
	Use thumb-aware call to hal_spurious_IRQ.

2003-04-13  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/vectors.S (start): fix build problem with -mthumb

2003-03-11  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c (do_exec): Call eth_drv_stop as necessary.

2003-02-13  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c (do_exec): Add missing semicolon.

2003-02-13  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c (CYGHWR_REDBOOT_LINUX_ATAG_MEM): 
	Add CYG_MACRO_START/END markers.

2003-02-12  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com> inspired by
2003-02-12  Robin Farine <robin.farine@acn-group.ch>	

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: Allow platform to override memory layout.
	Also, give error if no "-b" option and base/load address unknown.	
2003-02-06  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: Make sure RAM description is sane.

2003-01-31  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_syscall.c (hal_syscall_handler): Let generic syscall code
	handle exit.

2003-01-17  Patrick Doyle  <wpd@delcomsys.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c (do_exec): Round the length up to a
	multiple of 4 so that the copy loop (which decrements the count by
	4 each time through) runs a finite length of time.
	
	Fixed the calculation of params->u.mem.size so that it doesn't
	double the memory size if it is already a power of two.

2003-01-06  Patrick Doyle  <wpd@delcomsys.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c (do_exec): Added support for, and
	changed to use, ATAG_INITRD2 instead of ATAG_INITRD.  ATAG_INITRD
	specifies the virtual address of the ramdisk while ATAG_INITRD2
	specifies the physical address.

2002-12-11  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_io.h: Allow variant or platform HALs to override
	default IO macros.

2002-11-12  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/arm_stub.c (target_ins): Account for PC prefetch when PC is
	source register in data processing insns.

2002-08-29  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Avoid entering thumb mode in exception handlers.

2002-08-27  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/arm.ld: Undefine arm to avoid problem with .note.arm.ident.

2002-08-22  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/arm.ld: Add .note.arm.ident section used by tools to identify
	architecture variants.

2002-08-21  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/arm_stub.c: Add support for large registers (e.g. FPU).
	* include/arm_stub.h: Add infrastructure for support of coprocessors.
	* include/hal_arch.h: Ditto.

2002-08-02  Andrew Lunn <Andrew.Lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Redboot exec command can now be disabled by CDL
	
2002-07-15  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* include/arm_stub.h: Comment out NUMREGBYTES.

2002-05-28  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Tweaked description for
	CYGHWR_REDBOOT_ARM_LINUX_EXEC_ADDRESS.
	Add CYGHWR_REDBOOT_ARM_LINUX_TAGS_ADDRESS.

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c (do_exec): Rework transition to MMU
	off and jump to kernel so that it works for non 1-1 mapped
	platforms.

2002-05-20  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_io.h: Fix ...STRING macros - not using index.
	Pointed out by Thomas Koeller <thomas@koeller.dyndns.org>.

2002-05-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (handle_IRQ_or_FIQ): Save SVC mode LR in interrupt
	handling as well as exceptions.

	* src/context.S (hal_thread_switch_context): Use correct size
	for skipping new HAL_SavedRegisters fields.
	
2002-05-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Remove -malignment-traps here - add it only from
	packages when needed.

2002-05-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Added code to save and restore value of SVC mode
	LR during exception processing. If the exception comes from a
	non-SVC mode then handling it originally corrupted the SVC mode
	LR. If the program subsequent returned to SVC mode it was likely
	to have problems. The registers for modes other than SVC and the
	exception mode are not touched, so we do not have to save/restore
	those.

	* src/hal_mk_defs.c: Added definitions for armreg_r10 and
	armreg_svclr.

	* include/hal_arch.h: Added svc_lr field to HAL_SavedRegisters to
	save SVC mode link register during exception handling.

2002-04-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Forcibly add -malignment-traps to the compiler
	options to work around problem with recent compiler. This can be
	removed when the tools are respun.

2002-04-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S:
	Don't use .file as it can confuse debugging since the .file
	doesn't contain the path and therefore the debugger will never
	know where it lives! This conflicts with using -Wa,--gstabs.

2002-04-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Safer clearing of BSS.

2002-04-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_syscall.c (hal_syscall_handler): Add extra sig argument to
	__do_syscall.

2002-04-15  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Rewrite exception handling to allow exceptions
	in any privileged mode.
	* src/hal_mk_defs.c (main): Add some regs.
	* include/hal_arch.h (HAL_SavedRegisters): Slight rearrangement.
	* src/context.S (hal_thread_switch_context): Use new context layout.
	(hal_thread_load_context): Ditto.

2002-04-11  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/arm.ld: Fixed .sbss rule.

2002-04-10  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/arm.ld: Define .gnu.linkonce sections properly.
	Remove sbss from data section.

2002-03-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Use interrupt stack during system initialzation
	if configured since this stack will be much larger than the default
	idle thread stack.  Some configurations (think networking) may use
	lots of stack space during system startup and the assumption that
	the idle thread stack does not need much space fails miserably.

2002-02-19  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/arm_stub.c (target_thumb_ins): Check architecture version
	to decide how to handle pop insn.
	(v5T_semantics): New function. Returns true for v5 and later.

2002-02-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/arm_stub.c (target_thumb_ins): The result of a POP
	instruction changing the PC must be the address of a THUMB
	instruction.

2002-01-29  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: Include hal_io.h instead of CRUFT_H.
	(do_exec): Add nops after loop copying trampoline code. Removed
	one argument to the assembly: code only works if virt==phys
	mapping anyway. This should be rewritten to be safe for all
	possible targets.

2002-01-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_io.h: Include var_io.h if present, otherwise include
	plf_io.h. This makes the ARM HAL match the other HALs better in
	this regard, allowing platform IO definitions to override variant
	IO definitions while allowing sharing code between platforms of
	the same variant.

2002-01-25  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Added RedBoot options.
	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: Added generic version of the RedBoot
	exec command to be shared by all ARM platforms. Still needs some
	cleaning up after CYGARC_ memory macros find their proper home.

2002-01-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl (CYGOPT_HAL_ARM_SYSCALL_GPROF_SUPPORT): New
	option, implements CYGINT_REDBOOT_BSP_SYSCALLS_GPROF_SUPPORT so
	RedBoot knows we can do this.  Only active if indeed we can.

	* include/hal_arch.h (HAL_GET_PROFILE_INFO): New macro, to extract
	the interrupted PC and SP from a struct HAL_SavedRegisters.  Used
	for histogram-style profiling.

2001-11-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/arm_stub.h (CYG_HAL_GDB_LEAVE_CRITICAL_IO_REGION): Nasty
	bodge to fix a tools issue where an "unused" label is migrated to
	where some real code is, ie. the wrong place in this case.
	Problem applies to arm9e-elf tools and other arm variants also.

2001-10-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/arm.ld (SECTION_rom_vectors): Define symbols used for ROMRAM
	startup; for some reason these were not in the trunk.  They are:
	__rom_vectors_vma and __rom_vectors_lma

2001-10-24  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_msbindex): Fix calculation.

2001-10-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_mmu.h (MMU_Control_Z,F,RR): Some extra defines for
	newer ARM architectures.

2001-10-11  Fabrice Gautier  <Fabrice_Gautier@sdesigns.com>

	* include/hal_io.h: Add _STRING variants of I/O macros to allow
	writing of consecutive items to the same registers.

2001-10-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h: Remove CYG_HAL_TABLE_BEGIN and CYG_HAL_TABLE_END
	as the common versions are acceptable.

2001-10-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/arm.ld: Make separate section for GOT and .eh_frame.
	Make macro section for all reloc sections.
	Input extras.o unconditionally.
	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Don't bother with -DEXTRAS=1 - unconditional now.

2001-08-24  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/arm_stub.c (target_thumb_ins): Add support for pop insn.

2001-08-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Only define HAL_CLOCK_LATENCY() if it's not
	defined already (if it's needed at all).  This is for platforms
	which need a separate routine, such as sa11x0.

2001-07-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Support ROMRAM startup mode.  Note: most of
	the support for this mode will be in the platform setup code.

2001-07-18  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_mk_defs.c (main): FIQ no longer listed as an exception.

2001-07-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Define range of exceptions more accurately.

2001-07-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c (exception_handler): Allow memory faults to be
	caught, even when GDB stubs are not included.

2001-06-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/arm_stub.h (NUMREGBYTES): Define - this tells GDB how 
	large it's communications buffers need to be.

2001-06-05  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>
2001-06-05  Thomas F‰hnle <thomas.faehnle@tst-ag.de>

	* src/vectors.S (spurious_IRQ): Better handling of spurious ints.
	Pass register frame to handler.

2001-05-23  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Allow platforms to define a 'preamble' which gets
	included _before_ the vectors.  This is often required for modules
	which are run from ROM/Flash.

2001-04-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (__exception_handlers): Platforms must explicitly 
	define CYGSEM_HAL_ROM_RESET_USES_JUMP if required.

2001-04-27  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Platforms without CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_HAS_MMU defined
	require that the reset jump be straight up to ROM.  So you can't
	just use a local branch.  This is needed to make RedBoot in the
	EBSA285 work, for example.

2001-04-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Fix typo for ARM9 systems.

2001-04-18  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Add new flag 'CYG_HAL_ROM_RESET_USES_JUMP' to control
	how RESET is handled.  This is normally set for ROM applications, but
	can be overridden by platform code for situations when it is unsuitable
	to have a branch as the RESET instruction.

2001-04-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Add new interfaces to describe CPU family and
	option possiblities.

2001-04-07  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/arm_stub.c: Add support for v5T BLX insn.

2001-03-30  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (__exception_handlers): Don't use relative branch
	for reset on iq80310.

2001-03-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (__GDB_stack_base): Increase stubs stack size to
	"enough".  We tend to have either RedBoot (with no interrupt
	stack) or an app (with no stubs stack) these days, so I used
	CYGNUM_HAL_COMMON_INTERRUPTS_STACK_SIZE.  It defaults to 4k in
	RedBoot which is enough compared to the previous hard-wired 1k.
	The overflow occurred in RedBoot, with i82559 ether driver, during
	GDB connection - but manifested as "network stack out of buffers"
	because of a recursion in trying to report a trap.

2001-02-24  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_mmu.h (MMU_Control_X): Add - used by Win/CE.

	* src/vectors.S (__exception_handlers): Change RESET vector
	to use jump for ROM based applications [safer].
	(warm_reset): Only do 'swi' contortions when starting RAM
	applications from Angel.

2001-02-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/arm.ld: Relocate .2ram sections to the .data section.

2001-02-20  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Added CYGBLD_ARM_ENABLE_THUMB_INTERWORK.

2001-02-13  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (handle_IRQ_or_FIQ): Change behaviour for
	handling spurious interrupts.

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_spurious_IRQ): New function - called
	when a spurious interrupt is detected.  Defined as "weak"
	so platforms can provide localized support.

	* src/hal_mk_defs.c: 
	* include/hal_intr.h (CYGNUM_HAL_INTERRUPT_NONE): Define.

2001-02-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (UNMAPPED()): Handle CYGHWR_HAL_ROM_VADDR if so
	defined; this is used when compiling for a different location from
	the base of ROM.  hal_platform_setup.h might define it.  For
	example, if flash is from 0x50000000 upwards (as on SA11x0), and
	we are to execute at 0x50040000, then we want the reset vector to
	point to 0x0004pqrs - the unmapped ROM address of the code -
	rather than 0x0000pqrs, which is the offset into our flash block.
	But usually it's not defined, so the behaviour is the obvious.

2001-02-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/arm_vv.h: Removed again, compiler does magic to thumb
	function pointers.
	* include/hal_arch.h: Same.

2001-02-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/arm_vv.h: Added virtual vector accessor macros that will
	properly mangle function pointers in thumb mode.
	* include/hal_arch.h: Include arm_vv.h
	* src/vectors.S: ctrlc_init can be called for thumb now (but
	requires ROM monitor to be built with -mthumb-interwork)

2001-02-02  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/arm_stub.c (__arm_breakinst): New ARM breakpoint insn.
	(__thumb_breakinst): New thumb breakpoint insn.
	(__is_bsp_syscall): Check for actual SWI number and support
	thumb.

	* include/hal_arch.h (HAL_BREAKINST_ADDR): New macro to provide
	address of correct breakpoint insn of the given length.

2001-02-01  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c: Don't use diag_printf directly (rely on tracing
	macros).

2001-01-31  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (FIQ): Fix broken fiq handling.

2001-01-31  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl:  Get rid of CYGDBG_HAL_DIAG_DISABLE_GDB_PROTOCOL
	options. They are replaced by the
	CYGSEM_HAL_DIAG_MANGLER option.

2001-01-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (init_flag): Add explicit alignment, just in case.
	From Ilko Iliev <iliev@caretec.at>

2001-01-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (hal_dram_size): Create hal_dram_type in memory at
	0x44, right after hal_dram_size.

	* include/hal_intr.h: Add an extern for the word at 0x44, named
	hal_dram_type (as in hal_dram_size).  This can be used for
	platform HALs to know how to decode VIRT_TO_PHYS addresses and
	vice versa.

2000-12-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Handle variant-, and possible overriding
	platform-, specific interrupt files <cyg/hal/hal_platform_ints.h>.
	This is to simplify the multiple SA11x0 targets which have no
	variation there.	

2000-12-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (warm_reset): 'hal_dram_size' is now only set in
	platform code - no need to mess with (pure pollution) it here.

2000-11-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_io.h: Use CYGBLD_HAL_PLATFORM_IO_H for those platforms
	which define it (relieves this file of messy includes).

2000-11-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/basetype.h: Define LABEL mangling macros.

	* include/arch.inc: Added.

2000-11-06  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_syscall.c: New file. Arm interface to redboot's
	handler for GNUPro based application library syscalls.

	* src/arm_stub.c (__is_bsp_syscall): New function. Return
	true if exception caused by bsp SWI.

	* include/arm_stub.h: Add declaration for __is_bp_syscall.

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Add hal_syscall.c to compile list.

2000-11-04  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_io.h: Include cyg/hal/plf_io.h for IQ80310.

	* src/arm_stub.c (__computeSignal): New interface for
	HAL_STUB_IS_STOPPED_BY_HARDWARE

2000-10-27  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/arm_stub.c: Removed uneccesary include.

	* src/vectors.S (start): Fix use of registers which may have
	been destroyed by an LED macro.

2000-10-26  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/arm_stub.c (__computeSignal): Add hook for platforms to
	check for hw watchpoint/breakpoint events.
	(__install_breakpoints): Support HAL breakpoint list.
	(__clear_breakpoints): Ditto.

	* include/hal_arch.h (HAL_BREAKINST_TYPE): Define. Needed by
	hw watchpoint/breakpoint support in stub.

2000-10-20  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c: Update __mem_fault_handler declaration.

2000-09-05  Andrew Lunn <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/basetype.h: Override the alignment macros for the ARM
	architecture. The ARM compiler only alows a maximum of 4 bytes
	of alignment where as the default is 8
	
2000-08-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm.ld (SECTION_text): Change it back so that
	infra/... range checking can see them.  _stext and _etext as seen
	from C are the eventual destination, so this is a step in the
	right direction.  You must hack if building redboot, for now.

2000-08-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm.ld (SECTION_text): Change to stext and etext unadorned
	with underlines so that RedBoot can see them.

2000-08-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h: 
	* src/arm.ld: Changes to support new [anonymous] tables.

2000-07-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (start): Hack to allow thumb tests to run in farm
	until vector table Thumb/ARM API is fixed.

2000-07-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/arm_stub.c: Changes to support CygMon changes.

2000-07-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c: 
	* src/vectors.S:
	All platforms now has VECTOR_SUPPORT (or provide alternative
	implementations). Removed checks for the option.

2000-07-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Add CYGINT_HAL_ARM_MEM_REAL_REGION_TOP
	interface

	* include/hal_intr.h: If the platform implements the
	CYGINT_HAL_ARM_MEM_REAL_REGION_TOP interface, define a new
	HAL_MEM_REAL_REGION_TOP macro appropriately

2000-06-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_mk_defs.c:
	* src/arm_stub.c: 
	Fix compiler warnings.

2000-06-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_arch.h:
	Added local variants of CYG_HAL_TABLE_BEGIN() and
	CYG_HAL_TABLE_END() since the ARM assembler implements some of
	this code with a slightly different syntax to all the other
	targets.

	* include/basetype.h:
	Removed definition of CYG_LABEL_NAME(). Now dealt with by default
	definition in cyg_type.h.
	
	* src/hal_misc.c: 
	* src/arm_stub.c:
	Removed use of CYG_LABEL_NAME(), added underscore to _breakinst.

	Switched over to new table creation mechanism.	

2000-06-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Changes for virtual vector support.
	(hal_virtual_vector_table): Need to protect if virtual vector
	stuff not defined.

	* src/hal_mk_defs.c: Add symbols for virtual vector table.

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_arch_default_isr): New function.  Used in
	place of 'hal_default_isr' if virtual vector support is enabled.

	* include/hal_intr.h: "Fixed" items now exported in 'vectors.S'

	* src/vectors.S: Add notion of "fixed vectors" to all platforms.

2000-06-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h (CYGARC_HAL_SAVE_GP, CYGARC_HAL_RESTORE_GP):
	Added.

2000-06-04  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	which may need to end up in predefined memory locations.
	* src/arm.ld: Add separate 'fixed_vectors' section.

2000-06-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_mmu.h (MMU_Control_I): Added for StrongARM support.

2000-04-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/arm_stub.h (CYG_HAL_GDB_ENTER_CRITICAL_IO_REGION): Only
	use this complex version if we have
	CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_BREAK_SUPPORT ie. the place_break &c routines
	existed anyway.  This is an artificial limitation, somewhat, but
	not so painful in reality.

2000-04-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/context.S: 
	* src/vectors.S: 
	Wrap the trivial thumb stuff in macros so the important bits stand
	out.
	Fix dumb bug.
	
2000-03-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/arm_stub.c: Make place_break thumb-aware.

	* include/arm_stub.h (CYG_HAL_GDB_ENTER_CRITICAL_IO_REGION): 
	Thumb-aware definition.

	and CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_ICE_THREAD_SUPPORT
	options from include/pkgconf/hal_arm.h

2000-02-01  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Treat ROM startup+ROM monitor as STUBS startup.

	* src/arm.ld: Changed PID BE workaround to work with ROM startup.
	Not just when building stubs.
	
2000-01-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm.ld: Add new section 'netdevtab' used to support
	network device initialization.

2000-01-26  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/hal_misc.c (exception_handler): Replace CYGDAT_CYGMON_ENABLE

	* src/arm.ld: Include all SRAM (*.sram*) sections.

1999-12-09  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Add big-endian option.

1999-12-08  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm.ld: Add ".sram" section support (used by platforms
	that have separate SRAM and DRAM).

1999-12-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Added ARM7/ARM9 family option.

1999-12-06  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (software_interrupt): Context save was incorrect
	for this mode.  Note that when entering from supervisor mode, the
	link register (LR) is destroyed.

1999-12-02  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl:

	Use the <PACKAGE> token in custom rules.

1999-12-01  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl:

	Use the <PREFIX> token in custom rules.

1999-11-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm.ld: Add section for definining static MMU tables.

	* src/vectors.S: Introduce PLATFORM_EXTRAS, which if defined provides
	a hook to include platform code in the "vectors.S" file.  In particular,
	some platforms will define this to be <cyg/hal/hal_platform_extras.h> 
	and define static MMU tables there.

1999-11-19  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/basetype.h (CYG_BYTEORDER): If the toolchain tells us to be
	big-endian, be big-endian
	Reported by Grant Edwards

1999-11-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (reset_platform): New function used to reset board
	in the absense of real hardware reset (not possible on all boards).

1999-11-11  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl:

	Generate 'arm.inc' in the build tree.

1999-11-05  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl:

	Add complete dependency analysis to the custom
	rule for 'arm.inc'.

1999-11-04  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl:

	Tidy up custom rules.

1999-11-04  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl:

	Output custom rule dependency information to .deps files in
	the current directory.

	Dispense with the need to create a 'src' sub-directory.

1999-11-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_misc.c (exception_handler): Check for CYGDAT_CYGMON_ENABLE
	rather than just CYGPKG_CYGMON
	Include <pkgconf/cygmon.h> to get this define

1999-10-29 Simon FitzMaurice <sdf@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl:

	Use fgrep instead of grep in custom rules.  The latter seems
	to behave weirdly under win32.

1999-10-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm_stub.c: Fix typo (CYGDAT_CYGMON_ENABLE).  Also need
	to include <pkgconf/cygmon.h>

1999-10-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm_stub.c: Add explicit enable for CygMon package.

1999-10-27  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm_stub.c (cyg_hal_gdb_interrupt): Bugfix to previous: ^Cs
	were being ignored when received by the diag output code, because
	there was already a break in place.  Solution is to let
	cyg_hal_gdb_interrupt() override any previous break, and tidy up
	state of course.

1999-10-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm_stub.c (cyg_hal_gdb_place_break): Add this to the
	ARM-specific GDB stub code.  See hal/common/.../hal_stub for
	details.

1999-10-26  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl:

	Invoke 'sh' version of 'mkdir' explicitly in custom rules.

1999-10-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Cleaned up LED code a bit.

1999-10-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_misc.c (exception_handler): If building for CygMon, defer
	exception processing to it, not here.

	* src/arm_stub.c (__install_breakpoints, __clear_breakpoints): 
	Leave out these [dummy] functions if building CygMon.

	* include/pkgconf/hal_arm.h: Add new configuration option to let
	programs which do not include GDB stubs still process "illegal
	instruction" exceptions.

	* src/vectors.S: Reorder context restore so stack changes are
	protected (interrupts off).

1999-10-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm.ld: Added support for merging RODATA sections into DATA
	* include/hal_io.h: Added BE support.
	
	* src/vectors.S (LED): Added definition for PID board.

1999-10-26  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl:

	Modify custom make rules to specify file paths relative
	to the package version directory.

1999-10-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm_stub.c (cyg_hal_gdb_running_step):
	(cyg_hal_gdb_break_is_set): Provide dummies for these two for now.
	See changelog for hal/common/ hal_stub and generic_stub for info.

1999-10-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_arch.h: Tidy a bit so the breakpoint instruction is only
	defined in one place
	Change thumb breakpoint instruction to 0xbebe

1999-10-18  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl:

	Add cdl_option CYGHWR_THUMB.

1999-10-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>
        From James Ingham <jingham@cygnus.com>:
	* src/PKGconf.mak: Make sed invocation Solaris safe.

1999-10-11  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (reset_vector): Always execute PLATFORM_SETUP1.

1999-10-10  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_arm.h: 
	* src/vectors.S: 
	* src/arm_stub.c: Add thread debug support via Multi-ICE.

1999-10-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm.ld (SECTION_bss): Make *(.bss*) rather than just .bss, to
	cater for nickc's BSS gc improvements.

1999-10-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/basetype.h: Set endian to BE if required.

1999-10-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm.ld: Force output format to BE if required.

1999-09-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Add thumb_func before thumb code where switching
	so GDB/objdump knows how to disassemble it.
	* include/hal_arch.h: Change thumb breakpoint to undefined
	instruction.
	* src/arm_stub.c (target_thumb_ins): Corrected branch offsets.

1999-09-23  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (call_exception_handler): Change on 09-19 messed up
	status register wrt breakpoints, single stepping, etc.

1999-09-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_arch.h: Remove FIXME about GDB register layout.

	* src/context.S (hal_thread_save_context): Change function prologue
	to match APCS more closely (keeps GDB happier).

1999-09-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (spurious_IRQ): Make sure interrupts are masked
	when switching to IRQ mode.

	* src/hal_misc.c (exception_handler): GDB stubs only take over
	memory exceptions.  This allows proper handling when an application
	has it's own IRQ/FIQ VSR.

1999-09-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm.ld: Handle thumb glue sections.

1999-09-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Always include thumb exception support.

1999-09-15  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/context.S: Don't trash r0 which holds the thread's initial
	argument.

	* include/hal_arch.h: 
	* src/arm_stub.c: 
	Added thumb-aware GDB interrupt functions.
	
1999-09-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (undefined_instruction): Adjusted wrong register.
	* src/arm_stub.c (target_thumb_ins): Set thumb flag when required.
	(target_ins): Added BX handling.

	* src/vectors.S:
	* include/hal_arch.h: 
	* src/hal_mk_defs.c:
	* src/arm_stub.c (__single_step): 
	Determine thumb mode by looking at T bit.

1999-09-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm_stub.c (target_thumb_ins): BL is a double instruction.

1999-09-13  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (handle_IRQ_or_FIQ): Allow spurious interrupts
	to be ignored.  Some platforms (CL7xxx) have non-debounced 
	interrupt sources which can vanish before the hardware can be
	queried.

1999-09-11  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm_stub.c (__computeSignal): Synchronise return value with
	what libbsp does and GDB expects
	(__get_trap_number): Don't shift right 8 - it's already the right number

1999-09-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (start): Moved stub vector changeover to after
	stub init.

1999-09-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_arch.h (HAL_BREAKPOINT):
	* src/arm_stub.c:
	* src/vectors.S:
	Added thumb stub support (except C-c support).
	
1999-08-24  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Fix misc THUMB procedures.

1999-08-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@masala.cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (handle_IRQ_or_FIQ): Set up the pointer-to-regset
	in r2 for calling the ISR as well as the DSR.  This is needed for
	the cyg_hal_gdb_isr() for those platforms that handle ^C's
	incoming that way - the ISR needs a regset to know where to plant
	a breakpoint to stop the system in the interrupted context.

1999-08-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (LED): Check XBUS setting jumper and behave
	accordingly.

1999-08-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm_stub.c 
	(target_ins): Check whether branches execute.
	(ins_will_execute): Fixed HI and LS.

1999-08-13  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Add path to CYGBLD_LINKER_SCRIPT value.

1999-08-12  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm.cdl: Define CYGBLD_LINKER_SCRIPT.

1999-08-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_io.h: Include plf_io.h when appropriate.

1999-08-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>
        CR 101032
        * src/vectors.S (handle_IRQ_or_FIQ): Moved setup of register_frame
        argument to just before the interrupt_end call.

1999-07-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (_eCos_id): Remove bogus version string.

1999-07-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_default_isr): Call the special platform HAL
	routine to see whether there is a ^C lurking in the serial device
	through a macro, if it's defined.  Problem is that
	CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT *is* defined for platforms that
	do not support it.

1999-07-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_default_isr): If we are including
	CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT, then poll a special platform
	HAL routine to see whether there is a ^C lurking in the serial
	device.  This has to be done from the default ISR so that others
	(which must know about ^Cs is they are still to be handled) can
	install over the top.  Not all platforms support this, so enabling
	CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT will not necessarily work.

1999-07-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (vectors): Re-organize startup a little to support
	ROMming of the image and stubrom creation.  Withdraw publication
	of cyg_startup_stack; it's necessary to do this a different way,
	using...

	* include/hal_intr.h (hal_dram_size): reserve location 0x40 for
	communicating DRAM size between boot ROMs and app during startup,
	and remembering it within ROM startup.  Platforms that don't need
	this should zero the location.

1999-07-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (cyg_startup_stack): Publish this object for
	passing some DRAM size info around during startup.
	Remove the unused [well, ignored] array hal_vsr_table - the VSR
	table is defined to be at 0x20 by the code here in vectors.S

	* include/hal_intr.h (HAL_VSR_SET): define hal_vsr_table to be at
	0x20 where the hardware vectors actually read VSR entries from.
	Renumber VSR symbols to match.  Do not use the external
	"hal_vsr_table" symbol.

1999-07-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (reset_vector): Invalidate and disable caches for
	EBSA-285 startup is now in PLATFORM_SETUP1 as intended.  Cache
	enabling is in hal_hardware_init; so, same results as before, but
	tidier.

1999-07-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Add some startup debug via a LED macro - which
	has different content depending on platform, of course.
	For the EBSA-285, flush caches when writing vectors and the like,
	since RAM startup occurs with caches enabled, otherwise you get
	mysterious traps as CygMon is entered regardless at the first
	clock tick, for example.  This may be taken out again as ROM
	startup is dealt with via PLATFORM_SETUP1, but for now...

1999-06-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Fix names of 'report' functions (debug dumps
	for various exceptions).  These needed changes for two reasons:
	name pollution and naming clashes after new ABI adopted.
	Improve support for FIQ interrupts.

1999-06-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Add ".pool" directives which cause assembler 
	to dump it's literal pool early.  This is necessary because
	of the limited addressing available in THUMB mode.

1999-06-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (vectors): Some boards have an MMU, but the
	reset vector needs to have an unmapped address!

1999-06-09  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (reset_vector): Streamline ROM/STUBS code.

1999-05-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (_eCos_id): Add version string.  Useful for
	tracking when a system was configured (especially ROMs).
	Add initial pure-thumb support - only for kernel+application
	in thumb mode.
	
	* include/hal_intr.h: Update interrupt support macros for
	thumb mode system.

	* src/context.S: Add initial pure-thumb mode support.

1999-05-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Define HAL_INTERRUPT_STACK_BASE and
	HAL_INTERRUPT_STACK_TOP so that stack usage macros in
	kernel/.../stackmon.hxx can work.

	* src/vectors.S (cyg_interrupt_stack_base): Define this symbol for
	the interrupt stack and its friend for the stack top so that we
	can publish them with nice names.

1999-05-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/arm.ld: Change symbols to match new no-underscore ABI.

1999-05-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Define interrupt support functions for
