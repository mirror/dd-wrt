2004-04-22  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	 * cdl/hal_v85x.cdl :
	 Invoke tail with stricter syntax that works in latest coreutils.

	* src/hal_misc.c: Remove unused __mem_fault_handler declaration.

2001-11-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_msbit_index): Fixed.

2001-04-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Support daft platforms like the CEB which have
	default on-chip flash that vector NMI to 2 insns after reset.
	Also place hal_v85x_ice_syscall_info in fixed location, only
	for ROM/ROMRAM builds.

2001-03-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Overhaul...
	Make interrupt processing path faster, especially by implementing
	CYGDBG_HAL_COMMON_INTERRUPTS_SAVE_MINIMUM_CONTEXT
	Add ROMRAM startup support
	Pass in correct argument to exception_handler
	Call DSRs with parameter flushback area
	Add __allow_nmi as a somewhat kludgy means of determining
	whether NMIs should be ignored - important if the board resets
	and the vector tables are temporarily inconsistent.
	Initialize __vsr_table statically.
	Add some generic elements of ICE debugging support

	* src/v85x.ld: Remove - redundant.

	* src/hal_mk_defs.c (main): Update to reflect new vector names
	(to match official NEC docs)

	* src/hal_misc.c (exception_handler): Remove cygmon cruft.
	(hal_arch_default_isr): Report spurious interrupts.
	(hal_idle_thread_action): use halt instruction

	* include/hal_arch.h: Remove obsolete comment reference to arch.inc.

	* include/basetype.h: No need to include <pkgconf/hal.h>
	* include/hal_io.h: Ditto.
	* include/nec-stub.h: Similarly for <pkgconf/system.h>

	Description tidies.

2001-01-26  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Move HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_RESET and
	HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_RESET_ENTRY here from platform stub headers.
	Also rename to HAL_PLATFORM_RESET and HAL_PLATFORM_RESET_ENTRY

	* src/vectors.S (_hal_reset_board): Renamed from hal_plf_reset_board

2001-01-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Added underscore to reference to
	cyg_scheduler_sched_lock, since CYGBLD_ATTRIB_ASM_ALIAS() now adds
	one automatically.

2000-10-20  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c: Update __mem_fault_handler declaration.

2000-10-16  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

2000-09-13  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: When calling C functions, ensure there is 16 bytes
	space for the parameter flushback area (as per the calling convention)
	on the stack

2000-09-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/basetype.h: Don't need special alignment after all - it was
	a bug elsewhere.

2000-09-06  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/basetype.h: Need special alignment to match the way
	the compiler/linker actually do things.

	* cdl/hal_v85x.cdl: Improve variant handling and specification.

2000-08-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (start): Allow programs to field NMI exceptions.

2000-07-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/basetype.h: Removed definition of CYG_LABEL_NAME().

	* src/v85x.ld: 	Switched to new table definition mechanism.

2000-07-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (_hal_plf_reset_board): Needs to be defined in all
	configurations.

	checks.

2000-06-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: 
	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_default_isr): Update for new debug
	vector support.

	* include/hal_intr.h: 
	* src/vectors.S (do_interrupt): Proper handling of chained
	interrupts.

2000-06-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (return_from_exception_or_interrupt): Revert 
	reorg change (05-26) which broke GDB breakpoints.

2000-06-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h (CYGARC_HAL_SAVE_GP, CYGARC_HAL_RESTORE_GP):
	Added.

2000-05-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Slight reorg of trap vectors (more readable).

2000-05-25  John Dallaway  <jld@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_v85x.cdl: Tidy display strings.

2000-05-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Handle different chips (number of interrupt
	sources differs, exception table is altered, etc).

	* include/hal_intr.h: Actual interrupt layout now defined by
	variant/platform since these differ depending on the chip.

2000-05-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h: New breakpoint instruction ("br *").

2000-04-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c (exception_handler): Proper handling of nested
	[watchdog] interrupts - don't corrupt GDB registers.

	* src/hal_mk_defs.c: Add some symbols required for NMI handling.

	* src/vectors.S (return_from_exception_or_interrupt): 
	Properly handle different cases for exception, NMI and ISR.

	* include/hal_intr.h (HAL_TRANSLATE_VECTOR): Ignore interrupt
	chaining - doesn't happen on this hardware.

2000-04-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (exception): Handle NMI.  In particular, need to
	have appropriate bits set so they clear and also get the state
	from the proper save registers.
	(exception): Register save was wrong - ROM only.

2000-03-31  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_mk_defs.c: Add definition for 'ep' register.

	* include/hal_intr.h: 
	* cdl/hal_nec.cdl: Add config option to choose between inline and
	real functions for interrupt macros.

	* src/vectors.S: Tune up - use SLD/SST for smaller, faster code
	in context load/save routines.  Also remove IRQ trace/debug code.

2000-03-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (do_interrupt): Can't use R13 across function calls.
	This caused instability when turning on kernel instrumentation.

	* include/hal_intr.h: Use out-of-line code for interrupt functions
	for tracing/testing.

	* src/vectors.S: Working support for separate interrupt stack.
	Some debug/trace code left in.

	* src/hal_mk_defs.c: 
	* include/hal_arch.h: Documented API does not match actual GCC 
	register usage. Need to save R1/R2/R4/R5 for setjmp/longjmp.

2000-03-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (do_interrupt): Pass regs to ISR & DSR.

	* include/basetype.h: Endian-ness was incorrect.

	* include/hal_arch.h: 
	* src/hal_mk_defs.c: Complete setjmp/longjmp support.

	* src/vectors.S: Add interrupt stack.

2000-03-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (_hal_plf_reset_board): Add board reset function.

	* include/hal_arch.h (CYGHWR_TEST_PROGRAM_EXIT): Define RESET for ROM
	based programs.
