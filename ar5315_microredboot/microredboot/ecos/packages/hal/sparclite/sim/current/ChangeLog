2003-07-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* cdl/hal_sparclite_sim.cdl:
        Changed values for CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_NUMERATOR,
        CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_DENOMINATOR and CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_PERIOD to
        "default_value" from "calculated". This makes it easier
        to change these values globally.
        
2000-10-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sim_ram.mlt:
	Add heap1 section

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sim_ram.h:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sim_ram.ldi:

	* include/pkgconf/hal_sparclite_sim.h: Add define of
	CYGHWR_HAL_SPARCLITE_HAS_ASR17 for arch HAL to DTRT with SVT
	(anticipating cores with no SVT at all, so no %asr17)

1999-04-08  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/*.ldi: Revised SECTION_* macro arguments to
	avoid padded output sections (PR 19787)

1999-04-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_priv.c: Remove bogus FIX ME; it wasn't true.

1999-03-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/halboot.si: Add a dummy LED macro for debug in the
	vectors.S; correct a scary line length.

1999-03-04  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_sparclite_sim.h: Take out DEVICES dependencies.

1999-03-04  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/*.ldi: give all LDI files unique names so
        that they can co-exist in an eCos build tree (PR 19184)
	* include/pkgconf/*.mlt: give all MLT files unique names so
        that they can co-exist in an eCos build tree (PR 19184)

1999-02-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	These log entries from 1999-02-22 to 1999-02-24 were executed in
	a branch; this change is a merge of that branch into the trunk.

	(1999-02-23  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>)

	* include/pkgconf/hal_sparclite_sim.h: New rules
	CYGPKG_HAL_SPARCLITE_SIM precludes CYGPKG_DEVICES_GDB
	CYGPKG_HAL_SPARCLITE_SIM precludes CYGPKG_DEVICES_SERIAL_RS232_COMMON

	(1999-02-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>)

	* src/hal_priv.c (hal_board_prestart, hal_board_poststart): 
	Shut down the erc32 watchdog in and enable interrupts in these two
	new routines.

	* include/halboot.si: 
	Remove N/A code that I was just storing here, and install the real
	vector instructions in this fragment; there be cache-wangling to
	do in hardware cases either side of the vector installation.

1999-02-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_xpic.h: 
	Rename CYG_VECTOR_* -> CYGNUM_HAL_INTERRUPT_*

	* src/hal_priv.c:
	Add a FIX ME

1999-02-08  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sim.ld: Remove platform-specific linker script for
        MLT compliance.

	* src/PKGconf.mak: Remove build rules for sim.ld.

	* include/pkgconf/ram.*: Add MLT save file and and linker
        script fragment for RAM startup.

1999-02-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/halboot.si: 
	New file: performs platform-oriented setup of RAM and cache
	controllers, and quietens any interrupt sources.

	* include/pkgconf/hal_sparclite_sim.h: 
	Correct comments/CDL description of sim invocation.

1999-01-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_cache.h: NEW FILE to this directory; moved here from
	the sparclite/arch tree; cache control is very much board-specific

	* include/hal_clock.h: NEW FILE to this directory; it was a part
	of hal_intr.h, but is now here because the clock is target determined.

	* include/hal_xpic.h: NEW FILE to this directory; it was a part of
	hal_intr.h, but is now here because the detail of interrupot
	control is target determined.

	* src/hal_priv.c: NEW FILE to this directory; it was a part
	of hal_intr.h, but is now here because the clock is target
	determined, and it's the clock that needs a local variable.

	* src/PKGconf.mak (COMPILE): compile it.
	

1999-01-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sim.ld: 
	Add copyright notice.  (Though these files will later be generated
	by a tool and so not copyright, these default setups are.)

1999-01-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sim.ld: 
	Remove some bogus comments.

1999-01-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sim.ld: 
	Remove all traces of non-CYG_KERNEL_USE_INIT_PRIORITY code

1999-01-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sim.ld: 
	Align bss and rom/ram_data starts and ends by 8 bytes to permit
	fast copy routines.

1999-01-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	Modified files in arch:
	* include/hal_arch.h
	* include/hal_intr.h
	* src/PKGconf.mak
	* src/context.S
	* src/hal_intr.c
	* src/vec_ivsr.S
	* src/vec_xvsr.S
	* src/vectors.S

	New files in arch:
	* src/hal_boot.c	(bss initialization, constructors &c)
	* include/hal_cache.h	(empty but required header)

	Modified files in sim:
	* include/hal_diag.h

	Lots more progress; essentially, everything now works.

	Simulator's treatment of stdio is poor though, it doesn't work
	under pkgtest.  This has been slowing me up.

1999-01-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* ecc/ecc/hal/sparclite/...:

	Initial checkin of SPARClite HAL; it doesn't work yet, except the
	most trivial of tests - timer and interrupt manipulation stuff is
	entirely absent.

	Here's some documentation of the initial checkin tree; this will
	change, as platform dependent stuff moves correctly into the sim
	or <board> directories.

	arch/current/include:
		basetype.h	nothing much here.
		vectors.h	definitions of symbols shared between the
			various vector code assembler files, can be
			included in both C and assembler.
		hal_intr.h	various macros for clock and interrupt
			control plus the eCos vector numbering scheme; we
			map thus:
			what	SPARC trap type	    eCos vector numbers
			-----------------------------------------------
			(not used)   ---                0	
			interrupts (17-31)		1-15
			user traps (128-255)		16
			exceptions (1-9,36==4)		17-25
			others	   (10,?)		26
			-----------------------------------------------
			Trap types 5 and 6 which would be eCos vectors 21
			and 22 are handled in the trampoline code in
			file src/vectors.S
		hal_arch.h	definition of a thread context, plus
			macros for thread switching and the like.  Some
			ancillary bit twiddling macros and cache barriers
			too.

	arch/current/include/pkgconf:
		hal_sparclite.h 	pkgconf config/header file.
	
	arch/current/src:
		vectors.S	boot-up stuff, trampoline code that hangs
			on the interrupt/trap vector, handlers for window
			under/overflow.  Saves some state in registers
			then jumps to the interrupt or exception VSR
	   		respectively.
			Also instantiates the VSR table.
		vec_ivsr.S	the default interrupt VSR; it establishes
			a C calling environment (ie. anticipates a window
			overflow) then locks the scheduler, calls the ISR
			with appropriate arguments, and then interrupt_end()
			before undoing that environment, anticipating
			window underflow and returning to the interrupted
			instruction.
		vec_xvsr.S	the default exception AKA trap VSR; does
			the same as the interrupt one but without the
			scheduler lock or interrupt end.
		hal_intr.c	instantiates the ISR table used by the
			code above.
		context.S	context switch code, saves and loads up a
			whole register state, coroutine or longjump-like.
		icontext.c	initializes a context to "jump" to in
			context.S at the birth of a new thread.

	sim/current/include:
		hal_diag.h	macros to deal with debugging output via a
			fake serial device of some kind; initially empty,
			but definitely board/sim dependent.

	sim/current/include/pkgconf:
		hal_sparclite_sim.h 	pkgconf config/header file.

	sim/current/src:
		sim.ld		linker script bits for "sim" target.
