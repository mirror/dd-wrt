2004-10-04  Oyvind Harboe  <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

	* src/dlmalloc.cxx (resize_alloc): No longer invoke
	 cyg_memalloc_alloc_fail() on failure to resize. It is not an out
	 of memory condition, it just means the current memory allocation
	 could not be expanded. realloc() will try allocating a completely
	 new block of memory and only if that fails do we have an out of
	 memory condition.

2004-10-01  Oyvind Harboe  <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

	* heapgen.tcl: place the CYGBLD_ATTRIB_INIT_PRI such that it
	compiles for gcc 3.4.2 which is more picky about its placement.

2004-06-24  Oyvind Harboe  <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

	* Added cyg_memalloc_alloc_fail() fn which is invoked before 
	return NULL from failed allocations. Useful breakpoint site.
	Andrew Lunn wrote some of the code and pointed out various
	wrinkles to be ironed out.

2004-02-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/kapi.h: Add throw specifications throughout.
	* src/kapi.cxx: Ditto.

2003-10-06  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/dlmalloc.cxx (Cyg_Mempool_dlmalloc_Implementation): Fixed
	compiler warning added by previous patch.

2003-09-30  Eric Doenges <Eric.Doengea@DynaPel.com>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl, src/dlmalloc.cxx: Make the minimum memory
	alignment a configuration option for Doug Lea's memory allocator.

2002-04-24  Yoshinori Sato  <qzb04471@nifty.ne.jp>

	* src/memfixed.cxx (resize_alloc): Don't set default args in func
	definition.

2002-01-30  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx:
	Never call realloc() with a new size of 0, which frees the buffer.
	Fix the volatility of ptr.p

2002-01-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx (myrand): Fix overflow.

2002-01-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	as a limit.

	* include/sepmetaimpl.inl: CYGINT_ISO_STRING_MEMFUNCS checks

	check_alloced_memdq as inlines.

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Add new allocator supporting separate metadata,
	and the associated config options, and build sepmeta.cxx and tests.

	defined instead of default heap definition.
	* include/sepmeta.hxx, include/sepmetaimpl.hxx, include/sepmetaimpl.inl,
	src/sepmeta.cxx, tests/sepmeta1.cxx, tests/sepmeta2.cxx:
	New files for seperated metadata allocator.

2001-07-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/heapgen.tcl: Use constructor priority of CYG_INIT_MEMALLOC
	for heap objects in generated heaps.cxx.

2001-07-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/malloc1.c (main): Accoutn for allocators that do allocate

	* tests/malloc2.c (cyg_start): Ditto.
	* tests/malloc3.c (cyg_start): Ditto.
	* tests/malloc4.cxx (cyg_start): Ditto. Also add DEBUGTEST define
	and fix comment.

	* tests/testaux.hxx (STACKSIZE): Double.

2001-05-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/dlmalloc.cxx (Cyg_Mempool_dlmalloc_Implementation): Fix
	previous change; "top" is a pseudo variable via a NULL pointer if
	the heap is not initialized, so you can't use it as a flag for "no
	mem here"; and a typo, the comparison was reversed.  The two hid
	each other, so the check for "no mem here" usually said "OK".

2001-05-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/mvarimpl.inl (try_alloc): Allow zero sized heaps.
	(Cyg_Mempool_Variable_Implementation): Ditto.

	* tests/malloc4.cxx: Use semaphores to sync startup order.

2000-11-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/heapgen.tcl: Don't use cygpath -s for now as not all cygwins
	have it yet.

2000-11-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Make sure PWD variable doesn't clash with bash PWD
	by renaming to XPWD

2000-11-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Invoke heapgen.tcl with build directory
	surrounded by quotes (and do so in a portable way).

	to allow directories containing spaces. Also in a Solaris shell
	compatible way.

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl (CYGSEM_MEMALLOC_MALLOC_ZERO_RETURNS_NULL): 
	New option.
	* src/malloc.cxx (malloc): Use above option to decide if NULL should
	be returned on malloc(0).

2000-11-01  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/realloc.c (main): Use reasonable factor when making too
	large realloc (targets with 64MB would cause an overflow).

2000-10-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/testaux.hxx: Prototype cyg_hal_invoke_constructors()
	[ Forgot to check this in at the same time as below ]

	* tests/memvar1.cxx:
	* tests/memvar2.cxx:
	Make sure default priority constructors have been invoked.

2000-09-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/realloc.c (main): fix warning.
	* tests/malloc1.c (main): Same.
	* tests/malloc2.c (main): Same.
	* tests/malloc3.c (main): Same.

2000-08-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/heapgen.tcl: Fix tclsh invocation quoting problems

2000-07-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	heapgen.tcl's directory before running it

2000-07-26  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	var in each thread.

2000-07-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx (thrfree): Get mem size here. Tidy output.
	(thrmalloc): Get mem size in thrfree instead

	* src/heapgen.tcl: Refine search for user-defined name to cope with
	use of CYG_LABEL_DEFN macro

	Created as new package, merging existing memory allocator related stuff
	from the kernel and libc. Many bug fixes to existing stuff, as
	well as performance improvements, and extra features such as
	a port of dlmalloc, and the ability to support multiple disjoint
	heaps, possibly with run-time configurable size.
	There's even a bit of documentation, and some new tests
