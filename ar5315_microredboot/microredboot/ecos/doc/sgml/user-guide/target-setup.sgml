<TITLE>Use with GDB Stub ROM</TITLE>
<PARA>The eCos Developer&rsquo;s Kit package comes with a ROM
image which provides GDB support for
the Matsushita(R) AM33 STB System Reference Board. To install the
GDB stub ROM requires the use of the JTAG debugger and the Flash ROM
programming code available from Matsushita. An image of this ROM
is also provided at <filename>loaders/am33-stb/gdbload.bin</filename> under
the root of your eCos installation.</PARA>
<PARA>Ensure that there is a Flash ROM card in MAIN MEMORY SLOT &lt;0&#62;.
Follow the directions for programming a Flash ROM supplied with
the programming software.</PARA>
<PARA>The final programming of the ROM will need to be done with
a command similar to the following:</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>fdown "gdbload.bin",0x80000000,16,1</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>Once the ROM has been programmed, close down the JTAG debugger,
turn the STB off, and disconnect the JTAG cable. Ensure that the
hardware switches are in the following configuration:</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>U U D D D U D D

D = lower part of rocker switch pushed in
U = upper part of rocker switch pushed in</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>This is also the configuration required by the Flash programming
code, so it should not be necessary to change these.</PARA>
<PARA>Restart the STB and the stub ROM will now be able to communicate
with <PRODUCTNAME>GDB</PRODUCTNAME>. eCos programs should be built
with RAM startup.</PARA>
<PARA>Programs can then be downloaded via a standard RS232 null
modem serial cable connected to the SERIAL1 connector on the STB
front panel (the AM33&quot;s serial port 0). This line is programmed
to run at 38400 baud, 8 data bits, no parity and 1 stop bit (8-N-1)
with no flow control. A gender changer may also be required. Diagnostic
output will be output to GDB using the same connection.</PARA>

this to work there must be an SDRAM memory card in SUB MEMORY SLOT &lt;0&#62; and
the hardware switches on the front panel set to the following: </PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>D U D D D U D D

D = lower part of rocker switch pushed in
U = upper part of rocker switch pushed in</PROGRAMLISTING>

<PARA>eCos comes with two Flash ROM images that provide GDB support
for the Cirrus Logic EP7211 Development Board (also known as the
EDB7211).. Note that on some board revisions, the board is silk-screened
as EDB7111-2. The first Flash ROM image provides a port of the CygMon
ROM monitor, which includes a command-line interface and a GDB remote
stub. The second Flash ROM image provides a remote GDB stub only.</PARA>
<PARA>Both ROM images are provided in the directory loaders/arm-edb7211
under the root of your eCos installation. CygMon images are prefixed
with the name 'edb7211_cygmon' and are
provided in a number of formats including binary (.bin extension)
and SREC (.srec) extension. GDB stub ROM images are given the prefix 'edb7211_gdb_module'. </PARA>
<PARA>The ROM images provided for the EP7211 Development Board must
be programmed into the FLASH. Please refer to the section titled
"Loading the ROM image into On-Board flash" on how to program the
ROM onto the board.</PARA>
<PARA>Both Cygmon and GDB Stub ROMS allow communication with GDB
via the serial connector labelled 'UART 1'. The
communication parameters are fixed at 38400 baud, 8 data bits, no
parity bit and 1 stop bit (8-N-1). No flow control is employed.
Connection to the host computer should be made using a null modem cable.
A gender changer may also be required. Note that the GDB Configuration tool
uses the serial port identifiers 0 and 1 to identify the EB7211
serial ports UART1 and UART2 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA>Both eCos and the ROM images assume the core clock is generated
with a 3.6864 MHz PLL input. The CPU will be configured to run at
73.728MHz.</PARA>
<PARA>Note: The EP7211 CPU needs a two step RESET process. After

<PARA>To setup the EP7212 Development Board for use with the

connect TEST0 and TEST1 of the EP7212 to ground.  On the Development
Board, this is accomplished by placing shorting blocks on JP47 and
JP48. When the shorting blocks are fitted, the board can only be
operated through the Multi-ICE - debugging over a serial line is
not possible.</PARA>

<TITLE>90MHz Operation</TITLE>
<PARA>
The EP7xxx targets offer a choice of clock speeds, from 18MHz to a maximum,
normally, of 72MHz.  These are described as kHz values 18432 36864 49152
and 73728 within the configuration tool.  If you have a release which
supports it, you will also see 90317 as an available option here, for 90MHz
operation.
</PARA>
<PARA>
This option only applies to certain EP7312 hardware, not all EP7312 boards
support it.  Do not select 90MHz when building RedBoot or your eCos
application unless you are absolutely sure that your board supports it.
</PARA>
<PARA>
If you do have a 90MHz board and wish to execute at 90MHz, it is in fact
not necessary to build RedBoot specially, if you build your eCos
application configured for 90MHz.  RedBoot will run at 72MHz and your
application will run at 90MHz.  If you do install a 90MHz RedBoot, then you
must build eCos for 90MHz or timing and baud rates on serial I/O will be
wrong.
</PARA>
<PARA>
In other words, code (either eCos app or RedBoot) built for 90MHz will
&ldquo;change up a gear&rdquo; when it starts up; but code built for 72MHz,
because it needs to run correctly on boards without the
&ldquo;gearbox&rdquo; does not change back down, so if you mix the two,
unexpected timing can result.  To run a non-eCos application without any
hardware initialization code at 90MHz, you must install a specially-built
RedBoot.

<TITLE>Loading the ROM Image into On-board Flash</TITLE>
<PARA>There are several ways to install the eCos gdb stub ROM image
in the EBSA board&rsquo;s flash memory. Once installed, the gdb
stub ROM provides standard eCos download and debug via the EBSA
board&quot;s serial port. The options available include the
Linux based EBSA flash upgrade utility provided by Red Hat, direct writing
of the flash via MultiICE (JTAG) hardware debugger, and other flash management
utilities from Intel (these only support DOS, and proprietary ARM tools
and image formats). Only the Red Hat flash upgrade tool is supported
and tested in this release.</PARA>
<PARA>The flash upgrade tool requires the EBSA board to be configured
as a PCI slave (rather than a master, its normal operating mode)
and plugged into a Linux host computer&quot;s PCI bus.</PARA>
<PARA>Configuring the board for flash loading: Follow the instructions
in the EBSA-285 Reference Manual, pages A-2 and A-3 to configure
the board as an add-in card, and enable flash blank programming.
 Briefly: assuming the board was in the default setting to execute
as a bus master ("Host Bridge") make jumper 9 (J9), move jumper
10 (J10) to external reset (PCI_RST), and move jumper 15
(J15) link 4-6-5 to connect 5-6 instead of 4-6.</PARA>
<PARA>Configuring the board for execution of eCos programs: Follow
the instructions in the EBSA-285 Reference Manual, pages A-2 and
A-3 to configure the board as a "Host Bridge" with "Central Function".
 Briefly: unset J9, move J10 to on-board reset (BRD_RST),
and set J15 to make 4-6 instead of 5-6 (see page A-8 also).  Plug
the card into its own PCI bus, not the Linux PC used for the flash-programming
process.</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>      % mknod /dev/safl c 10 178</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>Programming the flash: switch off the EBSA-285, and remove
the EBSA-285 board from its PCI bus.  Take appropriate anti-static
precautions. Configure it for flash loading as above, halt your
Linux system and turn it off.  Install the EBSA-285 board in the
PCI bus of the Linux system and boot it up. (Single user is good enough,
assuming your image and safl_util build dir are on a local
disc partition.)  Change directory to the safl_util directory,
then, to load the kernel module and flash an image onto the eval

<PARA>This information is replicated in the README file within the
safl_util directory and its parents, and in the EBSA-285
Reference Manual from Intel, appendix A "Configuration Guide".

<PARA>This procedure also applies for loading ROM-startup eCos programs
into the on-board flash memory, given a binary format image of the

software.  These commands may be issued directly in the MDI window
or they may be issued from the gdb client through the "monitor"
command.</PARA>
<PARA>On the Cosmo CEB-V850 board, on-chip Flash is mapped at address
0x0, the on-board EPROM at 0x100000 and the on-board RAM at 0xfc0000.
Since a stand alone V850 will start executing from address 0x0 on
reset, it is normal to load either an application or a bootstrap
loader for Flash at this address. eCos programs may be built to
boot from Flash or the on-board EPROM. If building for the on-board
EPROM, it would be expected that the Flash will contain the default
CEB-V850 flash contents. An ELF format version of the default contents
may be found in the eCos distribution with the name v850flash.img.</PARA>
<PARA>In stand alone operation, normally the code in this flash image
would have been programmed into the V850 on the Cosmo board, and
this would cause it to vector into the on-board EPROM to run the
application located there. In the case of eCos, this application
may be a GDB stub ROM application, allowing the further download
to RAM over serial of actual applications to debug.</PARA>
<PARA>As an example, we shall demonstrate how to use the I.C.E.
to download the v850flash.img and GDB stub EPROM image using I.C.E.
emulator memory only, and not requiring any actual programming of
devices.</PARA>

<PARA>NOTE: The four "monitor step" commands are only required the
first time the board is connected to the I.C.E., otherwise the program
will fail.</PARA>
<PARA>This is because of a limitation of the I.C.E. hardware that
means that the first time it is used, the "map" commands are not
acted on and the addresses "0x100000" and "0xfc0000" are not mapped.
This can be observed using the command "td e-20" in the MDI application&quot;s
console to display the trace buffer, which will show that the contents
of address 0x100000 are not valid. Subsequent runs do not require
the "monitor step" commands.</PARA>
<PARA>It is unusual to load two executable images to a target through
gdb.  From the example above notice that this is accomplished by
attaching to the libremote server, loading the flash image, detaching,
reattaching, and loading the ROM/RAM image. It is more
normal to build an executable image that can be executed directly.
In eCos this is achieved by selecting either the ROM or ROMRAM startup
type, and optionally enable building for the internal FLASH. The
I.C.E. emulator memory can emulate both the internal FLASH and the
EPROM, so real hardware programming is not required.</PARA>
<PARA>Upon running this example you will notice that the libremote
server does not exit upon detecting a detach request, but simply
begins listening for the next attach request.  To cause v850ice
to terminate, issue the "monitor quit" or "monitor exit" command
from the gdb client.  v850ice will then terminate with the next
detach request.  (You can also enter control-c in the Cygwin/DOS
window where v850ice is running.)</PARA>

<PARA>If a filename is referenced in an MDI command, whether the

libremote server system.  When specifying a filename when entering
a command in the MDI window it is obvious that a server local file
is being referenced.  When issuing an MDI command from the gdb client, the
user must remember that the command line is simply passed to the
I.C.E. software on the server system.  The command is executed by
the I.C.E. software as though it were entered locally.</PARA>
<PARA>Executable images may be loaded into the V850 target by entering
the "load" command in the MDI window or with the gdb "load" command.
 If the MDI load command is used, the executable image must be located
on the server system and must be in S Record format.  If the gdb
load command is used, the executable image must be located on the
client system and must be in ELF format.</PARA>
<PARA>Be aware that the gdb client is not aware of debugger commands
issued from the MDI window.  It is possible to cause the gdb client
and the I.C.E. software to get out of sync by issuing commands from
both interfaces during the same debugging session.</PARA>

"RAM" startup type, as they are expected to operate underneath a

<PARA>at the GDB console prompt, where ADDRESS is the address of
the syscall information structure included in the applications.
In eCos this has been designed to be located at a consistent address
for each CPU model (V850/SA1 or V850/SB1). It
may be determined from an eCos executable using the following command
at a cygwin bash prompt:</PARA>
<PARA><PROGRAMLISTING>v850-elf-nm EXECUTABLE | grep hal_v85x_ice_syscall_info</PROGRAMLISTING></PARA>
<PARA>At the current time, this address is 0xfc0400 for a Cosmo
board fitted with a V850/SA1, or 0xfc0540 for a Cosmo board
fitted with a V850/SB1.</PARA>
<PARA>So for example, the GDB command for the SB1 would be:</PARA>
<PARA><PROGRAMLISTING>(gdb) monitor syscallinfo 0xfc0540</PROGRAMLISTING></PARA>
<PARA>Given that the syscallinfo address is fixed over all eCos
executables for a given target, it is possible to define it on the
libremote command line as well using the "-t" option, for example:</PARA>
<PARA><PROGRAMLISTING>bash$ v850ice -t 0xfc0400
v850ice: listening on port 2345</PROGRAMLISTING></PARA>

The only significant differences are that pre-built loaders are available

eCos application on the PC can be run in three ways: via RedBoot,

</para>
<sect2>
<title>RedBoot Support</title>
<PARA>For information about setting up the PC to run with RedBoot,
consult the RedBoot User&quot;s Guide. If using serial debugging,
the serial line runs at 38400 baud 8-N-1 and should be connected
to the debug host using a null modem cable. If ethernet debugging
is required, an i82559 compatible network interface card, such as
an Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100,  should be installed
on the target PC and connected to the development PC running GDB.
When RedBoot is configured appropriately to have an IP address set,
then GDB will be able to debug directly over TCP/IP to the
target PC.</PARA>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Floppy Disk Support</title>
<para>
If an application is built with a startup type of FLOPPY, then it is
configured to be a self-booting image that must be written onto a
formatted floppy disk. This will erase any existing file system or
data that is already on the disk, so proceed
with caution.
</para>
<para>
To write an application to floppy disk, it must first be converted to
a pure binary format. This is done with the following command:
</para>
<screen width=72>
$ <userinput>i386-elf-objcopy -O binary app.elf app.bin</userinput>
</screen>
<para>
Here <filename>app.elf</filename> is the final linked application
executable, in ELF format (it may not have a <filename>.elf</filename>
extension). The file <filename>app.bin</filename> is the resulting
pure binary file. This must be written to the floppy disk with the
following command:
<screen width=72>
$ <userinput>dd conv=sync if=app.bin of=/dev/fd0</userinput>
</screen>
</para>
<para>For NT Cygwin users, this can be done by first ensuring that the raw
floppy device is mounted as <filename>/dev/fd0</filename>. To check if this
is the case, type the command <command>mount</command> at the Cygwin bash
prompt. If the floppy drive is already mounted, it will be listed as something
similar to the following line:</para>
<screen>  \\.\a: /dev/fd0 user binmode</screen>
<para>If this line is not listed, then mount the floppy drive using the command:
</para>
<screen>$ <userinput>mount -f -b //./a: /dev/fd0</userinput></screen>
<para>To actually install the boot image on the floppy, use the command:</para>
<screen>
$ <userinput>dd conv=sync if=app.bin of=/dev/fd0</userinput>
</screen>
<para>Insert this floppy in the A: drive of the PC to be used as a target
and ensure that the BIOS is configured to boot from A: by default. On reset,
the PC will boot from the floppy and the eCos application will load
itself and execute immediately.</para>
<note><title>NOTE</title>
<para>Unreliable floppy media may cause the write to silently fail. This
can be determined if the RedBoot image does not correctly
boot. In such cases, the floppy should be (unconditionally) reformatted
using the <command>fdformat</command> command on Linux, or
<command>format a: /u</command> on DOS/Windows. If this fails, try a
different disk.</para>
</note>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>GRUB Bootloader Support</title>
<para>
If an application is built with the GRUB startup type, it is
configured to be loaded by the GRUB bootloader.
</para>
<para>
GRUB is an open source boot loader that supports many different
operating systems. It is available from
<ulink
url="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub">http://www.gnu.org/software/grub</ulink>.
The latest version of GRUB should be downloaded from there and installed.
In Red Hat Linux version 7.2 and later it is the default bootloader
for Linux and therefore is already installed.
</para>
<para>
To install GRUB on a floppy disk from Linux you need to execute the
following commands:
</para>
<screen>
$ <userinput>mformat a:</userinput>
$ <userinput>mount /mnt/floppy</userinput>
$ <userinput>grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/floppy '(fd0)'</userinput>
Probing devices to guess BIOS drives. This may take a long time.
Installation finished. No error reported.
This is the contents of the device map /mnt/floppy/boot/grub/device.map.
Check if this is correct or not. If any of the lines is incorrect,
fix it and re-run the script `grub-install'.

(fd0)	/dev/fd0
$ <userinput>cp $ECOS_REPOSITORY/packages/hal/i386/pc/current/misc/menu.lst /mnt/floppy/boot/grub</userinput>
$ <userinput>umount /mnt/floppy</userinput>
</screen>
<para>
The file <filename>menu.lst</filename> is an example GRUB menu
configuration file. It contains menu items to load some of the
standard eCos tests from floppy or from partition zero of the first
hard disk. You should, of course, customize this file to load your own
application. Alternatively you can use the command-line interface of
GRUB to input commands yourself.
</para>
<para>
Applications can be installed, or updated simply by copying them to
the floppy disk at the location expected by the
<filename>menu.lst</filename> file. For booting from floppy disks it
is recommended that the executable be stripped of all debug and symbol
table information before copying. This reduces the size of the file
and can make booting faster.
</para>
<para>
To install GRUB on a hard disk, refer to the GRUB documentation. Be
warned, however, that if you get this wrong it may compromise any
existing bootloader that exists on the hard disk and may make any
other operating systems unbootable. Practice on floppy disks or
sacrificial hard disks first. On machines running Red Hat Linux
version 7.2 and later, you can just add your own menu items to the
<filename>/boot/grub/menu.lst</filename> file that already exists.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Debugging FLOPPY and GRUB Applications</title>
<para>
When RedBoot loads an application it also provides debugging services
in the form of GDB remote protocol stubs. When an application is
loaded stand-alone from a floppy disk, or by GRUB, these services are
not present. To allow these application to be debugged, it is possible
to include GDB stubs into the application.
</para>
<para>
To do this, set the &quot;Support for GDB stubs&quot;
(<literal>CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INCLUDE_STUBS</literal>) configuration
option. Following this any application built will allow GDB to connect
to the debug serial port (by default serial device 0, also known as
COM1) whenever the application takes an exception, or if a Control-C
is typed to the debug port. Ethernet debugging is not supported.
</para>
<para>
The option &quot;Enable initial breakpoint&quot;
(<literal>CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INITIAL_BREAK</literal>) causes the HAL
to take a breakpoint immediately before calling cyg_start(). This
gives the developer a chance to set any breakpoints or inspect the
system state before it proceeds. The configuration sets this option by
default if GDB stubs are included, and this is not a RedBoot build. To
make the application execute immediately either disable this option,
or disable <literal>CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INCLUDE_STUBS</literal>.

<TITLE><!-- <conditionaltext> --><!-- <index></index> -->i386/Linux Synthetic Target Setup</TITLE>
<PARA>When building for the synthetic Linux target, the resulting
binaries are native Linux applications with the HAL providing suitable
bindings between the eCos kernel and the Linux kernel.</PARA>
<NOTE>
<PARA>Please be aware that the current implementation of the Linux
synthetic target does not allow thread-aware debugging.</PARA>
</NOTE>
<PARA>These Linux applications cannot be run on a Windows system.
However, it is possible to write a similar HAL emulation for the
Windows kernel if such a testing target is desired.</PARA>
<SECT2>
<TITLE>Tools</TITLE>

<PARA>For the synthetic target, eCos relies on features not available
in native compilers earlier than gcc-2.95.1. It also requires version
2.9.5 or later of the GNU linker. If you have gcc-2.95.1 or later
and ld version 2.9.5 or later, then you do not need to build new
tools. eCos does not support earlier versions. You can check the compiler
version using <COMMAND>gcc -v</COMMAND> 
and the linker version using <COMMAND>ld
-v</COMMAND>.</PARA>

<PARA>If you have native tools that are sufficiently recent for
use with eCos, you should be aware that by default eCos assumes
that the tools <COMMAND>i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc</COMMAND>, <COMMAND>i686-pc-linux-gnu-ar</COMMAND>,
 <COMMAND>i686-pc-linux-gnu-ld</COMMAND>, and <COMMAND>i686-pc-linux-gnu-objcopy</COMMAND> are
on your system and are the correct versions for use with eCos. But
instead, you can tell eCos to use your native tools by editing the
configuration value "Global command prefix" (CYGBLD_GLOBAL_COMMAND_PREFIX)
in your eCos configuration. If left empty (i.e. set to the empty
string) eCos will use your native tools when building.</PARA>
<PARA>If you have any difficulties, it is almost certainly easiest
overall to rebuild the tools as described on: <ULINK URL="http://ecos.sourceware.org/getstart.html">http://ecos.sourceware.org/getstart.html</ULINK></PARA>
