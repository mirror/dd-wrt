config NTFSPLUS_FS
	tristate "NTFS+ file system support"
	select NLS
	help
	  NTFS is the file system of Microsoft Windows NT, 2000, XP and 2003.
	  This allows you to mount devices formatted with the ntfs file system.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called
	  ntfsplus.

config NTFSPLUS_DEBUG
	bool "NTFS+ debugging support"
	depends on NTFSPLUS_FS
	help
	  If you are experiencing any problems with the NTFS file system, say
	  Y here.  This will result in additional consistency checks to be
	  performed by the driver as well as additional debugging messages to
	  be written to the system log.  Note that debugging messages are
	  disabled by default.  To enable them, supply the option debug_msgs=1
	  at the kernel command line when booting the kernel or as an option
	  to insmod when loading the ntfs module.  Once the driver is active,
	  you can enable debugging messages by doing (as root):
	  echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/ntfs-debug
	  Replacing the "1" with "0" would disable debug messages.

	  If you leave debugging messages disabled, this results in little
	  overhead, but enabling debug messages results in very significant
	  slowdown of the system.

	  When reporting bugs, please try to have available a full dump of
	  debugging messages while the misbehaviour was occurring.

config NTFSPLUS_FS_POSIX_ACL
	bool "NTFS+ POSIX Access Control Lists"
	depends on NTFSPLUS_FS
	select FS_POSIX_ACL
	help
	  POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) support additional access rights
	  for users and groups beyond the standard owner/group/world scheme,
	  and this option selects support for ACLs specifically for ntfs
	  filesystems.
	  NOTE: this is linux only feature. Windows will ignore these ACLs.

	  If you don't know what Access Control Lists are, say N.
