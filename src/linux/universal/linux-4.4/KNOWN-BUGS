KNOWN BUGS
==========

After end of 4.4-stable maintainance, CIP project maintains 4.4 kernel
tree. We try to fix as man bugs as possible, but sometimes backport
from mainline is not feasible or not done by the stable team, and
sometimes backport from 4.9-stable to 4.4-st is not feasible or not
done for other reasons.

In major cases this happens, we'll try to add notes here. Detailed
per-patch status is available at
git@gitlab.com:cip-project/cip-kernel/lts-commit-list.git file
v4.4.org, or can be pulled from git history.

Not all speculation fixes from 4.9.306, 4.9.310 and 4.9.319 were
merged here. These affect mostly x86 and arm64 architectures.

Random rewrite from 4.9.320 was not backported. We have seen no good
explanation why it is needed, and it is rather intrusive.

These commits were not backported and may need more investigation:
