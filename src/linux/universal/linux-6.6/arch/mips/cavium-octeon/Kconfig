	  The CN63XXP1 chip requires build time workarounds to
	  function reliably, select this option to enable them.  These
	  workarounds will cause a slight decrease in performance on
	  non-CN63XXP1 hardware, so it is recommended to select "n"
	  unless it is known the workarounds are needed.

	range 0 50
	default 0
	help
	  CVMSEG LM is a segment that accesses portions of the dcache
	  as a local memory; the larger CVMSEG is, the smaller the
	  cache is.  The kernel uses two or three blocks (one for TLB
	  exception handlers, one for driver IOBDMA operations, and on
	  models that need it, one for LMTDMA operations). This
	  selects an optional extra number of CVMSEG lines for use by
	  other software.

	  Normally no extra lines are required, and this parameter
	  should be set to zero.

	help
	  Reserve a shared memory region for user processes to use for hardware
	  memory buffers. This is required for 32bit applications to be able to
	  send and receive packets directly. Applications access this memory by
	  memory mapping /dev/mem for the addresses in /proc/octeon_info. For
	  optimal performance with HugeTLBs, keep this size an even number of
	  megabytes.

	  initialize, and fill fpa pools.
