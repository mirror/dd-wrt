Release:	mini_fo-0.6.1 (v0-6-1)
Date:		21.09.2005


Changes:
--------
v0-6-1:

- bugfixes (see ChangeLog)

- two helper scripts "mini_fo_merge" and "mini_fo_overlay" (see
  README for details).

v0-6-0:

- Support for 2.4 and 2.6 (see Makefile)

- Partial hard link support (creating works as expected, but already
  existing links in the base file system will be treated as if they
  were individual files).

- Various bugfixes and cleanups.


v0-6-0-pre1:

- This is mini_fo-0-6-0-pre1! This release is a complete rewrite of
  many vital mini_fo parts such as the old whiteout list code which
  has been replaced by the new META subsystem.

- Light weight directory renaming implemented. This means if a
  directory is renamed via the mini_fo filesystem this will no longer
  result in a complete copy in storage, instead only one empty
  directory will be created. All base filed contained in the original
  directory stay there until modified.

- Special files (creating, renaming, deleting etc.) now working.

- Many bugfixes and cleanup, mini_fo is now a lot more stable.


v0-5-10:

- Final release of the 0-5-* versions. Next will be a complete rewrite
  of many features. This release contains several bugfixes related to
  directory renaming.


v0-5-10-pre6:

- Lots of cleanup and several bugfixes related to directory deleting

- Directory renaming suddenly works, what is most likely due to the
  fact tha that "mv" is smart: if the classic rename doesn't work it
  will assume that source and target file are on different fs and will
  copy the directory and try to remove the source directory. Until
  directory removing wasn't implemented, it would fail to do this and
  rollback.
  So, directory renaming works for now, but it doesn't yet do what you
  would expect from a overlay fs, so use with care.


v0-5-10-pre5:

- implemented directory deleting
- made parsing of mount options more stable
- New format of mount options! (See README)
- I can't reproduce the unknown panic with 2.4.25 anymore, so I'll
  happily assume it never existed!


Implemented features:
---------------------

- creating hard links (see BUGS on already existing hard links)
- lightweight directory renaming
- renaming device files, pipes, sockets, etc.
- creating, renaming, deleting of special files
- deleting directorys
- general directory reading (simple "ls" )
- creating files in existing directorys
- creating directorys
- renaming files.
- reading and writing files (involves opening)
- appending to files (creates copy in storage)
- deleting files
- llseek works too, what allows editors to work
- persistency (a deleted file stay deleted over remounts)
- use of symbolic links
- creating of device files


Not (yet) implemented features:
-------------------------------

- full hard link support.



BUGS:
-----

Hard links in the base file system will be treated as individual
files, not as links to one inode.

The main problem with hard links isn't allowing to create them, but
their pure existence. If you modify a base hard link, the changes made
will only show up on this link, the other link will remain in the
original state. I hope to fix this someday. Please note that this does
not effect the special hard links '.' and '..', that are handled
seperately by the lower fs.
