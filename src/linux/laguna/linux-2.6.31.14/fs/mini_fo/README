README for the mini_fo overlay file system
=========================================


WHAT IS MINI_FO?
----------------

mini_fo is a virtual kernel file system that can make read-only
file systems writable. This is done by redirecting modifying operations
to a writeable location called "storage directory", and leaving the
original data in the "base directory" untouched. When reading, the
file system merges the modifed and original data so that only the
newest versions will appear. This occurs transparently to the user,
who can access the data like on any other read-write file system.

Base and storage directories may be located on the same or on
different partitions and may be of different file system types. While
the storage directory obviously needs to be writable, the base may or
may not be writable, what doesn't matter as it will no be modified
anyway.


WHAT IS GOOD FOR?
-----------------

The primary purpose of the mini_fo file system is to allow easy
software updates to embedded systems, that often store their root
file system in a read-only flash file system, but there are many
more as for example sandboxing, or for allowing live-cds to
permanently store information.


BUILDING
--------
This should be simple. Adjust the Makefile to point to the correct
kernel headers you want to build the module for. Then:

    # make

should build "mini_fo.o" for a 2.4 kernel or "mini_fo.ko" for a 2.6
kernel.

If you are building the module for you current kernel, you can install
the module (as root):

    # make install

or uninstall with

    # make uninstall


USING THE FILE SYSTEM
--------------------

the general mount syntax is:

   mount -t mini_fo -o base=<base directory>,sto=<storage directory>\
                            <base directory> <mount point>

Example:

You have mounted a cdrom to /mnt/cdrom and want to modifiy some files
on it:

load the module (as root)

    # insmod mini_fo.o for a 2.4 kernel or

    # insmod mini_fo.ko for a 2.6 kernel


create a storage dir in tmp and a mountpoint for mini_fo:

    # mkdir /tmp/sto
    # mkdir /mnt/mini_fo

and mount the mini_fo file system:

    # mount -t mini_fo -o base=/mnt/cdrom,sto=/tmp/sto /mnt/cdrom /mnt/mini_fo


Now the data stored on the cd can be accessed via the mini_fo
mountpoint just like any read-write file system, files can be modified
and deleted, new ones can be created and so on. When done unmount the
file system:

    # unmount /mnt/mini_fo

Note that if the file system is mounted again using the same storage
file system, of course it will appear in the modified state again. If
you remount it using an new empty storage directory, it will be
unmodified. Therefore by executing:

    # cd /tmp/sto
    # rm -rf *

you can nuke all the changes you made to the original file system. But
 remember NEVER do this while the mini_fo file system is mounted!


Alternatively you can use the mini_fo-overlay bash script, that
simplifies managing mini_fo mounts. See TOOLS Section.


TOOLS
-----

mini_fo-merge (experimental):

This is a bash script that will merge changes contained in the storage
directory back to the base directory. This allows mini_fo to function
as a cache file system by overlaying a slow (network, ...) file system
and using a fast (ramdisk, ...) as storage. When done, changes can be
merged back to the (slow) base with mini_fo-merge. See "mini_fo-merge
-h" for details.

It can be usefull for merging changes back after a successfull test
(patches, software updates...)


mini_fo-overlay:

This bash script simplifies managing one or more mini_fo mounts. For
overlaying a directory called "basedir1", you can just call:

    # mini_fo-overlay basedir1

This will mount mini_fo with "basedir1" as base, "/tmp/sto-basedir1/"
as storage to "/mnt/mini_fo-basedir1/". It has more options though,
type "mini_fo-overlay -h" for details.


DOCUMENTATION, REPORTING BUGS, GETTING HELP

WARNINGS
--------

Never modify the base or the storage directorys while the mini_fo
file system is mounted, or you might crash you system. Simply accessing
and reading should not cause any trouble.

Exporting a mini_fo mount point via NFS has not been tested, and may
or may not work.

Check the RELEASE_NOTES for details on bugs and features.
