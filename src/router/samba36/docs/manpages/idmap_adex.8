.SH "NAME"
idmap_adex \- Samba\'s idmap_adex Backend for Winbind
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The idmap_adex plugin provides a way for Winbind to read id mappings from an AD server that uses RFC2307 schema extensions\&. This module implements both the idmap and nss_info APIs and supports domain trustes as well as two\-way cross forest trusts\&. It is a read\-only plugin requiring that the administrator provide mappings in advance by adding the POSIX attribute information to the users and groups objects in AD\&. The most common means of doing this is using "Identity Services for Unix" support on Windows 2003 R2 and later\&.
.PP
Note that you must add the uidNumber, gidNumber, and uid attributes to the partial attribute set of the forest global catalog servers\&. This can be done using the Active Directory Schema Management MMC plugin (schmmgmt\&.dll)\&.
.SH "NSS_INFO"
.PP
The nss_info plugin supports reading the unixHomeDirectory, gidNumber, loginShell, and uidNumber attributes from the user object and the gidNumber attribute from the group object to fill in information required by the libc getpwnam() and getgrnam() family of functions\&. Group membership is filled in according to the Windows group membership and not the msSFU30PosixMember attribute\&.
.PP
Username aliases are implement by setting the uid attribute on the user object\&. While group name aliases are implemented by reading the displayname attribute from the group object\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The following example shows how to retrieve idmappings and NSS data from our principal and trusted AD domains\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
	[global]
	idmap config * : backend = adex
	idmap config * : range = 1000\-4000000000

	winbind nss info = adex
	winbind normalize names = yes
	
.fi
.if n \{\

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
