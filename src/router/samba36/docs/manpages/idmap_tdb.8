.SH "NAME"
idmap_tdb \- Samba\'s idmap_tdb Backend for Winbind
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The idmap_tdb plugin is the default backend used by winbindd for storing SID/uid/gid mapping tables\&.
.PP
In contrast to read only backends like idmap_rid, it is an allocating backend: This means that it needs to allocate new user and group IDs in order to create new mappings\&.
.SH "IDMAP OPTIONS"

range = low \- high
.RS 4
Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the backend is authoritative\&.

	# "backend = tdb" is redundant here since it is the default
	idmap config * : backend = tdb
	idmap config * : range = 1000000\-2000000
