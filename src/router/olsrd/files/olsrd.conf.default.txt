###########################
### Basic configuration ###
###########################
# keep this settings at the beginning of your first configuration file

# Debug level (0-9)
# If set to 0 the daemon runs in the background, unless "NoFork" is set to true
# (default is 1)

# DebugLevel  1

# IP version to use (4 or 6)
# (default is 4)

# IpVersion 4

#################################
### OLSRd agent configuration ###
#################################
# this parameters control the settings of the routing agent which are not
# related to the OLSR protocol and it's extensions

# Clear the screen each time the internal state changes
# (default is yes)

# ClearScreen     yes

# Should olsrd keep on running even if there are
# no interfaces available? This is a good idea
# for a PCMCIA/USB hotswap environment.
# (default is yes)

# AllowNoInt  yes

# LockFile
# The lockfile is used to prevent multiple OLSR instances running at the same
# time.
# (Linux/BSD default is "/var/run/olsrd-ipv(4/6).lock")
# (Win32     default is "[configfile]-ipv(4/6).lock")

# LockFile "/var/run/olsrd-ipv4.lock"

# Polling rate for OLSR sockets in seconds (float).
# (default is 0.05)

# Pollrate  0.05

# Interval to poll network interfaces for configuration changes (in seconds).
# Linux systems can detect interface statechange via netlink sockets.
# (default is 2.5)

# NicChgsPollInt  2.5

# TOS(type of service) value for the IP header of control traffic.
# (default is 192)

# TosValue 192

# FIBMetric controls the metric value of the host-routes OLSRd sets.
# - "flat" means that the metric value is always 2 (or as configured
#   with FIBMetricDefault). This is the preferred value because it helps
#   the linux kernel routing to clean up older routes
# - "correct" use the hopcount as the metric value.
# - "approx" use the hopcount as the metric value too, but does only update the
#   hopcount if the nexthop changes too
# (default is "flat")

# FIBMetric "flat"

# Default FIB metric.
# The kernel FIB does not need to know the metric of a route.
# This saves us from enqueuing/dequeueing hopcount only changes.
# (default is 2)

# FIBMetricDefault 2

### Linux specific OLSRd extensions ###
#######################################
# these parameters are only working on linux at the moment, but might become
# useful on BSD in the future

# of the node. In addition to this an additional localhost device is created
# to make sure the returning traffic can be received.

# Specifies the routing Table olsr uses
# RtTable is for host routes, RtTableDefault for the route to the default
# internet gateway (2 in case of IPv6+NIIT) and RtTableTunnel is for
# routes to the ipip tunnels, valid values are 1 to 254
# There is a special parameter "auto" (choose default below)

# SmartGatewayUseCount 1

# Determines the take-down percentage for a non-current smart gateway tunnel.
# If the cost of the current smart gateway tunnel is less than this percentage

# This setting is only relevant when SmartGatewayUseCount is larger than 1;
# a value of 0 will result in the tunnels not being taken down proactively.
# (default is 25)

# SmartGatewayTakeDownPercentage 25

# Determines the olsrd instance id, which is needed for proper cleanup
# of multi-gateway iptables and ip rules when running multiple olsrd

# instances running on the node. It may not contain whitespace and may
# not be empty.
# (default is <not set>)

# (default is 90)

# SmartGatewayTablesOffset 90

# Determines the policy routing rules offset for multi-gateway policy routing
# rules. See the policy routing script for an explanation.
# (default is 0, which indicates that the rules and tables should be aligned and

# of the gateway costs applies.
# (default is 2560)

# SmartGatewayMaxCostMaxEtx 2560

# Defines what kind of Uplink this node will publish as a
