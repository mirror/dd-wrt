Building olsrd for Android
--------------------------

In order to build olsrd and the plugins for Android, you will need to
download the free (as in beer, and mostly as in speech) Android NDK.  NDK r10
or later is the best to have.

http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html

Once you have that installed, run this in your terminal:

  make OS=android NDK_BASE=/path/to/your/android-ndk-r10 build_all

Then you can find olsrd in the root, and the plugin files in lib/*/*.so*

If using NDK older than r10, you will need to set the NDK_COMPILER_VERSION to
4.4.3 since the default compiler version, 4.8, was not included until NDK r9.
Here's how:

  make OS=android NDK_BASE=/path/to/your/android-ndk-r7 \
       NDK_COMPILER_VERSION=4.4.3 build_all

Android App
-----------

As part of the Commotion project, there is an Android app being
developed to make it easy to install and run OLSR mesh networking on
Android devices.  This app is called Commotion Mesh Tether:
