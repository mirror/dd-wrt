with providing missing filesfrom Android NDK.)

Building olsrd for Android
--------------------------

In order to build olsrd and the plugins for Android, you will need to
download the free (as in beer, and mostly as in speech) Android NDK
(the pud plugin requires NDK r8, everything else you can build with r6
or maybe earlier):

http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html

Once you have that installed, run this in your terminal:

  make OS=android NDK_BASE=/path/to/your/android-ndk-r8 build_all

Then you can find olsrd in the root, and the plugin files in lib/*/*.so*


Android App
-----------

As part of the Commotion project, there is an Android app being
developed to make it easy to install and run OLSR mesh networking on
Android devices.  This app is called Commotion Mesh Tether:
