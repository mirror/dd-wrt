The jsoninfo plugin aims to deliver all of the information about the
runtime status and configuration of olsrd.  You can request specific
chunks of information, or overviews of runtime or startup
configuration, or all of the information in one report. Additionally,
the jsoninfo plugin will dump the current olsrd config in the
olsrd.conf format.  The jsoninfo plugin provides all of the
information that both the txtinfo and httpinfo plugins provide, as
well as quite a bit more.

There is a Java library called OlsrInfo that provides Java classes for
parsing the data from jsoninfo (and txtinfo also).  It is based on the
Jackson JSON processing library

PLUGIN USAGE
============

There are a number of commands for getting information from this
plugin.  They are designed to be tacked onto a URL, but can also be
sent directly via a network socket. The commands are similar to the
txtinfo plugin, but not exactly the same.

If there is no command or no recognized command, then it sends the
/status output, which is the combination of /neighbors, /links,
/routes, /hna, /mid, /topology, /gateways, and /interfaces.

grouped information:
* /all - all of the data in JSON format
* /runtime - all of the data that reflects the runtime status of olsrd and the mesh
* /startup - all of the data about the startup configuration

runtime information:
* /neighbors (including 2-hop)
* /links
* /routes
* /hna
* /mid
* /topology
* /gateways
* /interfaces
* /status - data that changes during runtime (all above commands combined)

start-up information:
* /config - the current configuration, i.e. what was loaded from the olsrd.conf
* /plugins - currently loaded plugins and their config parameters

start-up information not in JSON format:
* /olsrd.conf - the current config, formatted for writing directly to /etc/olsrd.conf


PLUGIN CONFIGURATION
====================

The plugin accepts two parameters: "port" and "accept". There are no
futher parameters.  Here's an example configuration for UNIX systems
(for Windows, change the plugin to end in .dll):

LoadPlugin "olsrd_jsoninfo.so.0.0"
{
    # the default port is 9090 but you can change it like this:
    #PlParam     "port"   "8080"

    # You can set a "accept" single address to allow to connect to
    # jsoninfo. If no address is specified, then localhost (127.0.0.1)
    # is allowed by default.  jsoninfo will only use the first "accept"
    # parameter specified and will ignore the rest.

    # to allow a specific host:
    #PlParam      "accept" "172.29.44.23"
    # if you set it to 0.0.0.0, it will accept all connections
    #PlParam      "accept" "0.0.0.0"

    # specify a UUID for this node to track it for debugging
    #PlParam      "UUIDFile" "/etc/olsrd/olsrd.uuid"
}


Example Usage
=============

You can use http URLs with various web tools to access the information:

  curl http://localhost:9090/all

You can combine the various commands to generate a custom report:

  curl http://localhost:9090/interfaces/routes/links

If you want a copy of the current configuration, you can download it
using this URL:

  wget http://localhost:9090/olsrd.conf
