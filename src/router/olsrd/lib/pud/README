    # nodeId contains the node identification. It first describes the semantics
    #        (meaning/code) of the identification and then specifies the node
    #        identification itself.
    #        For some codes the identification itself is not relevant and
    #        therefore ignored (specified if so).
    #
    #        The format is "number,identification"
    #
    #        "Number" is a number in the range 0-255, with the following
    #        meaning:
    #           0 : MAC address of sending interface
    #               (identification is not relevant)
    #           1 : an MSISDN number with 15 digits
    #           2 : a Tetra number with 17 digits
    #           3 : a DNS name
    #               (identification can be empty, in which case the hostname is
    #                used)
    #           4 : IPv4 address (OLSR main address) of the sending node
    #               (identification is not relevant)
    #           5 : an UUID number with 32 hexadecimal digits
    #           6 : IPv6 address (OLSR main address) of the sending node
    #               (identification is not relevant)
    #           7 : an AIS MMSI number with 9 digits
    #           8 : a URN number (a plain 24 bits number) with 8 digits. See
    #               http://www.dtic.mil/cjcs_directives/cdata/unlimit/3156_01.pdf
    #           9 : a MIP OID number with 20 digits. See

    # Note: setting "number" to 4 or 6 is the same for olsrd: both mean 'use
    #       the main IP address, which is either an IPv4 or an IPv6 address,
    #       depending on the IP version under which olsrd is run.
    #
    # Note: Both the number and the identification are transported over OLSR,
    #       so care must be taken to keep the size of the identification down.
