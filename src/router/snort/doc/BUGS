Security Related bug reports (evasions, overflows, etc) should be sent to 
bugs@snort.org and Marty Roesch <roesch@snort.org>.

Bug reports should be sent to bugs@snort.org and cc'd to
snort-devel@lists.snort.org (Snort Developers mailing list).

Please include the following information with your report:

System Architecture (Sparc, x86, etc)
Operating System and version (Linux 2.0.22, IRIX 5.3, etc)
Version of Snort
What preprocessors you loaded
What rules (if any) you were using
What output plug-ins you loaded
What command line switches you were using
Any Snort error messages

If you get a core file, here is a procedure that would be very
helpful for me to debug your problem faster.  When it crashes,
try the following steps:

1) At the command prompt, type 'gdb snort snort.core'.  This will
load snort and the core file into the GNU debugger.  You may need
to give the path to the snort binary file, and your core file might
have a different name (like "core" or something).

2) At the (gdb) prompt, type 'bt' (without the quotes).

3) At the (gdb) prompt, type 'quit'.  This will return you to your
shell.  

4) Cut and paste the output from gdb into the email you send me! 

If the problem could be reproduced, coredump analysis and snort output
of 'debug-enabled' build would be appreciated.


Hints:
To build debugging-enabled snort: 

make distclean; ./configure --enable-debug; make


If you are having trouble compiling, please try the following:

make distclean; aclocal; autoconf; automake

These solve a good percentange of autoconf portablity problems.


To debug some particular part of snort functionality:

export SNORT_DEBUG=<debuglevel> and run snort. See debug.h file
for details on debugging levels. (those could be combined, f.e.
if you want to see IP and TCP/UDP related info: debuglevel would
be: IPdebuglevel + TCPUDPdebuglevel)

Thanks!
