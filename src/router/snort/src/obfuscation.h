 * Callback to use for obfuscating payload or stream segments - see API below.
 *
 * The first chunk of a payload or stream segment whether needing obfuscation
 * or not will pass a valid pcap_pkthdr struct. Subsequent calls will pass NULL
 * for this structure.  This is useful, especially for the stream segment API
 * call to know when a new segment begins.  Any new "payload" will have a valid
 * pcap_pkthdr struct.
 *
 * If the slice sent in has a non-NULL packet data pointer, the data should *NOT*
 * be obfuscated.
 *
 * If the chunk sent in has a NULL packet data pointer, then that chunk of data
 * should be obfuscated with the obfuscation character.
 *
 * The length passed in is the amount of data that should be copied from the
 * packet data pointer or the amount of data that should be written with the
 * obfuscation character.
 *
 * Arguments
 *  DAQ_PktHdr_t *pkth
 *   The pcap header that contains the packet caplen and timestamps
 *  uint8_t *packet_data
 *   A pointer to the current offset into the packet data.  NULL if
 *   obfuscation of the payload slice is required.
 *  ob_char_t ob_char
 *   The obfuscation character to use if packet_data is NULL.
 *  ob_size_t length
 *   The amount of data to be logged or obfuscated.
 *  void *user_data
 *   The user data passed in to the API functions obfuscatePayload() or
 *   obfuscateStreamSegments below.
 *
 * Returns
 *  OB_RET_SUCCESS  if all is good
 *  OB_RET_ERROR  if the rest of the obfuscation should not be done
