/*
   The trie is represented by an array and each node consists of an
   unsigned word. The first 5 bits (31-27) indicate the logarithm
   of the branching factor. The next 5 bits (26-22) indicate the
   skip value. The final 22 (21-0) bits is an adress, either to
   another internal node, or the base vector.
   The maximum capacity is 2^21 strings (or a few more). The trie
   is prefixfree. All strings that are prefixes of another string
   are stored separately.
