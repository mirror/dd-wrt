  * src/output-plugins/: spo_alert_fast.c:
  * src/preprocessors/Stream5/: stream5_common.c:
      Updated portscan to set protocol correctly in raw packet for
      IPv6 and changed the encoder to recognize portscan packets as pseudo
	  packets so that the checksum isn't calculated

Snort 2.9.0.5
  * src/build.h:
      Increment Snort build number to 132
  * src/snort.c:
  * src/preprocessors/: normalize.c, perf-base.c, perf-base.h,
    Stream5/snort_stream5_tcp.c:
      TCP timestamp options are only NOPed by the Normalization preprocessor
      if Stream5 has seen a full 3-way handshake, and timestamps weren't
      negotiated.

      The IPS mode reassembly policy has been refactored to do stream
      normalization within the first policy.

      Packets injected by the normalization preprocessor are now counted
      in the packet statistics.
  * doc/snort_manual.tex:
  * src/: parser.c, parser.h:
  * src/preprocessors/: spp_frag3.c, Stream5/snort_stream5_session.c:
      Added a "config vlan_agnostic" setting that globally disables Stream's
      use of vlan tag in session tracking.
  * src/: snort.c, preprocessors/normalize.c,
    preprocessors/spp_normalize.c, preprocessors/spp_normalize.h,
    preprocessors/perf-base.c, preprocessors/perf-base.h:
  * doc/: README.normalize, snort_manual.pdf, snort_manual.tex:
      Fixed the normalization preprocessor to call its post-initialization
      config functions during a policy reload.

      Packets can no longer be trimmed below the minimum ethernet frame
      length. Trimming is now configurable with the "normalize_ip4: trim;"
      option. TOS clearing is now configurable with "normalize_ip4: tos;".

      The "normalize_ip4: trim" option is automatically disabled if the
      DAQ can't inject packets. If the DAQ tries and fails to inject
      a given packet, the wire packet is not blocked.

      Updated documentation regarding these changes.
  * src/detection-plugins/sp_cvs.c: 
      Fixed a false positive in the CVS detection plugin. It was incorrectly
      parsing CVS entries that had a '+' in between the 3rd and 4th slashes.
  * src/preprocessors/HttpInspect/: client/hi_client.c,
    server/hi_server.c: 
      Changed a pointer comparison to a size check for code readability.
      Belated thanks to Dwane Atkins and Parker Crook for reporting a
      related issue that was fixed in Snort 2.9.0.4 build 111.

      Moved the zlib initialization such that gzipped responses are still
      inspected if the zipped data starts after the first Stream-reassembled
      packet is inspected.
  * src/decode.c: 
      Fixed an issue with decoding too many IP layers in a single packet. The
      Teredo proto bit was not unset after hitting the limit on IP layers.
      Thanks to Dwane Atkins for reporting this issue.

      IPv6 fragmented packets are no longer inspected unless they have an
      offset of zero and the next layer is UDP. This behavior is consistent
      with IPv4 decoding.
      Thanks to Martin Schütte for reporting an issue where fragged ICMPv6
      packets were being inspected.

      The decoder no longer attempts to decode Teredo packets inside of
      IPv4 fragments, instead waiting for the reassembled packet.
  * src/encode.c: 
      Fixed a problem where encoded packets had their lengths calculated
      incorrectly. This caused the active response feature to generate
      incorrect RST packets if the original packet had a VLAN tag.
  * preproc_rules/preprocessor.rules: 
      Updated references to rule 125:1:1 
  * src/preprocessors/spp_perfmonitor.c:
      Perfmonitor files are now created after Snort changes uid/gid.
  * src/dynamic-plugins/sf_preproc_example/sf_dynamic_preproc_lib.c:
      Fixed the size formatting of an error message argument when
      compiling with --enable-rzb-saac.
      Thanks to Cleber S. Brandão for reporting this issue.
  * etc/snort.conf:
      Updated the default snort.conf with max compress and decompress
      depths to enable unlimited decompression of gzipped HTTP responses.
  * snort.8:
      Fixed the man page's URL regarding the location of Snort rules.
      Thanks to Michael Scheidell for reporting an out-of-date man page section.
  * doc/README.http_inspect, doc/snort_manual.tex,
    src/preprocessors/snort_httpinspect.c:
      HTTP Inspect's "unlimited_decompress" option now requires that
      "compress_depth" and "decompress_depth" are set to their max values.
  * src/: fpcreate.c, dynamic-plugins/sf_dynamic_define.h,
    dynamic-plugins/sf_dynamic_engine.h,
    preprocessors/Stream5/snort_stream5_tcp.c:
      Fixed an error that prevented compiling with --disable-dynamicplugin.
      Thanks to Jason Wallace for reporting this issue.
  * src/dynamic-preprocessors/ftptelnet/: snort_ftptelnet.c,
    snort_ftptelnet.h, spp_ftptelnet.c:
      Changed the names of ProcessGlobalConf() and PrintGlobalConf() inside
      the ftp_telnet preprocessor to avoid a naming conflict with similar
      functions in HTTP Inspect.
      Thanks to Bruce Corwin for reporting this issue.
  * src/preprocessors/: perf.c, perf-base.c, perf-base.h, perf-flow.c,
    perf-flow.h:
      Fixed comparisons between signed and unsigned int, which lead to
      a faulty length check.
      Thanks to Cihan Ayyildiz and Jason Wallace for helping us debug this
      issue.

Snort 2.9.0.4
  * src/build.h: Increment Snort build number to 110
  * snort.8, src/snort.c: 
    Updated Snort man page to match the output of "snort --help".
    Removed "-o" from the list of valid options, since it was removed
    a while ago.
    The verdict from defragged packets are no longer cleared, so that
    they can be applied to the raw packet.
    Thanks to Markus Lude for submitting a patch that fixed errors in the
    man page.
  * src/fpcreate.c:
    Deletec the call to fpDeletePortGroup() prior to calling FatalError().
  * src/parser.c:
    Fixed portvar parsing code to correctly dislpay names of undefined
    portvars.
  * src/preprocessors/Stream5/snort_stream5_tcp.c: 
    Fixed a FIN sequence number handling issue, where RST after FIN caused a
    false positive on Stream5 preprocessor rule 129:15. 
    Thanks to Jason Wallace for pointing out the issue.
  * doc/: INSTALL, README.frag3, README.http_inspect, README.stream5,
    snort_manual.tex, snort_manual.pdf:

    src/dynamic-preprocessors/rzb_saac/spp_rzb-saac.c: 
    Added Razorback SaaC to the dynamic-preprocessors.
    Use --enable-rzb-saac to build it.  Moved the initgroups call to a
    separate function and call it from the main thread.	
  * src/detection-plugins/sp_clientserver.c: 
    Fixed an erroneous error check so that "no_frag" and "no_stream" can be
    used in the same "flow" rule option.
  * src/detection-plugins/sp_pattern_match.c:
    Rules that use a "depth" value lower than the length of their content
    now cause an error. Depth should be >= the content length.
  * src/detection-plugins/sp_tcp_flag_check.c:
    Changed the reserved bits flags "1, 2" to "C, E". The old values can still
    be used for backwards compatability.
  * preproc_rules/preprocessor.rules: 
    Added references to FTP and SMTP preprocessor rules.  
  * src/dynamic-plugins/sf_engine/examples/: detection_lib_meta.h:
    Removed extraneous ifdef
  * src/: preprocessors/spp_frag3.c, preprocessors/spp_sfportscan.c,
    dynamic-preprocessors/dcerpc2/dce2_config.c: 
    Added startup log message to show that the preprocessors are
    inactive when added to snort.conf as "disabled".
    Updated frag3 startup log to indicate the memcap frmo which prealloc
    fragments were generated.
  * src/preprocessors/: spp_frag3.c, Stream5/snort_stream5_session.c:
    Updated the Frag3KeyCmp and Stream5KeyCmp functions to handle 32bit
    sparc platforms where 64bit pointer comparisons can cause bus
    errors. Thanks to Stephan for reporting this issue.
  * src/: preprocessors/portscan.c, win32/WIN32-Includes/config.h:
    Portscan preprocessor's hash table is now allocated based on
    the memcap, instead of being the same size.
  * src/dynamic-preprocessors/dcerpc2/: dce2_co.c, dce2_utils.c, dce2_smb.c:
    Fixed a bug that caused dcerpc2 to reassemble some segments incorrectly.
    If extra bytes at the end of a request corrupt the next request, they
    will be discarded.
  * src/dynamic-preprocessors/ssl/spp_ssl.c:
    Updated the SSL preproc to count the packets it processes,
    instead of counting all packets to enter the intiial function.
  * doc/: faq.tex, faq.pdf: 
    Updated FAQ based on snort.org reorganization.  
  * doc/: README.http_inspect, snort_manual.pdf, snort_manual.tex:
    Updated cookie documentation.
    Cookie buffer includes "Cookie" header name for HTTP requests and
    "Set-Cookie" for HTTP responses. When enable_cookie is disabled,
    cookie buffer points to the HTTP header 
  * src/preprocessors/snort_httpinspect.c: 
    Fixed the error message during parsing of HTTP inspect
    server config. Make it a warning.

      Fixed a false positive due to a large chunk length followed
      by a small packet.
      Moved the lookup table such that they are initialized only once.
      When de-chunking returns error, the data is now inspected as a
      normal body.
      Moved the Initialize function out of hi_ui_config.h.
      CRLFs are no longer placed in the status message buffer.

    * src/preprocessors/Stream5/snort_stream5_tcp.c:
          fix file_data:mime in So rules. content matches following
          file_data:mime should not enter fast pattern matcher. Reset file_data_ptr once
          stream flush is done and stream reassembled packet is processed.

          Fix return value for SSL rule options         
    * src/: plugbase.h, preprocessors/snort_httpinspect.c:
          Set the dce preproc bit in HTTP only when server flow depth is -1
    * src/dynamic-preprocessors/dcerpc2/: dce2_co.c, dce2_smb.c,
      dce2_utils.c, dce2_utils.h, includes/smb.h:

          Fixed an error in the handling of HTTP Session Data.
    * doc/: README.http_inspect,snort_manual.pdf, snort_manual.tex:
          Update to the snort manual. remove the stream5
          alerts. reference the gen-msg.map.
    * preprocessors/Stream5/snort_stream5_tcp.c:
          urgent pointer handling corrected for one
          byte of urgent data at the start of a segment.  The general case
          of an N-byte urgent payload prefix would be handled here by
          removing the == 1 limit in urg_offset == 1 but that restrictio
          is not safe until we flush urgent data.  As is, urgent data is
          never flushed in reassembled packets and can only be detected i
          raw packets.
          pointer handling.
    * src/: decode.h, detection_util.h, plugbase.h,
      preprocessors/snort_httpinspect.c,
      preprocessors/snort_httpinspect.h,
      preprocessors/HttpInspect/server/hi_server.c,
          Apply server flow depth on a session basis
          rather than per packet basis.  This change improves the
          performance by disabling detect on packet when the packet is
          beyond the specified flow depth. server_flow_depth now takes
          values from -1 to 65535
    * src/parser.c:
          Correct setting of dup_opt_func and cleanup existing opt_func list before
          hand to address parse-time leak.

      Fixed a bug where Stream5 reassembled on all ports when sfportscan was in
      snort.conf, but in a "disabled" state.
      Added a preprocessor rule option, enabled by Stream5. The syntax is
      "reassembly: <on|off>,<client|server|both> [,noalert]". It enables/disables
      Stream reassembly for the session that matches the rule.

Snort 2.9.0 RC
    * Fixed clean shutdown after reload.
    * Fixed tagging to log tagged packets regardless of filtering.
    * Fixed mempool initialization of free list count bug reported by
      zhangz@risinginfo.com.
    * Snort resized packets are now dropped and injected as required by DAQs.
    * Fixed Snort I/O Totals reporting injected packets with IPFW when NO
      packets are injected externally.
    * Tweaked Snort's dynamic preprocessor example.
    * More informative dynamic preprocessor loading error messages.
    * Added preprocessor alerts added to alert when Snort sees a client hello
      after a server hello or when Snort sees a server hello without a client
      hello when trustservers is disabled.   
    * Documentation Updates: Updates to HTTP inspect README and Snort Manual.
    * Added parser error to fragoffset: Error when !, < and > operators are
      used with each other.
    * Updated README for daq with updated information on firewalls with FreeBSD
      and OpenBSD
    * Added more complete error checking to "byte_extract" rule option parsing.
    * The Sensitive Data preprocessor no longer searches HTTP headers for PII, as
      this introduced unnecessary false positives. In addition, the
      "us_social_nodashes" rule is now off by default to avoid false positives.
    * Added a new decoder alert for IPv6 extension headers that don't follow the
      RFC's recommended order.
    * Fixed a bug in the validation of IPv6 option lengths.
    * Fixed a bug in the normalization of HTTP responses with both gzipped
      Content-Encoding and chunked Transfer-Encoding.
    * Teredo packets with another layer of UDP on top will now display the correct
      port numbers in console output.
    * Reduced false positives on decoder alerts when "config deep_teredo_inspection"
      is enabled.
    * Fixed a problem with evaulating UDP rules on Teredo traffic, where the result
      of rule evaluation on the outer UDP
    * Changed the default search methond in snort.conf from "ac-bnfa" to "ac-split".

Snort 2.9.0 Beta
    * Snort uses the DAQ library for packet acquisition and injection. 
      ./configure --enable-inline and --enable-ipfw are deleted.  Just run ./snort
      -Q to activate inline mode for DAQs that support it.  See the README.daq there
      for more.
    * A normalizer preprocessor has been added to help minimize evasion vectors.
      Use ./configure --enable-normalizer to build and config normalize_* to
      enable.  See README.normalize for more.
    * Flexresp and flexresp2 have been replaced with a new flexresp3 module that
      supports the rule keywords from each.  ./configure --enable-flexresp
      --enable-flexresp2 are deprecated.
    * The react rule option has been rewritten to correct a number of issues.  You
      can also customize the injected content with config react.  Use ./configure
      --enable-react to build.
    * config min_ttl is now policy specific.  You can also set a normalization
      value with config new_ttl.
    * Snort has a new active response capability.  Build it with ./configure
      --enable-active-response.  This mode enables automatically sending TCP resets
      and ICMP unreachables.  See README.active for more.
    * Passive mode Snort can now inject packets for drop, sdrop, and reject rules.
      In addition, block and sblock rules have been added as synonyms for drop and
      sdrop to help avoid confusion between dropped packets and blocked packets.
      Configure with config response.
    * Snort shutdown output now includes new counts so you can see if any events
      are not being reported due to event queue and pattern matching
      configurations.  Also, ./configure --enable-timestats has been eliminated but
      the shutdown output of packet rates has been made standard.
    * BPFs can be written for IPv6.
    * ./snort -T has bee expanded to validate more than just the conf.  For
      example, you can now validate BPFs.
    * Snort no longer depends on libnet and uses libdnet instead.
    * Added the "byte_extract" detection option. This saves bytes from the packet
      into variables for use by other options.
    * Added support for byte_extract variables in the following rule options
      * content (offset, depth, distance, within)
      * byte_test (offset, comparison value)
      * byte_jump (offset)
      * isdataat (offset)
    * Added decoder support for Teredo tunneling (IPv6 over UDP over IPv4).
    * Added decoder support for Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) with NULL encryption.
    * Added 18 decoder rules for different types of malformed IPv6 headers.
    * Moved 24 content-less rules into the packet decoder.
    * The Sensitive Data preprocessor now prints its configuration on startup.
    * Fixed the Snort RPM so that it installs the Sensitive Data preprocessor.
    * Updated the description of the "-h" option in the Snort help output.
    * Added a tools directory, with "u2boat" and "u2spewfoo". These programs can be 
      used to turn Unified2 files into pcaps and console output, respectively.
    * Replaced Unified with Unified2 in snort.conf.
    * Moved the rules/ directory into its own separate tarball.
    * Snort will print encapsulated layers in text output.
    * Initial iteration of DCE/RPC preprocessor removed.
    * SO rule updates.  Updated storeRuleData() and getRuleData() API
      functions.  Added dynamic allocation functions allocRuleData() and
      freeRuleData() mainly for data stored on a stream session and to
      utilize a new configuration option to put a memcap on the amount of
      data SO rules allocate.
    * Fixed possible non-runtime memory leak in SO rule preprocessor rule
      options.
    * Added negation support to SSL preprocessor rule options ssl_state and
      ssl_version
    * Added support for Intel's Soft CPM for use as a fast pattern matcher.
    * Fixed issue when specifying a --pcap-dir where Snort would fatal
      error if there was a broken symbolic link under the directory.
    * Fixed an issue where copying an SO rule stub to modify the rule
      action, IPs and/or ports didn't work as expected.
    * Set state in SSL preprocessor even if record is truncated.
    * Fixed inconsistency with flowbits behaviour if stream session timed
      out.  stream5 now resets flowbits on a timeout.
    * Snort will now fatal error if adaptive profiles is enabled in any
      policy other than the default policy.
    * Fixed false positives caused by using the fast_pattern option with
      the "only" argument on an http content in a rule.
    * Fix OpenBSD compile with --enable-prelude.
    * Fixed issue in SO rules converted to text rules that were not
      setting mutliplier correctly.
    * Fixed inconsistencies in behaviour with user defined rule types.
    * Snort will now throw validation error for ipvar definition with
      negated ip list that is more general that other ip list in
      definition.
    * Added support for IP variable substitution.
    * Created new decoder event for ICMP PATH MTU denial of service
      attempt.
    * Fixed SSL preprocessor to potentially update state before
      reassmebled packet is decoded.
    * Added a new argument "mime" to the detection option "file_data".
      This argument will set the doe_ptr to the start of the base64 decoded
      MIME attachment. New config options "enable_mime_decoding", "max_mime_depth"
      and "max_mime_mem" are added to SMTP configuration to support this feature.
    * Added the "base64_decode" and "base64_data" detection option.
      The "base64_decode" decodes the base64 encoded data. The "base64_data"
      points the doe_ptr to the start of the base64 decoded buffer.
    * Added a new mode "inline-test". This mode simulates the inline mode of snort,
      allowing evaluation of inline behavior without affecting traffic. The command
      line option --enable-inline-test and snort config option policy_mode:inline_test
      added to support this feature. The drop rules will be loaded and will be
      triggered as a Wdrop (Would Drop) alert.
    * Added the support to extract the original client IP from the X-Forwarded-For
      or True-Client-IP headers. This client IP will now be logged to the unified2
      output when HTTP Inspect is configured with enable_xff.
    * Added support to u2spewfoo to read the Orginal Client IP, Wdrop Alerts, Gzip decompressed Data.
    * Added support to print the Gzip decompressed data with cmg output.

      part of stream reassembly refer to the original event directly from
      the packet record header.
    * src/sfutil/sfportobject.c:
    * src/sfutil/sfportobject.h:
      Code cleanup and free data correctly on parsing errors.

      Added support to provide action control (alert, drop, pass, etc)
      over preprocessor and decoder generated events, as well as references
      and classifications via a rule.  These rules do not include IP
      addresses as the individual preprocessor/decoder configuration
      dictates the traffic to which an event applies.  In conjunction
      with this, certain post-processing rule options (tag, logto, etc)
      may be added to those rules, while other options that relate to data
      inspection (content, byte_test, etc) may not.  Enable via 
      --enable-decoder-preprocessor-rules option to configure.

      Improve performance of pattern match engines to not evaluate a rule
      with a pattern that has already been seen and the rule already
      processed.  This changes takes into account if that rule fails because of
      an unset flowbit (which may have been set by another rule).  Changed hash
      table hash functions to use power of two computations instead of prime
      numbers.
    * src/util.c:
      Added PCRE library version information to Snort startup banner.

      received by Snort, causing snort to dereference an invalid pointer.

      response, stream reassembled or not and that rules written to inspect
      more than flow_depth bytes will be ineffective.  Thanks to Christian

      Added target-based support for processing of TCP timestamps, TCP
      Resets, and repeated SYN packets.  Improved Session cache management.
      Update flushpoint management.  Improved handling of midstream
      session establishment.  Code cleanup to use safe functions for
      memory allocation.  Set tcp policy for both sides of session,
      rather that by first packet seen, correctly does target-based
      reassembly for each side.  Simplify code handling sessions to ignore.

    * src/decode.c:
    * src/decode.h:
      Fixed issue where GRE decoder was attempting to assign a potentially
      negative value to an unsigned integer.  This value, which would then
      be positive, was then checked to see if it was less than zero, which
      would indicate whether the calculated length of the header was greater
      than the length of the rest of the packet capture.  This would always
      return false and the assumed length of the packet would potentially
      be larger than the actual length, leading to a potential dereferning
      of invalid memory.  Thanks to Chris Rohlf for pointing this out.

    * RELEASE.NOTES:
      Prepare for 2.6.1 RC.
    * configure.in:
    * src/parser.c:
    * src/snort.c:
    * src/snort.h:
      Start a thread if running in inline mode that passes traffic through
      once pcap is opened and snort is not ready to start inspection (ie,
      loading rules, creating pattern matcher, etc).  Thread is terminated
      when snort is ready to process packets.
      Compiled in via --enable-inline-init-failopen option to configure
      script.  Disable by --disable-inline-init-failopen commandline option or
      'config disable_inline_init_failopen' in snort.conf/user.conf in the
      case that the interface is fail-closed.  Requires libpthread.
    * src/parser.c:
      Require a sid for every rule.
    * src/dynamic-preprocessors/ssh/spp_ssh.c:
      Verifies that the stream preprocessor is enabled.
      Version string bounds checking now uses the length of the version
      string versus the length of the entire payload.
    * src/preprocessors/snort_stream4_udp.c:
      Update UDP session stats (packet count, start/end time, bytes, etc).
    * doc/README.stream4:
    * doc/Makefile.am:
      Finally a description for Stream4.  Thanks Todd!
    * src/parser.c:

      rmkml and Crusoe Researchers for notifying us of the issue.
    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c:
    * src/generators.h:
    * etc/gen-msg.map:
      Fix Stream4 to handle duplicate SYN packets by purging existing
      packets queued for reassembly after the seq of the SYN.  Also,
      properly handle retransmitted data that is overlapping the current
      packet and when trimmed overlapping the next packet.

2006-10-04 Steven Sturges <ssturges@sourcefire.com>
    * src/decode.c:
      Fixed issue in GRE code where data could
      potentially be dereferenced past the end

      Split the IIS profile in the HTTP inspect preprocessor into
      IIS, ISS4, and ISS5_0.  ISS 4.0 and ISS 5.0  both support double
      decoding, but ISS 5.1 and beyond do not.  Double decoding alerts
      are now disabled in the ISS profile, but remain enabled for the
      IIS 4.0 and IIS 5.0 profiles.  Thanks to Pratap Ramamurthy for
      pointing out that IIS 5.1 does not support double decoding

    * src/util.h:
      Fixed issue where iface_ADDRESS variable wasn't getting set before
      configuration file was read. Now all up interfaces will get a
      variable created.  Note that these will NOT get set if the
      readmode flag is set.  Thanks to Paul Melson for reporting the
      problem.
    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c:
    * src/preprocessors/stream.h:
      Handle reassembly of first packet for midstream pickups (first packet
      wasn't part of an established session at that point, so some rules
      might fail).
    * src/preprocessors/Stream5/snort_stream5_session.c:
      Fix handling of cache clean by percent.
    * src/detection-plugins/sp_pattern_match.c:
    * src/detection-plugins/sp_pattern_match.h:

      oversized chunk alerts.
    * src/sfutil/ipobj.c:
      Fix parsing that prevented multiple IP lists from being parsed
      correctly.  This fixes a problem with sfportscan configuration when
      'watch_ip', 'ignore_scanners', and 'ignore_scanned' options are
      used together.  Thanks to Rob Sharp and Husnu Demir for reporting
      the bug.

    * configure.in:
      GCC 4.x.x has strict aliasing on by default with optimization level 2.
      However, Snort uses aliases in a number of places.  configure now checks
      the gcc compiler version for 4 and disables strict aliasing with
      -fno-strict-aliasing.  Thanks to Ronald Henderson and Keith Konecnik
      for simultaneously (and independently) discovering and reporting this
      issue.

      Fix to print original datagram on alert if original datagram was ICMP.
      Thanks to John Papapanos for pointing out the above 2 issues.
      Added additional decoder alerts for ICMP error types.
      Removed fragtracking of ICMP original datagram - it never made sense
      since only an ICMP response to the first frag is ever returned.
      Fixed issue where data and size pointers were not set correctly for
      ICMP error types.

      this is now handled within the general alerting mechanism
      and session tracking.
    * src/parser.c:
      When a variable was redefined, a call to LogMessage() was missing a

      Addressed some startup issues when running daemon mode.
      Configuration is validated prior to daemonizing, therefore
      if config errors exist, snort will exit, returning error to
      initialization script/process.  Parent process doesn't exit
      until config file is read and a child is forked and has
      created its pid file.  Thanks to Marc Norton and Chris Sherwin
      for their work on this.
      Fixed issue with opening pcap prior to reading it from a
      config file.  Thanks Martin Olsson for noting this.

2005-09-16 mfr <roesch@sourcefire.com>
    * src/snort.c:
      New command line switch, -K, to explicitly set logging mode.  Available
      arguments are "none", "pcap" and "ascii".
      Pcap mode is now the default logging mode of Snort.
      CheckLogDir() is no longer called in IDS mode until after reading in
      the snort.conf file to prevent unncessary exiting due to logdir being
      specified in snort.conf and inadvertantly checking for the existence
      of /var/log/snort.
    * src/util.c:
      Included CheckLogDir() call in CreatePidFile() on the off chance
      we have to fall back to using pv.log_dir which can happen due to
      the IDS mode logdir check being removed in src/snort.c
    * src/decode.c:
      Added check for bad length of TCP SACK option.
    * snort.8:
      Updated for -K command line switch

      Additional fixes to better handle various targets and extensions to
      the Shankar/Paxson model.  Thanks Judy Novak for all of the OS
      testing & pcap work.

      Previously, each Frag3 Policy would result in a separate
      preprocessor instance.  Also fixed use of ttl_limit option.

      Fixed issue with snort not properly decoding ppp links on MacOS X.
      Thanks Allan Jensen for reporting this and working with us on the
      fix (Roelker).

2004-12-14 Jeremy Hewlett <jh@sourcefire.com>

    * doc/README.http_inspect:
      Updated documentation on flow_depth and HTTP headers per
      conversations with Joe Patterson. Thanks Joe!

    * src/preprocessors/spp_arpspoof.c:
      Added variable names to function prototypes and made cosmetic
      changes to debug messages.  In ARPspoofHostInit() fixed a problem
      where the list of configured IP/MAC entries would contain only one
      entry and leaked memory.  In DetectARPattacks() made a small
      performance improvement by eliminating a copy of the ARP source
      protocol (IP) address (Jeff Nathan).

    * src/snort.h:
    * src/snort.c:
    * src/parser.c:
      Fixed a problem affecting MacOS X where linking may fail with
      non-standard libraries when global symbols are encountered multiple
      times. Removed duplicate globals and externed globals in headers.
      Defined globals in source. Made sure frag2 is only linked once
      (Jeff Nathan).

    * src/inline.c:
    * src/parser.c:
    * src/snort.c:
    * src/snort.h:
      If the 'Q' option (inline) is set, set a global variable that can
      be used externally.

    * src/preprocessors/snort_httpinspect.c:
      Update error message when IIS Unicode map file is not found.

    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c:
      Ignore RST|ACK midstream pickup case so we don't get an evasive TCP
      alert.  Thanks for the report, Sekure.

    * src/util.c:
    * src/util.h:
    * src/snort.c:
      Change SanityChecks() to CheckLogDir() so the function name now
      makes sense.  Move CheckLogDir() to after parsing snort.conf (for
      IDS mode), so the logdir config will work if the default or
      command-line logdir does not exist on the system.

2004-11-19 Steven Sturges <ssturges@sourcefire.com>

    * src/preprocessors/spp_telnet_negotiation.c:
      Fixed issues with how telnet options are handled.

2004-11-18 Steve Sturges <ssturges@sourcefire.com>

    * src/detection-plugins/sp_pcre.c:
      Fixed bug when setting the doe_ptr on a successful pcre match.
      It is now set relative to base_ptr.

    * src/detection-plugins/sp_byte_jump.c:
      Added from_beginning and multiplier options for byte_jump.
      from_beginning skips bytes from the beginning of the content,
      instead of from the location immediately following the number
      of bytes to skip.  multiplier takes a numeric argument, and
      skips x times that number of bytes.

    * src/detect.c:
    * src/detect.h:
    * src/log.c:
      In "fast" output, now log only actual packet contents when UDP
      data length is greater than actual data length. Thanks Brian
      Caswell for spotting this.

2004-11-04 Jeremy Hewlett <jh@sourcefire.com>

    * configure.in:
      Added --enable-64bit-gcc to set up the build environment for 64bit
      (tested only on Solaris9). Still are some memory alignment issues
      to work out before 64bit mode is fully functional, Patches are
      welcomed. Thanks Chris Baker for doing 64bit testing.

    * src/sfutil/sfmemcap.c:
      Better support for 64bit Snort (mnorton).

2004-11-04 Andrew Mullican <amullican@sourcefire.com>

    * src/output-plugins/spo_unified.c:
      Fixed reference times to match log time for first packet, for an event
      generated by a reassembled packet.  Incremented event ID to give 
      unique ID for each packet.  Also made unified logging compatible with 
      Windows.

2004-11-02 Jeremy Hewlett <jh@sourcefire.com>

    * configure.in:
      Changed linking order of libmysqlclient.

    * src/detection-plugins/sp_rpc_check.c:
    * src/preprocessors/spp_frag2.c:
    * src/sfutil/acsmx2.c:
      Fixes for compilation on 64-bit Solaris.  Snort 2_3 branch compiles
      cleanly (jhewlett, mnorton). Should be a few more changes coming
      shortly.

    * src/plugbase.c:
      Compilation fix for AIX. Thanks Markus Waldeck.

    * src/preprocessors/perf-base.c:
    * src/preprocessors/perf-base.h:
    * src/preprocessors/perf.c:

      perfmonitor config line can now be configured with accumulate or
      reset. (mnorton). Thanks Barry Basselgia for pointing out the issue.
      Thanks Scott Dexter and Andreas Ostling for doing some initial
      testing.

2004-10-21 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/preprocessors/HttpInspect/client/hi_client.c:
      Don't include the version string length as part of the
      directory length.  Caused some false positives if the oversize
      directory length was set to small numbers.  Thanks Jeremy
      Hewlett for catching this one.

    * src/preprocessors/HttpInspect/session_inspection/hi_si.c:
    * src/preprocessors/snort_httpinspect.c:
      Fix false positives that were occurring on some events.  Thanks
      to Vjay Larosa for the report.

    * src/preprocessors/perf-base.c:
    * src/preprocessors/sfprocpidstats.c:
      Fix linux perfmonitoring stats for the 2.6 kernel.  Thanks to 
      everyone that reported this bug. 

    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c:
    * src/preprocessors/stream.h:
      Add an enforce_state keyword to stream4 so we won't pick up midstream
      sessions.  This works well for asynchronous links and also for
      just monitoring legitimate traffic.  

2004-10-13 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/detect.c:
      Fix suppression/thresholding bug for non-rule alerts.  Thanks to
      Alex Butcher for reporting it to us.

2004-10-05 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/parser.c:
      Fix bug in preprocessor error statement that referenced freed
      memory.  Thanks to Dennis George for submitting fix.

    * src/detection-plugins/sp_pattern_match.c:
      Fix content option modifiers so that they check the option specified
      and not offset.  Thanks to Petr Kurtin for pointing out this bug.

2004-10-04 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/decode.c:
      Fix TCP/IP options print bug that was found by Marcin Zgorecki.

    * src/plugbase.c:
      Move portscan initialization into preprocessors, not plugins.

    * preprocessors/portscan.c:
      Inspect invalid TCP initiators that stream4 doesn't track for portscans.
      Log open ports on TCP portsweeps when we can.  Thanks to #snort and
      SGUIL guys for their comments and feedback.  Also, thanks to David
      Lowless for his portscan testing in the UK.

2004-09-20 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/util.c:
      Fix ts_print to work correctly for localtime logging.

    * src/fpdetect.c:
      Thresholded drop/sdrop rules should still drop the packet, but we
      just won't alert on them.  Thanks to Brian Starrfield for finding
      this bug.

2004-09-17 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/detect.c:
      Fix tagging issue that would tag rebuilt TCP streams, which for most
      output plugins this means we just relog the packets that we've
      already logged.  Thanks Jeremy Hewlett and Daniel Cid for finding
      this bug.

    * src/event_queue.c:
    * src/event_queue.h:
      Only flush a TCP stream on rule alerts and not on preprocessor alerts.
      Thanks Jeremy Hewlett and Daniel Cid for finding this bug.

    * src/detection_plugins/sp_react.c:
    * src/detection_plugins/sp_react.h:

      with sp_respond2 (Jeff Nathan).

    * src/detection_plugins/sp_respond.c:
    * src/detection_plugins/sp_respond.h:

2004-09-08 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/decode.c:
      Drop bad checksums if we're in inline mode and we're doing checksums.
      Thanks to William Metcalf and Victor Julien for this patch.

    * doc/CREDITS:
      Updated CREDITS with some major SourceFire contributors that were
      not mentioned.

2004-09-07 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/inline.c:
    * src/inline.h:
    * src/parser.c:
    * src/snort.c:
    * src/snort.h:
      Make reject rule type work with linux bridging.  Added config option
      'layer2resets', which by default uses the interface specified by
      the ipq packet.  In addition, you can also specify a src mac address
      so the sensor interface information is not apparent.  Thanks to 
      William Metcalf and Victor Julien for this feature.

2004-09-02 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/detect.c:
    * src/fpdetect.c:
    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c:
      Add inline state configuration for stream4, so we will drop packets that
      are not part of an existing TCP session and are not valid TCP
      initiators.  Thanks Will Metcalf and Victor Julien for the initial
      implementation.  Add functionality for drop/sdrop rules that will still
      drop a packet if the rule specifies "flow: established".  We silently
      drop the packet, so as not to be DOS'd by stick/snot attacks.  If the
      user wants the alerts, then add in the stream4 configuration of
      'midstream_drop_alerts'.

    * src/rules.h:
    * src/detection_plugins/sp_clientserver.c:
      Add not_established keyword to the flow detection option.  This allows
      snort to do dynamic firewall rulesets.  Experimental for now, so if
      any wants to try let me know.

    * src/preprocessors/snort_httpinspect.c:
      Fix conditions where snort would log double web alerts that contained
      only content options (no uricontents).  Thanks to kawa for finding and
      reporting this bug.

2004-08-31 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/fpdetect.c:
      If InlineMode() is set, than the flow: established check will also
      look to see if the TCP stream was picked up in midstream.  If it was,
      then we assume it's established.  This also blocks packets that are
      generated by stick/snot type attacks, whereas before these packets
      were just being passed through because flow: established was not valid.

2004-08-27 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/sfutil/sfmemcap.c:
      Fix 64-bit bug found and tested by Ryan Matteson (matty91@bellsouth.net)
      and Clay McClure (clay@daemons.net).  Thanks guys.

    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c:
    * src/preprocessors/snort_httpinspect.c:
      When we pick up TCP sessions in midstream, don't use stream4 direction
      to tell us how to inspect client and server traffic.  Performance
      enhancement for some sites.

    * src/preprocessors/portscan.c:
      Add more comments and make portscan detail printouts more readable.

2004-08-20 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/util.c:
      Make ts_print work correctly with timezones.  Thanks to Dagobert
      Kellner for the fix.

2004-08-19 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/util.c:
      Log an error when the user tries to setuid/gid and snort is being
      run in inline.  Thanks Matt Brannigan for finding this bug.

2004-08-13 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/detection-plugins/sp_pattern_match.c:
      Ignore replace rule options when snort isn't in GIDS mode. (Roelker)

    * src/decode.h:
    * src/detect.h:
      Set a packet_flag for drop alerts.  This lets the output plugins
      know that we just dropped the packet that we logged.  (Roelker)

2004-08-11 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/inline.c:
    * src/spo_unified.c:
      Make inline alerts work with unified output.  Thanks for the help
      in unified format Andrew Baker.

    * src/util.c:
      Added ASCII pig (thanks Dug Song) and snort team to snort initialization 
      printout.

    * src/output-plugins/spo_log_tcpdump.c:
      Check to make sure we have a pointer before we reference a structure
      element.

2004-08-05 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/log.c:
    * src/detect.c:
      Make tagging work for more than 1 second.  (Daniel Roelker)
    
    * src/detect.c:
    * src/fpdetect.c:
      Get thresholding/suppression to work for alerts that do not
      contain an iph header (primarily decode alerts).  Thanks
      Brian Caswell.

2004-08-04 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/snort.c:
      Fix inline printf's during initialize.  Also fix return code on
      invalid input for startup.  This helps scripts so it returns
      an error if the command line arguments in the script are wrong.
      Thank you Matt Brannigan for this fix.

2004-07-28 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * configure.in:
      Added --include-pcre* configuration option to help cross compiling.
      Thanks Erik de Castro Lopo.

    * src/event_queue.c:
      Fix bug in multi-event logging when thresholding/suppression was enabled
      for events in the queue.  Thanks once again to Andreas Ostling.

    * src/output-plugins/spo_log_tcpdump.c:
      When a rebuilt stream causes an alert, log out the original packets
      instead of the rebuilt packet.  Thanks Marty Roesch.

    * src/preprocessors/HttpInspect/user_interface/hi_ui_config.c:
      Turn off some alerts in the profile that were causing false positives.

    * src/preprocessors/HttpInspect/normalization/hi_norm.c:
      Turn off encoding alerts in HTTP parameter field.  The parameter field
      is still normalized, it just doesn't alert.  This helps reduce alerts
      that are generated from complex parameter queries.

      Added new portscan detector.  We now detect tcp, udp, icmp, and
      ip protocol scans.  Along with the following scan types (using
      nmap terminology): portscan, decoy portscan, portsweep, and
      distributed portscan.  The initial version will have three sensitivity
      levels, so if you want to change values manually go to portscan.c and
      change the values there.  I don't want to confuse people out of the
      gate with lots of value configurations, so try these preset levels
      and give us feedback.  (Daniel Roelker)

      SANS GIAC practical examination.  Thanks for working with us on
      this one.

2004-05-06 Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

      Thanks for pointing it out Marty.  (Roelker)

    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c:
      Fixed null pointer dereference when detect_scans were enabled and

      added new inBounds function to check a ptr position against a
      known start and end location

    * src/mstring.c (mSearch):	 
      subsequent offsets adjusted correctly (Marty)

    * src/preprocessors/spp_rpc_decode.c
      - redefine MSB
      - write fraghdr back into pkt
      - removed extraneous printf

    * src/preprocessors/spp_rpc_decode.c:
       - readded config.h and strings.h (Thanks Chad)

 	 - suspend renabling mode fixes

2003-03-03  Chris Green  <cmg@sourcefire.com>	
    * src/preprocessors/spp_rpc_decode.c (PreprocRpcDecode):
       - alignment errors on non-x86 platforms
       - added new space delimited options
             alert_fragments
             no_alert_multiple_requests
             no_alert_large_fragments
             no_alert_incomplete
       - corrected buffer overflow in fragment normalization

    * src/bitop.h:
    * src/fpcreate.c:
    * src/fpdetect.c:
        - Fixed a problem when snort runs with only uricontent matches
          and no contents.  In this case an element in the bitop structure 
          never got initialized, so it's not good to reference that.
          Problem was caught by Chris Green doing some unit testing.

         Thanks to Chris Green for suggesting we use NSIS!
    
2003-02-19  Chris Reid  <chris.reid@codecraftconsultants.com>
    * src/snort.c
       - Win32 '-s' parameter wasn't configured to accept an optarg,
         but code expected one, causing null-pointer violation.

2003-02-16  Chris Green  <cmg@sourcefire.com>

    * src/preprocessors/spp_http_decode.c (PreprocUrlDecode):
       * remove broken checks.

       * remove broken checks.

2003-02-15  bmc <bmc@snort.org>
    * src/preprocessors/spp_asn1.c
       - don't bother decodeing the packet if its 0 bytes
    * src/preprocessors/spp_fnord.c
       - don't bother decodeing the packet if its 0 bytes
       - set DEBUG to DEBUG_PLUGIN instead of DEBUG_STREAM
    * src/preprocessors/spp_http_decode.c
       - don't bother decodeing the packet if its 0 bytes
       - if stream4 is enabled, only decode if if is client data
         on an established session
         (This makes using internal_alerts useful)

    * src/detection-plugins/sp_byte_jump.c
       actually verify that it needs aligning before aligning.  
       (more than 0 doesn't need aligned)

2003-02-15  bmc <bmc@snort.org>
    * src/detection-plugins/sp_byte_jump.c
       0 is already aligned to a 32-bit boundry...

2003-02-14  bmc <bmc@snort.org>
    * src/mstring.c
       Fix so --enable-debug actually compiles

2003-02-14  mfr <roesch@sourcefire.com>
    * src/parser.c
        Fixed XferHeader() function to copy the not_*p_flag to the RTNs...

      src/detection-plugins/sp_pattern_match.c
        Fixed distance/within/byte_test/byte_jump relative (stateful) 
        pattern matching and the like.  Complete reimplementation of
        payload position tracking.  Tested with several different attack
        scenarios with 100% detection rate, please test!

2003-02-04  Chris Reid  <chris.reid@codecraftconsultants.com>

    * src/snort.c
        Added sanity checks on command-line parameters, for whenever a user
        forgets to put spaces between (ie.) /SERVICE/INSTALL.  This only
        applies to /SERVICE parameter for Win32.

    * src/util.c
      - Updated Win32 banner for version 2.0
      - Modified FatalError to generate a Win32 EventLog entry
        if this is a Win32 Service build, otherwise no errors
        are ever presented to the user.

    * src/mwm.c
      - Added an include of config.h, for Windows build.
      - Changed variable names "small" and "large" into "small_value"
        and "large_value" to prevent compile errors under Visual C++.

    * src/mpse.c
    * src/pcrm.c
      - Added an include of config.h, for Windows build.

    * src/parser/IpAddrSet.c
    * src/preprocessors/perf-flow.c
      - Added ifndef/endif around non-Win32 header files.

    * src/preprocessors/perf-base.c
      - Added changes to allow it to compile under Win32.

    * src/preprocessors/perf.h
      - Prevent definition of UINT64 under Win32.

    * src/preprocessors/spp_asn1.c
    * src/preprocessors/spp_bo.c
    * src/preprocessors/spp_fnord.c
      - Added documentation.

    * src/win32/WIN32-Includes/config.h
      - Added definition for UINT64 and uint64
      - Changed VERSION to '2.0.0beta'

    * src/win32/WIN32-Code/win32_service.c
      - Changed how Win32 registry is opened for reading (was KEY_ALL_ACCESS,
        now is KEY_READ).  Problem (and patch) was reported by Michael Miller.

    * src/win32/WIN32-Prj/snort.dsp
      - Removed all references to SFStats compile options, since these stats
        provide little useful information under Win32 due to API differences
        between Win32 and Unix, specifically the lack of a native getrusage().

    * src/win32/WIN32-Prj/snort.ncb
      src/win32/WIN32-Prj/snort.opt
      src/win32/WIN32-Prj/snort.plg
      - Truncated the contents of these files.

2003-01-26  Chris Green  <cmg@sourcefire.com>

    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c
     (AlertFlushStream):
   	  - Fixed problem where an alert on a stream
        would update sequence numbers incorrenctly	
      - moved StoreStreamPkt up to avoid crash

       Thanks to Lawrence Reed for pointing out problems and almost
       perfect solutions

    * src/detection-plugins/sp_clientserver.c (CheckForReassembled):
       missing return in opt node check
       affects only flow: only_stream

2002-1-17  Daniel Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>
    * src/preprocessors/spp_perfmonitor.c:
        Added 'snortfile' parameter to perfmonitor so users can use the
        default snort directory to log performance statistics.  Suggested
        by L. Reed.

    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c:
        Fixed performance statistic counter for total stream4 sessions.  When
        a new session is created, we make sure that it was created before
        incrementing the counter.  Fixed by L. Reed.

2003-01-07  mfr <roesch@sourcefire.com>
    * configure.in
        Added patch from Jeff Nathan to fix libnet detection

2003-01-05  mfr <roesch@sourcefire.com>
    * src/util.h
        Added self preservation control struct for the new SPAlloc function.

    * src/util.c
        Added self preservation-aware memory allocator, this allows coders
        to add new subsystems requiring self preservation techniques using
        a single allocation interface and management mechanism.

    * src/detection-plugins
        Changed the URI and AND checking modules to use the context pointer
        on the fp_list struct instead of the ds_list.  This will cause
        all content/uricontent checks to be checked in the sequence that
        they appear in a rule so that all the distance/within and 
        relative byte_test/byte_jump stuff will work properly.  Merry Xmas
        cazz!

    * src/preprocessors/spp_frag2.c
        Changed frag2 to use the new SPAlloc mechanism as a testing
        platform.  If this works right I'll convert all the other stuff
        over to it as well.

2002-12-13  Chris Green  <cmg@sourcefire.com>

    * src/preprocessors/spp_frag2.c (Frag2Defrag):
       - added "state_protection" config mechanism to enable/disable
         the thresholding operations	

    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c:
       - mark sessions that have been picked up midstream
           - protect against people setting up snort behind a tap without
         setting asynchronous link
       - added "state_protection" config mechanism to enable/disable
         the thresholding operations

    * src/decode.h (SSNFLAG_MIDSTREAM): added a midstream pickup flag

2002-12-12  Daniel J. Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>

    * src/fpcreate.c:
    * src/fpdetect.c:
        Fixed bi-directional rule functionality when unique port was the

    * src/checksum.h:  
        Problem with ICMP checksum.  Routine did not return the compliment
        of the checksum.  Thanks to Del Armstrong for point this out.

    * src/decode.c:
        Also, UDP checksums are only done if the checksum is 0.  Otherwise,
        we don't do them, even if the config is set for that.  Again,
        thanks to Del Armstrong for pointing this out.

2002-11-26  Chris Green  <cmg@sourcefire.com>

    * src/output-plugins/spo_database.c (BeginTransaction):

            suspend_period: <duration of suspended operations>

           	added Emergency / Suspend mode

    * src/generators.h: added Emergency / Suspend alerts to

       stream4/frag2 - in the future, these should not generate packet
       log alerts but they are required to for the current view of the
       world

    * src/detect.h (DisableDetect): added function
    

2002-11-16  Chris Green  <cmg@sourcefire.com>

2002-11-06  Daniel J. Roelker <droelker@sourcefire.com>
    * src/mwm.c:
    * src/mwm.h:
        Fixed another bug in mwm search routines when dealing with identical
        one byte patterns in multiple rules.  There was a theoretical 
        possibility of overwriting a one byte rule group (example: "~") with
        another rule group of ("|00 7e|").  This has now been fixed and 
        should be the last of the one byte pattern problems.

    * src/plugbase.c:
    * src/detection_plugins/sp_byte_jump.c:
    * src/detection_plugins/sp_byte_jump.h:
      Added byte_jump, we can now decode a length from the app layer and jump
      the detect_offset_end (last match pointer) up that number of bytes, 
      great for decoding RPC with Snort rules

2002-11-04  mfr <roesch@sourcefire.com>
    * src/detect.c:
    * src/fpdetect.c:
      fixed case where multiple rules can have partial matches on content and
      fuxor the detect_offset_end calculations (i.e. reset the offset for 
      every OTN in the system)

       and server traffic.  Useful for HTTP performance.

    * src/preprocessors/spp_perfmonitor.*, src/preprocessors/perf*.*:
      Added a performance monitor that keeps stats on snort.  Some of
      those stats are Mbits/sec, Alerts/sec, TCP state information,
      network traffic flows and percentages, etc.
    
    * src/preprocessors/sfprocpidstats.c:
      Added functionality for multiple CPU stats on linux.  For use in
      spp_perfmonitor, etc.

    * src/preprocessors/spp_http_decode.c:
           moved setting the uri_count to this preprocessor to handle false
    	   alerts on reassembled packets.


2002-09-17  Roman Danyliw <roman@danyliw.com>
    * src/output-plugin/spo_database.c
         - make sure that a packet payload larger than those supported
           in the SQL INSERT are properly terminated.

2002-09-12  Roman Danyliw <roman@danyliw.com>

    * src/output-plugin/spo_database.c
         - made the updating of the sensor.last_cid more efficient by
           only storing the new cid value at shutdown
         - removed extranous CR/LF from sensor name

2002-09-05  Chris Green  <cmg@sourcefire.com>

    * src/log.c (PrintICMPHeader): off by one error in printing
          Thanks to Dave Goldsmith

2002-09-05  Roman Danyliw <roman@danyliw.com>

       * src/output-plugin/spo_database.c: (DatabaseInit)
         - added ignore_bpf configuration option (from Michael Boman)

         ignore_bpf - Do we want to create a new sensor definition everytime
                the BPF filter is changed? The options are:

                [no|0]: (default) Create a new sensor definition if BPF
                        filter has been modified

                [yes|1]: Ignore the BPF part when looking for the server
                         definition

2002-09-03  Roman Danyliw <roman@danyliw.com>

       * src/output-plugin/spo_database.c

         - DB schema v106
         - Added the sensor.last_cid field to the schema so the
           database can store the last used cid for a given sensor.
           This field will ensure that a cid will never be reused.

           Upgrading from v105 -> v106 is as simple as:

           mysql> ALTER TABLE sensor ADD last_cid INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL;
           mysql> UPDATE schema SET vseq=106;

            psql> ALTER TABLE sensor ADD last_cid INT8;
            psql> UPDATE schema SET vseq=106;
          
         - Improved error messages

        (now with port lists!)

    * src/detection-plugins/sp_pattern_match.c (PayloadSearchRawbytes):
      new pattern match option!

      rawbytes -- used to inspect the raw packet data instead of the
      alternatively decode application packet buffer	

    * src/decode.h (DECODE_BLEN): my favorite constant typo.

    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c (Stream4InitReassembler):
      turning off server side reassembly by default ( was what the
      default said it was )

    * src/detection-plugins/sp_tcp_flag_check.c (ParseTCPFlags):
      adding mask bits to the flag checks
          (limitation pointed out by Dirk Mueller)

      example: flags: S,12

      ECN bits.  tcp_flags & (0xFF ^ tcp_mask); for those of you that
      like to think in C

    * src/detection-plugins/sp_pattern_match.c (Check{AND|OR}PatternMatch):
      - normalization of telnet stuff into a separate buffer

    * src/preprocessors/spp_telnet_negotiation.c (SetupTelNeg):
      - only allow this to be called telnet_decode

        odder flag combinations	    
      - ttl_limit will only alert if the packet ttl is less than 10

    (TcpAction*):
  	  - removed stream_pkt->packet_flag sets new ( makes
        no sense because we overwrite the packet_flags in BuildPacket
        ( pointed out by arron walters -- ended up
          being the source of a few other bugs )


2002-07-30  Chris Green  <cmg@sourcefire.com>

    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c (BuildPacket):

2002-04-25  Chris Green  <cmg@sourcefire.com>

    * Introduced IP_VER, IP_HLEN, SET_IP_VER, SET_IP_HLEN after
    thinking about tcpdump and what Fyodor had talked to me about
    months ago regarding cross platform compatiblity.  No more
    twiddling.

    Plugins that use ip_ver, ip_hlen should be tested.  No more bit
    packed notation allowed in the source tree.

    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c:
       separated evasion alerts from retransmission/state

       evasion alerts default to being on now

       disable with disable_evasion_alerts

2002-04-24  Chris Green  <cmg@sourcefire.com>

    * src/preprocessors/spp_frag2.c (Frag2Init):
      fixex argument parsing

    * src/preprocessors/spp_http_decode.c:
      don't process fragments

    * src/preprocessors/spp_frag2.c
    (InsertFrag):
      make sure that we don't run out of memory if someone sends us the
      	  same fragment over and over again

      duplicate first frag is a special case

2002-04-23  Chris Green  <cmg@sourcefire.com>

    * src/preprocessors/spp_frag2.c
      (InsertFrag):
    - adding detection of attack where we would start
      reassembling packet fully before the full fragtracker is there

    * src/detect.c (EvalPacket):
      - fixed alert ip rules
         (got clobbered when playing detection engine optimizations )

      - generate proper events when decode errors happen

    * src/plugbase.c (InitPlugIns): SetupFragOffset()

    * src/detection-plugins/sp_ip_fragbits.c:
      - added fragoffset:

        fragoffset: [!<>] <integer>

        defined in fragbits so that I can backport it.

    * src/preprocessors/spp_frag2.c (InsertFrag):
    -  alert on frag2 overlaps

        To do this requires keeping the packets around for a while
        longer to detect all the multiple fragments and overlaps

        Changed the PruneCache to notice when things are completed and
        prune them in addition to just by time. Frag mem faults are
        going to increase because of this but each time one occurs,
        there should be plenty to expire.

    * src/preprocessors/spp_stream4.c
 	(TraverseFunc):
 	  - added next seq check on reassembly
 	  - added alerts on retransmitted sequences...
 	              its ugly as sin right now
        (_Stream):
 	  - next_seq added
 
 	(StoreStreamPkt):
 	  - added check for restranmitting too fast w/ a different data size
 	  - added tcp checksum retransmission checking
 	    (how much do I need to worry about
 	     data with the same checksum and different payloads...
 	     just throw it away for the moment)

2002-04-05  Martin Roesch <roesch@sourcefire.com>
    * detection engine now walks RTN and OTN lists iteratively instead of
                    recursively, I guess we should cowtow to the x86 crowd...

    * RTNs are now sorted by destination port number allowing for earlier exit
    from the detection engine in the average case and improving performance

    * destination port is now the first thing checked when an RTN is processed
    (for UDP/TCP traffic)

    * New HTTP decoder preprocessor defeats evasive web scans (whisker.pl)
    * detection engine has been heavily modified to implement the new 
      "linked-list-of-function-pointers" concept, which makes the detection
      engine more efficient, more flexible, and faster!

      an IP defragmentation preprocessor!
    * post-decode call function call sequence has been modified to go into 
      the preprocessor system instead of the detection engine

1999-10-18  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>
    * snort.c: * added session dump command line switch

    * log.c: * added sesion data logging functionsi: OpenSessionFile(),
           DumpSessionData().
    
    * decode.c: * fixes snaplen issues with reading back tcpdump files.


1999-10-13  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>
    * snort.c: * threw out tcpdump file readback code and implemented
             open_pcap_offline solution.  Has addded benefit of 
             allowing BPF filters to be used to modify file readback
             streams.  
           * Fixed MTU snafu.

    * decode.c: * Rewrote ARP decoder.  The decoder is much simpler (but 
              the log routines are far more complex)
            * Horsed around with the TCP and IP option decoders.  I 
              think they work better now...

             for buffer overflows

           * Removed range checking for the ICMP icode and itype
             option keywords so that DoS attacks and covert activity 
             could be more easily filtered/monitored

1999-09-26  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>
    * snort.c: * new command line options -A, -F, -N, -p, -b

           * new option keywords: dsize, offset, depth
           * cleaned up crappy logic around the logging functions with
             nice clean function pointers (aaaahhhh....)
           * added bidirectional rules functionality (now Snort goes
             both ways....)

    * log.c: * broke out alerting function into seperate subfunctions
         * ditto logging functions
         * fixed string termination code in the SMB alerter so that it
           can now alert to more than one box at a time
         * cleaned up syslog messages
         * finally fixed the SMB "alert once" problem (kudos to Gandalf
           Schaufelberger for that one)

1999-08-06  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>
    * log.c: * added code to AlertMsg to make sure that there was in fact
           an alert message to print out

    * libraries: * fixed the backdoor and scan libraries so they should 
               flase alarm less often

1999-08-05  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>
    * snort.c: * activated CyberPsychotic's daemon mode code (use the 
             -D switch for daemon mode
           * default logging directory changed from "." to 
             /var/log/snort
                   * sanity checks performed on the default log dir now

    * decode.c: * changed the truncated Ethernet header notification to
              only go off in verbose mode
            * removed cruft

    * rules.c: * Added Ron Snyder's "address negation" patch.  Rules may
             now contain "!" on the IP addresses to indicate anything
             BUT the given address

    * log.c: * added support for the new default logging directory

    * configure.in: * fixed some more sparc configuration problems

    * other: * CyberPsychotic sent a new ftp buffer overflow rule in

1999-08-04  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>
    * snort.c: * fixed some DEBUG statements
           * enabled the daemon mode code (this is still 
             experimental)
    * decode.c: * fixed various and sundry DEBUG code
            * fixed the TCP option decoder so it wouldn't overflow
              its prinout buffer and cleaned up the temp buffer
    * rules.c: * fixed some DEBUG code
           
    * log.c: * fixed a buffer copy problem with the daemon mode alert
           logging 
         * fixed the SMB alerting code and the standard log output 
           when in SMB alerting mode
         * cleaned up some of the fragment logging code
         * fixed the logto rules option coding to work properly
    * configure.in: * fixed a whole bunch of little problems that are
              screwing up big endian/non-PC machines.  This
              version should work and compile much more cleanly
               on all architectures!

    * other: fixed a bad rule in the RULES.SAMPLE file and another bad
         one in the misc-lib file

1999-08-01  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>
    * rules.c: Wrote brand new detection engine.  The new engine uses
               a 2-dimensional linked list with recursive node walking.
               Rules are grouped by address/port commonality and then
               option chains are linked to common head blocks.  This
               reduces the number of tests required to find a specific
               test to perform, and reduces the total number of tests
               performed on a given packet in all cases by 200-500%
               over version 1.1.

    * decode.c: Rewrote the packet decode engine.  The new engine 
            performs far fewer copies and tries to set pointers
            to defer expensive function calls as late as possible.
            The PrintIP and Net data structures have been eliminated
            so that there is no global data required to perform tests
            or log a given packet.  This will make any future multi-
            threading efforts much easier. 

    * log.c: * Much of the logging system was rewritten to take advantage 
               of the new detection and decoding engines.
        
         * Made the SMB alerting a configure-time option.  If you 
           want to use the SMB alerting feature, you need to specify
           a "--enable-smbalerts" when you run configure.  This is a 
           safety measure, read the INSTALL file for the reasons why!

    * snort.c: Fixed a bug in the netmask generation code that wouldn't
           allow certain CIDR blocks to be represented.  Thanks to 
           Nick Rogness <nick@trinux.rapidnet.com> for the heads
           up on this one!

1999-06-21  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>
    
    * snort.c: * Added new command line switches: -f, -M, -r.  
               -f: Record fragmented packets in tcpdump format
               -M: Send alerts via WinPopup messages (requires Samba)
               -r: Read and process files generated by tcpdump 

           * Fixed startup dumpout code to not drop people if they just
             want to log all packets to the system

           * Added static netmask generation, this rids Snort of the
             need to link to libm, which makes it more Trinux friendly.

    * rules.c: * Added new rule option types:
              logto: log packets matching this rule to the specified
                             log file
              minfrag: set the minimum size of fragmented packets, which
                   allows alerts to be generated for traffic coming
                   from things like nmap or fragrouter
              tcp flags: Added the ability to include the reserved bits
                     of the tcp flags into the rules set.  These
                     flags are specified with a "1" and "2.  
                     Inclusion of these flags allows Queso 
                                 fingerprinting attempts to be detected.
              id: The IP ID field may be specified.  This is nice for 
              picking up handcrafted packets with recognizable ID
              fields, like 31337 or other "elite" numbers.
              ack: The TCP ack field.  Using this, nmap tcp "pings" may
               be detected.
              seq: The TCP sequence number.  This is provided for 
               completeness (I figured since I was putting in the 
               ack field, I may as well include the sequence as 
               well)
           * Rewrote the content parser.  It now accepts "\" as a 
             literal character, so things like "\|" or "\~" will work
             properly.

           * fixed the parenthesis finder for the options code

           * adjusted the acceptable character range in the rule
             parsers

    * log.c: * fragment logging more descriptive and correct

         * fixed IP header logging for ICMP and fragmented packets

         * improved "bad packet" printing/logging

         * fixed IP option output code

         * IP packet ID field now displayed

    * decode.c: * fixed IP fragment decoders and logic streams.

            * fragments are now fed thru the rules set (sorta)

1999-05-17  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>

    * snort.c: Added "-x" command line switch to explicitly activate IPX
           packet notification so people in mixed protocol environments
                   can maintain sanity.  Also added in the new packet counter to
           generate statistics on exit of the number/percentage of 
           each type of packet that Snort sees.

    * decode.h: Removed the references to u_int16_t and u_int32_t and 
            replaced them with u_short and u_long.  The u_int*_t 
            variables caused portability headaches.  Also added in the 
            new patch from Chris S. for the  WORDS_MUSTALIGN definition
            for S/Linux version.

    * log.h: Fixed the LOG_AUTH/LOG_AUTHPRIV problem that Solaris users 
         were having.

    * decode.c: Added the new packet statistics counters throughout the 
            code.  Cleaned up the IPX code a bit.  

    * rules.c: Cleaned up the isspace(3) (et al) calls.

    * etc: Made lots of tweaks to the autoconf stuff to get the S/Linux
           and HP-UX versions to compile cleanly out of the box.

1999-04-28  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>

    * rules.c: Added the code to change the order the rules are applied in.

    * snort.c: Added two new command line switches: "-o" and "-s".

    * decode.c: Added in new layer 2 decoding for SLIP and RAW packet 
                types.

        * log.c: Added code to send alert notification to syslog.

1999-04-17  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>

    * rules.c: Rewrote the rules option parser.  It's now a much more
                   consistant interface for both reading rules into the program
                   and writing them as a user.  Added in new rule types to 
                   alert on TTL values, and ICMP types/codes.

    * log.c: Most of the logging code has been dramatically rewritten as 
                 well, and it now works much better. 

    * mstring.c: Added the notion of a meta character to mSplit() so that
                     it was possible to not split on every single occurence of
                     a character in a string.

    * decode.c: Smoothed out all the logging system calls to work nicely
                    with the new log code.

1999-04-08  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>

    * rules.c: Moved AlertPkt() and LogPkt() to log.c

    * log.c: Totally revamped the logging code to be more logical and 
                 have less duplication in the code.  There are now seperate 
                 logging functions for each of the layers of the packet.  
                 PrintIPPkt() has been totally rewritten, PrintFragHeader has
                 been eliminated, and two functions have been moved over from
                 rules.c and completely rewritten as well.

    * decode.c: Reworked the routines which called the logging functions.

1999-04-06  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>

    * decode.c: added code to display/log the Fragment ID field of the IP
                    header.  Got a nice patch from Sebastian to add in TOS 
                    decoding as well.  Added ethernet header logging and 
                    display code.

    * mstring.c: fixed the match() routine.  It had a tendency to miss some
                     things some of the time.  (oops!)  Content based matching
                     should work all the time now.

    * log.c: added code to display some of the new stuff that's decoded.

    * snort.c: add a new command line switch: "-e".  This will display the 
                   ethernet header data in both the log files and on the screen.

1999-03-24  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>
        
        * decode.c: fixed the damned TCP and IP options decoders.  These things
                    were a friggin pain in the ass to program up properly.
                    Recoding them stopped the huge loop that they had a bad
                    tendancy to get stuck in, thereby making the rest of the 
                    program nigh infinitely more useful for just about any
                    friggin problem under the friggin sun.  Frig it.

    * log.c: Stopped the insanity of unnessary carriage returns in the log
                 files and on screen printouts.  Another PITA.

        * rules.c: Fixed output formatting yet again.


1999-03-21  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>

    * snort.c: fixed a bug in the timestamp code so the month prints out
                   right

    * decode.c: added code to detect and decode IP and TCP Options.  Also
                 added code to print packet fragments with truncated headers
                 into a PACKET_FRAG file which gets dumped in the default log
                 directory.

    * log.c: added code and data structures to print out IP and TCP Options
                 plus I fixed the f'd up fragment print out logic.  Changed
                 OpenLogFile() to include a mode argument for packet fragment
                 print out.

    * rules.c: rewired the entire rules test routine and added some long
                   needed goto's into the program.  I feel manly now.  Also
                   added a new rule field: TCP flags.  This allows us to 
                   alert/log/pass on tcp flags.  Also added in port range 
                   functionality, you can now specify a range of ports, or 
                   greater than/less than a specified port.
 

1999-03-08  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>

    * snort.c: Ripped off the timestamp printout routines from tcpdump
           and stuffed them into snort.c, yum yum.  This gives us
           millisecond timestamping on the packets for those of you
           interested in such things.


1999-03-06  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>

    * mstring.c: mContainsSubstring has been replaced.  mContainsSubstring 
             is a brute force pattern matcher, and is therefore very
             slow and not too efficient.  The new routine, match(), 
             implements a Boyer-Moore string search algorithm and is 
             much faster in the general case and much more tolerent of
             "poor" pattern selection.

    * log.c: PrintNetData has been completely rewritten.  It should now be
                 much faster and only needs to generate the print out buffer
                 once per packet.  This routine was a major source of slow 
                 down/dropped packets before.  You still shouldn't use verbose 
                 mode with the "-d" command line switch if you're using Snort 
                 as an IDS, because it's still slow enough to drop some large
                 packets.  Packet print out has changed as well, with the 
                 different packet layers seperated by onto their own lines
                 (well, mostly).  Fragmented packets are now recorded in a 
                 "FRAG" file.

    * decode.c: Snort now detects fragmented packets, plus the DF and MF 
                    bits, and decodes the fragment offset.  
     
    * snort.c: Now displays packet collected/dropped statistics when 
                   shutting down.


1999-02-18  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>

    * snort.c: Code cleanup and some error checking was added.  The system
           now accepts the interface name you give it at the command
           line.  Fixed a problem with underallocating the interface
           name buffer for names specified on the command line.  
           Suprisingly, this only came to light when tested on the 
             Sparc architecture.

    * log.c: ICMP logging now includes the ICMP code description in the 
         filename.  This makes it easier to see what you're interested
         in without having to go digging into the log files.

    * decode.c: Made the ICMP types and codes a little more compatible with
            being used as a filename.


1999-01-28  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>

        * rules.c: Rules sorting is now implemented.  There are actually three
                   seperate lists (Pass, Log, Alert) now, with the rules being
                   placed on to the lists in the order they're read from the 
                   rules file.  The rule execution order was changed, now
                   Alert rules are applied first, then Pass Rules, the Log 
                   rules.  Content based rules are available now, the actual
                   application layer data can be searched, both binary and 
                   text, for a specific pattern to activate a rule on.

        * decode.c: Minor changes to reflect the new rules structure.


1999-01-19  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>

        * snort.c: Modularized the code, big time!  New source modules are log,
                   rules, decode, and mstring.  Dumped SetFlow() for now.

        * rules.c: Rules based packet logging now enabled!

        * log.c: Now keeps track of TCP/UDP conversations better!

        * decode.c: Enhanced decoding of packets, including ICMP ECHO seq and
                    id!
 

1999-01-08  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>

        * snort.c: Made a fix to SetFlow() so that it wouldn't dump the
                   program if it got traffic from 0.0.0.0 or 255.255.255.255.

        * snort.h: Removed the "#define VERSION" since it's handled in config.h.

        * README: Proper README file included with this distro


1998-12-21  mfr  <roesch@clark.net>
    * snort.c: Made this file, figured out autoconf
