 *              - printf, scanf (outside the measurement loop)
 *              In addition, Berkeley UNIX system calls "times ()" or "time ()"
 *              are used for execution time measurement. For measurements
 *              on other systems, these calls have to be changed.

 * Defines:     The following "Defines" are possible:
 *      -DREG          (default: Not defined)
 *              As an approximation to what an average C programmer
 *              might do, causes the "register" storage class to be applied
 *              - for local variables, if they are used (dynamically)
 *                five or more times
 *              - for parameters if they are used (dynamically)
 *                six or more times
 *              Note that an optimal "register" strategy is
 *              compiler-dependent, and that "register" declarations
 *              do not necessarily lead to faster execution.
 *      -DNOSTRUCTASSIGN        (default: Not defined)
 *              Define if the C compiler does not support
 *              assignment of structures.
 *      -DNOENUMS               (default: Not defined)
 *              Define if the C compiler does not support
 *              enumeration types.
 *      -DTIMES                 (default)
 *      -DTIME
 *              The "times" function of UNIX (returning process times)
 *              or the "time" function (returning wallclock time)
 *              is used for measurement. 
 *              For single user machines, "time ()" is adequate. For
 *              multi-user machines where you cannot get single-user
 *              access, use the "times ()" function. If you have
 *              neither, use a stopwatch in the dead of night.
 *              "printf"s are provided marking the points "Start Timer"
 *              and "Stop Timer". DO NOT use the UNIX "time(1)"
 *              command, as this will measure the total time to
 *              run this program, which will (erroneously) include
 *              the time to allocate storage (malloc) and to perform
 *              the initialization.
 *      -DHZ=nnn
 *              In Berkeley UNIX, the function "times" returns process
 *              time in 1/HZ seconds, with HZ = 60 for most systems.
 *              CHECK YOUR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU JUST APPLY
 *              A VALUE.
 *
 ***************************************************************************
 *
 *  History:	Version C/2.1 was made for two reasons:
 *
 *	1) There was an obvious need for a common C version of
 *      Dhrystone, since C is at present the most popular system
 *      programming language for the class of processors
 *      (microcomputers, minicomputers) where Dhrystone is used most.
 *      There should be, as far as possible, only one C version of
 *      Dhrystone such that results can be compared without
 *      restrictions. In the past, the C versions distributed
 *      by Rick Richardson (Version 1.1) and by Reinhold Weicker
 *      had small (though not significant) differences.
 *
 *      2) As far as it is possible without changes to the Dhrystone
 *      statistics, optimizing compilers should be prevented from
 *      removing significant statements.
 *
 *      This C version has been developed in cooperation with
 *      Rick Richardson (Tinton Falls, NJ), it incorporates many
 *      ideas from the "Version 1.1" distributed previously by
 *      him over the UNIX network Usenet.
 *      I also thank Chaim Benedelac (National Semiconductor),
 *      David Ditzel (SUN), Earl Killian and John Mashey (MIPS),
 *      Alan Smith and Rafael Saavedra-Barrera (UC at Berkeley)
 *      for their help with comments on earlier versions of the
 *      benchmark.
 *
 *  Changes:    In the initialization part, this version follows mostly
 *      Rick Richardson's version distributed via Usenet, not the
 *      version distributed earlier via floppy disk by Reinhold Weicker.
 *      As a concession to older compilers, names have been made
 *      unique within the first 8 characters.
 *      Inside the measurement loop, this version follows the
 *      version previously distributed by Reinhold Weicker.
 *
 *      At several places in the benchmark, code has been added,
 *      but within the measurement loop only in branches that 
 *      are not executed. The intention is that optimizing compilers
 *      should be prevented from moving code out of the measurement
 *      loop, or from removing code altogether. Since the statements
 *      that are executed within the measurement loop have NOT been
 *      changed, the numbers defining the "Dhrystone distribution"
 *      (distribution of statements, operand types and locality)
 *      still hold. Except for sophisticated optimizing compilers,
 *      execution times for this version should be the same as
 *      for previous versions.
 *
 *      Since it has proven difficult to subtract the time for the
 *      measurement loop overhead in a correct way, the loop check
 *      has been made a part of the benchmark. This does have
 *      an impact - though a very minor one - on the distribution
 *      statistics which have been updated for this version.
 *
 *      All changes within the measurement loop are described
 *      and discussed in the companion paper "Rationale for
 *      Dhrystone version 2".
 *
 *      Because of the self-imposed limitation that the order and
 *      distribution of the executed statements should not be
 *      changed, there are still cases where optimizing compilers
 *      may not generate code for some statements. To a certain
 *      degree, this is unavoidable for small synthetic benchmarks.
 *      Users of the benchmark are advised to check code listings
 *      whether code is generated for all statements of Dhrystone.
 *
 *      Version 2.1 is identical to version 2.0 distributed via
 *      the UNIX network Usenet in March 1988 except that it corrects
 *      some minor deficiencies that were found by users of version 2.0.
 *      The only change within the measurement loop is that a
 *      non-executed "else" part was added to the "if" statement in
 *      Func_3, and a non-executed "else" part removed from Proc_3.
 *
 * Version C/2.2, Steven Pemberton, October 1993
 *	Functionally, identical to version 2.2; the changes are in
 *	how you compile and use it:
 *	- Everything is in one file now, but compiled in 2 passes
 *	- Compile (and run) by running the file through the shell: 'sh dhry.c"
 *	- Uses the system definition of HZ if one can be found
 *	- HZ must be defined, otherwise it won't compile (no defaults here)
 *	- The (uninteresting) output is printed to stderr (dhry2 > /dev/null)
 *	- The number of loops is passed as a parameter, rather than read
 *	  (dhry2 500000)
 *	- If the number of loops is insufficient to get a good result,
 *	  it repeats it with loops*10 until it is enough (rather than just
 *	  stopping)
 *	- Output says which sort of clock it is using, and the HZ value
 *	- You can use -DREG instead of the -DREG=register of previous versions
 *	- Some stylistic cleanups.
 *		
 ***************************************************************************
 *
 *  Compilation model and measurement (IMPORTANT):
 *
 *  The following "ground rules" apply for measurements:
 *  - Separate compilation
 *  - No procedure merging
 *  - Otherwise, compiler optimizations are allowed but should be indicated
 *  - Default results are those without register declarations
 *  See the companion paper "Rationale for Dhrystone Version 2" for a more
 *  detailed discussion of these ground rules.
 *
 *  For 16-Bit processors (e.g. 80186, 80286), times for all compilation
 *  models ("small", "medium", "large" etc.) should be given if possible,
 *  together with a definition of these models for the compiler system used.

 *  Dhrystone (C version) statistics:
 *
 *  [Comment from the first distribution, updated for version 2.
 *   Note that because of language differences, the numbers are slightly
 *   different from the Ada version.]
 *
 *  The following program contains statements of a high level programming
 *  language (here: C) in a distribution considered representative:           
 *
 *    assignments                  52 (51.0 %)
 *    control statements           33 (32.4 %)
 *    procedure, function calls    17 (16.7 %)
 *
 *  103 statements are dynamically executed. The program is balanced with
 *  respect to the three aspects:                                             
 *
 *    - statement type
 *    - operand type

 *         operand global, local, parameter, or constant.                     
 *
 *  The combination of these three aspects is balanced only approximately.

 *  cache, or to balance the use of long or short displacements for code or
 *  data.
