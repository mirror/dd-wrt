  the active driver.</para><para>If it is, test if the driver has a
  configurator function and is able to be reconfigured. A good result
  here will call the driver event hook with type 'driver_switch', and
  return a 0.</para><para>For an entry with a different driver name,
  scan all available drivers to see if the wanted one is there. An
  unmatched name exits, returning 0.</para><para>If we got a match,
  get the baudrate for the device with
  <function>gpsd_assert_sync()</function>, probe for the subtype if we
  have one.</para><para>If the device has a configurator and is
  reconfigurable, trigger the configurator.</para><para>Return a 1 to

  still hanging in there, we now see if we already have had more than
  4 good fixes, otherwise we can't trust the 1PPS.</para><para>We then
