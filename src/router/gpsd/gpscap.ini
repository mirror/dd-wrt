#
# type	       = "engine", "vendor", or "device"
# date         = date of submission
# submitter    = email of submitter, name may need quoting for RFC822
# description  = Human-readable description of this item
# packaging    = A device's form factor
# techdoc      = URL to technical documentation, or at least a spec sheet
# vendor_site  = URL of a vendor site
# vendor       = vendor name
# eval_unit    = Which GPSD devs have one for testing (list)
# engine       = GPS chipset (may reference another section)
# subtype      = engine subtype or firmware revision level
# interfaces   = interface types: USB, RS-232, Bluetooth, CF, TTL, CAN. 
#                May be a list.
# usbchip      = USB I/O chipset
# pps	       = supports pulse-per-second precision time reporting
# pps_accuracy = claimed PPS accracy
# ntp_offset   = NTP offset
# configurable = can the device be bricked by speed changes?
# tested       = last gpsd tested, or "regression" if we have a test load
# nmea	       = NMEA version this emits, if known
# notes	       = Miscellaneous notes on this item.  To be interpreted as HTML
# rating       = excellent, good, fair, poor, broken, other

#
# Capability strings:
#
# to_nmea     = if present, how to switch to NMEA 0183 mode from native binary
# to_native   = if present, how to swith to native binary mode from NMEA
# modeset     = set protocol, baud rate, 8N1
#
# Inheritance
#
# To inherit capabilities from a specified section, name the section in
# a "uses =" attribute. Use chains are followed recursively.  An attribute
# in a section overrides all attributes of the same name in all ancestor
# sections.
#
# Certain escapes in capability strings are translated:
#
# %b	- baud rate as ASCII numeral
#
# A string beginning with 0x is interpreted as a sequence of paired hex bytes,
# leading 0x not included.
#
# Comment lines led with "#%" are vendor section marks to be used when
# generating an HTML table from this file.  Each should consist of a vendor
# name.
#
# Further notes:
# * In the packaging feld, a "GPS mouse" is a standalone sensor in a
#   display-less case designed be used as an outbard peripheral.  An
#   "OEM module" is an un-cased circuit board with edge connectors; a
#   "chipset" is what it sounds like.
#   A "handset" is a standalone GPS with a display and human-usable
#   controls. A "handsfree" is a hands-free unit with display designed for 
#   mounting on a car windshield or boat dash.
# * In the rating field:
#    "excellent" - gpsd recognizes the GPS rapidly and reliably,
#		  reports are complete and correct.
#    "good" -- gpsd has minor problems or lag recognizing the device,
#	      but reports are complete and correct.
#    "fair" -- Reports have minor dropouts or problems, including occasional
#	      transient nonsense values.
#    "poor" -- Reports frequently have values that are wrong or nonsense.
#    "broken" -- gpsd frequently fails to recognize the device at all.
#    "other -- See Technical Notes.

description = Version 1 of the SiRF GPS engine
engine = SiRF-1
nmea = 2.2
uses = GenericSiRF
tested = 2.34
rating = good
logs = uBlox-sirf1.log
notes = uBlox-sirf1.log was made from a device with uBlox firmware and 
      may not be typical of SirF-1 chips.

[SiRF-2]
type = engine
description = Version 2 of the SiRF GPS engine
engine = SiRF-2
# Later versions may do 2.3
nmea = 2.2

     pharos-360.log, tn200-all.log, tn200.log, tn204.log
notes = The bu* logs are in native binary format; the Haicom, Holux, Pharos, 
      and TripNav logs in NMEA. NMEA starts with GGA and ends with RMC. The
      tn204 NMEA looks remarkably like older Garmin cruft and may be emulating 
      one, including the split reporting cycle.

notes = The Blumax log is in NMEA mode.  Start of cycle is GGA, End of cycle 
      is RMC. Some variants (like the Blumax) emit ZDA before GGA; others 
      (like the GPSlim 1236, Motorola T805, RGM3800) do not.

      technical-documentation link describes the 3329, but we think the 3301
      is compatible for GPSD purposes.

submitter = Reported by Ian Darwin <ian@darwinsys.com>
notes = This receiver operates as a generic NMEA device, the Sony
      binary protocol is unsupported. The receiver seems to lock up if
      too much data is thrown at it (ie. gpsd probes) thus it may
      require a read-only (-b) instance of gpsd. (We say 'may' because
      more recent instances of gpsd break the probe writes into pieces
      interleaved with read, and may no longer trigger this problem)

notes = Device has two variants; the basic receiver is 'R' and the 
      version with additional data-logger capability is N.  Emits only NMEA.
      Some Web sources incorrectly describe it as SiRF-3-based.
