Changes in version 1.29.1:

The new option '--bad-sector-data=<file>' has been added. It makes ddrescue
treat as a read error any sector containing the same data as <file>. This is
useful when the drive, instead of signaling a read error, returns known
garbage data (different for each drive model). If you need to use this
option, it means that the failing drive lacks adequate integrity checking.
(Suggested by Eliyahu Saks).

It has been documented in the manual the way of extending outfile to the
size of the partition when using option '--domain-mapfile'.
