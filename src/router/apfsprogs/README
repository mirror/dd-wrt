Apfsprogs is a suite of userland software to work with the Apple File System
on Linux. It's intended mainly to help test the Linux kernel module that can
be retrieved from <git://github.com/eafer/linux-apfs-rw.git>. The following
are included:

  o mkapfs: an experimental filesystem build tool
  o apfs-snap: a tool to take snapshots of a volume mounted with our module
  o apfs-label: a tool to list the labels of all volumes in a container
  o apfsck: a filesystem integrity checker, for now only useful for testers

Usage
=====

To build any of the tools, just cd to its directory and run

  make

The resulting executable will have the name of the tool, and a man page is
available under the same directory. If you run

  make install

the files will be copied to the typical locations in the user home folder: the
binary is placed in ~/bin, and the man page in ~/share/man/man8. You can
override those paths by setting the BINDIR and MANDIR variables, for example:

  make install BINDIR=/sbin MANDIR=/usr/share/man/man8/
