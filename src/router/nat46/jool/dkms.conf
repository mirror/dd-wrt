# dkms.conf: Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) configuration file for Jool.
#
# The use of DKMS ensures that the Jool kernel modules will be rebuilt
# whenever the kernel is upgraded.
#
# Installation instructions:
#   root@host:~# dkms install /path/to/Jool
#
# You should normally not need to edit any of the lines in this file. The
# meanings of the various directives below are documented in DKMS(8).

# DKMS is quite finicky about the contents of the $PACKAGE_VERSION string. It
# will source dkms.conf every time it performs a task, but if the contents
# $PACKAGE_VERSION changes between runs, it fails to work correctly. Since we
# might dynamically generate the version string (based on output from
# "git describe" or "date"), we make sure to generate it only once and save
# the result in a cache file so it can be re-used later.

# Determine where the actual source tree we're working on is located.
# $BASH_SOURCE holds the full path to dkms.conf, which resides in the
# apex of Jool's source tree. So we just have to strip off "/dkms.conf".
