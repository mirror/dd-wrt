/**
 * @name Control channel negotiation states
 *
 * These states represent the different phases of control channel
 * negotiation between OpenVPN peers.  OpenVPN servers and clients
 * progress through the states in a different order, because of their
 * different roles during exchange of random material.  The references to
 * the \c key_source2 structure in the list below is only valid if %key
 * method 2 is being used.  See the \link key_generation data channel key
 * generation\endlink related page for more information.
 *
 * Clients follow this order:
 *   -# \c S_INITIAL, ready to begin three-way handshake and control
 *      channel negotiation.
 *   -# \c S_PRE_START, have started three-way handshake, waiting for
 *      acknowledgment from remote.
 *   -# \c S_START, initial three-way handshake complete.
 *   -# \c S_SENT_KEY, have sent local part of \c key_source2 random
 *      material.
 *   -# \c S_GOT_KEY, have received remote part of \c key_source2 random
 *      material.
 *   -# \c S_ACTIVE, normal operation during remaining handshake window.
 *   -# \c S_NORMAL_OP, normal operation.
 *
 * Servers follow the same order, except for \c S_SENT_KEY and \c
 * S_GOT_KEY being reversed, because the server first receives the
 * client's \c key_source2 random material before generating and sending
 * its own.
