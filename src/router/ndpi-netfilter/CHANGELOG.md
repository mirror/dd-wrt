# CHANGELOG


#### nDPI 5.0 (Nov 2025)

## Major Changes

 - Create a new nDPI fingerprint, combining TCP fingerprint, JA4 fingepriint and TLS SHA1 certificate (or JA3S if SHA1 is missing). See: https://www.ntop.org/beyond-ja3-ja4-introducing-ndpi-traffic-fingerprint/
 - Add detection of (TLS/QUIC/HTTP) flows whose hostname was not previously resolved via DNS. See: https://www.ntop.org/when-snis-cannot-be-trusted/
 - Add support for an unlimited number of (custom) protocols. See https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/issues/2136
 - Extend custom rules (see https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/blob/dev/example/protos.txt for some examples):
   - match via JA4 (https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/commit/087726d12d35299c1127910cd5c46e8170561f87)
   - match via nDPI fingerprint (https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/commit/7c53fcde85ae7c5584e7e14499b6aed497ef1af8)
   - match via HTTP URL (https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/commit/5abe185e2c44b18e422ef8a746487271a0292781, https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/pull/3014)
   - support for category and breed in custom rules (https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/pull/2872)

## Important API Changes

 - Building system: you need to explicitly call `configure` script: `./autogen.sh && ./configure --$OPTIONS & make`. See: https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/pull/2993
 - Remove `ndpi_set_protocol_detection_bitmask2()`: all protocols are enabled by default. If you need to disable some protocols you can use the usual `ndpi_set_config()`
 - The defines `NDPI_MAX_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOLS` and `NDPI_MAX_NUM_CUSTOM_PROTOCOLS` have been removed: the number of protocols should be gotten only at runtime, via `ndpi_get_num_protocols()`
 - Remove `NDPI_PROTOCOL_BITMASK` (because its size is hardcoded to 512). Create a new structure, `ndpi_bitmask`, where the max number of bits is specified at runtime
 - Change the return parameter of `ndpi_detection_process_packet()`; get rid of `ndpi_extra_dissection_possible()`. See: https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/pull/2942
 - Remove `NDPI_PROTOCOL_ADULT_CONTENT`, `NDPI_PROTOCOL_LLM` and `NDPI_PROTOCOL_ADS_ANALYTICS_TRACK` because they are not real protocol: keep only the categories with a similar name
 - Modify the API to set a custom memory allocator
 - Added ability to export host-based configuration (https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/pull/3022)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### nDPI 3.0 (October 2019)

## New Features
 - nDPI now reports the protocol ASAP even when specific fields have not yet been dissected because such packets have not yet been observed. This is important for inline applications that can immediately act on traffic. Applications that need full dissection need to call the new API function ndpi_extra_dissection_possible() to check if metadata dissection has been completely performed or if there is more to read before declaring it completed.
 - TLS (formerly identified as SSL in nDPI v2.x) is now dissected more deeply, certificate validity is extracted as well certificate SHA-1.
 - nDPIreader can now export data in CSV format with option `-C`
 - Implemented Sequence of Packet Length and Time (SPLT) and Byte Distribution (BD) as specified by Cisco Joy (https://github.com/cisco/joy). This allows malware activities on encrypted TLS streams. Read more at https://blogs.cisco.com/security/detecting-encrypted-malware-traffic-without-decryption
   - Available as library and in `ndpiReader` with option `-J`
 - Promoted usage of protocol categories rather than protocol identifiers in order to classify protocols. This allows application protocols to be clustered in families and thus better managed by users/developers rather than using hundred of protocols unknown to most of the people.
 - Added Inter-Arrival Time (IAT) calculation used to detect protocol misbehaviour (e.g. slow-DoS detection)
 - Added data analysis features for computign metrics such as entropy, average, stddev, variance on a single and consistent place that will prevent when possible. This should ease traffic analysis on monitoring/security applications. New API calls have been implemented such as ndpi_data_XXX() to handle these calculations.
 - Initial release of Python bindings available under nDPI/python.
 - Implemented search of human readable strings for promoting data exfiltration detection
   - Available as library and in `ndpiReader` with option `-e`
 - Fingerprints
   - JA3 (https://github.com/salesforce/ja3)
