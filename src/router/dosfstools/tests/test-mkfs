# This script expects a testname.mkfs file as its sole argument. It must
# be a shell snippet setting the variables ARGS, SIZE and CMP_LIMIT. ARGS and
# SIZE are used in the mkfs invocation and the result is compared against a
# reference image generated from the hexdump in testname.xxd. The comparison
# is stopped after CMP_LIMIT since freshly build FAT filesystems are just
# zeros after the initial info sectors, FATs and root directory.
