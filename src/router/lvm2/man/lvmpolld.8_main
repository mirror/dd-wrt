.SH DESCRIPTION
lvmpolld is polling daemon for LVM. The daemon receives requests for polling
of already initialised operations originating in LVM2 command line tool.
The requests for polling originate in the \fBlvconvert\fP, \fBpvmove\fP,
\fBlvchange\fP or \fBvgchange\fP LVM2 commands.

The purpose of lvmpolld is to reduce the number of spawned background processes
per otherwise unique polling operation. There should be only one. It also
eliminates the possibility of unsolicited termination of background process by
external factors.

lvmpolld is used by LVM only if it is enabled in \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) by
specifying the \fBglobal/use_lvmpolld\fP setting. If this is not defined in the
LVM configuration explicitly then default setting is used instead (see the
output of \fBlvmconfig --type default global/use_lvmpolld\fP command).
.SH OPTIONS

To run the daemon in a test environment both the pidfile_path and the
socket_path should be changed from the defaults.
.TP
.BR -f ", " --foreground
Don't fork, but run in the foreground.
.TP
.BR -h ", " --help
Show help information.
.TP
.IR \fB-l\fP ", " \fB--log\fP " {" all | wire | debug }
Select the type of log messages to generate.
Messages are logged by syslog.
Additionally, when -f is given they are also sent to standard error.
There are two classes of messages: wire and debug. Selecting 'all' supplies both
and is equivalent to a comma-separated list -l wire,debug.
.TP
.BR -p ", " --pidfile " " \fIpidfile_path
Path to the pidfile. This overrides both the built-in default
(#DEFAULT_PID_DIR#/lvmpolld.pid) and the environment variable
\fBLVM_LVMPOLLD_PIDFILE\fP.  This file is used to prevent more
than one instance of the daemon running simultaneously.
.TP
.BR -s ", " --socket " " \fIsocket_path
Path to the socket file. This overrides both the built-in default
(#DEFAULT_RUN_DIR#/lvmpolld.socket) and the environment variable
\fBLVM_LVMPOLLD_SOCKET\fP.
.TP
.BR -t ", " --timeout " " \fItimeout_value
The daemon may shutdown after being idle for the given time (in seconds). When the
option is omitted or the value given is zero the daemon never shutdowns on idle.
.TP
.BR -B ", " --binary " " \fIlvm_binary_path
Optional path to alternative LVM binary (default: #LVM_PATH#). Use for
testing purposes only.
.TP
.BR -V ", " --version
Display the version of lvmpolld daemon.
.TP
.B --dump
Contact the running lvmpolld daemon to obtain the complete state and print it
out in a raw format.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
.B LVM_LVMPOLLD_PIDFILE
Path for the pid file.
.TP
.B LVM_LVMPOLLD_SOCKET
Path for the socket file.
