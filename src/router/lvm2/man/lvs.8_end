.SH NOTES
.
The lv_attr bits are:
.IP 1 3
Volume type: (C)ache, (m)irrored, (M)irrored without initial sync, (o)rigin,
(O)rigin with merging snapshot, (r)aid, (R)aid without initial sync,
(s)napshot, merging (S)napshot, (p)vmove, (v)irtual,
mirror or raid (i)mage, mirror or raid (I)mage out-of-sync, mirror (l)og device,
under (c)onversion, thin (V)olume, (t)hin pool, (T)hin pool data, raid or
pool m(e)tadata or pool metadata spare.
.IP 2 3
Permissions: (w)riteable, (r)ead-only, (R)ead-only activation of non-read-only
volume
.IP 3 3
Allocation policy:  (a)nywhere, (c)ontiguous, (i)nherited, c(l)ing, (n)ormal
This is capitalised if the volume is currently locked against allocation
changes, for example during
.BR pvmove (8).
.IP 4 3
fixed (m)inor
.IP 5 3
State: (a)ctive, (h)istorical, (s)uspended, (I)nvalid snapshot,
invalid (S)uspended snapshot, snapshot (m)erge failed,
suspended snapshot (M)erge failed, mapped (d)evice present without tables,
mapped device present with (i)nactive table, thin-pool (c)heck needed,
suspended thin-pool (C)heck needed, (X) unknown
.IP 6 3
device (o)pen, (X) unknown
.IP 7 3
Target type: (C)ache, (m)irror, (r)aid, (s)napshot, (t)hin, (u)nknown, (v)irtual.
This groups logical volumes related to the same kernel target together.  So,
for example, mirror images, mirror logs as well as mirrors themselves appear as
(m) if they use the original device-mapper mirror kernel driver; whereas the raid
equivalents using the md raid kernel driver all appear as (r).
Snapshots using the original device-mapper driver appear as (s); whereas
snapshots of thin volumes using the new thin provisioning driver appear as (t).
.IP 8 3
Newly-allocated data blocks are overwritten with blocks of (z)eroes before use.
.IP 9 3
Volume Health, where there are currently three groups of attributes identified:
.IP
Common ones for all Logical Volumes: (p)artial, (X) unknown.
.br
(p)artial signifies that one or more of the Physical Volumes this Logical
Volume uses is missing from the system. (X) unknown signifies the status
is unknown.
.IP
Related to RAID Logical Volumes: (r)efresh needed, (m)ismatches exist, (w)ritemostly.
.br
(r)efresh signifies that one or more of the Physical Volumes this RAID Logical
Volume uses had suffered a write error. The write error could be due to a
temporary failure of that Physical Volume or an indication that it is failing.
The device should be refreshed or replaced. (m)ismatches signifies that the
RAID logical volume has portions of the array that are not coherent.
Inconsistencies are detected by initiating a "check" on a RAID logical volume.
(The scrubbing operations, "check" and "repair", can be performed on a RAID
logical volume via the 'lvchange' command.)  (w)ritemostly signifies the
devices in a RAID 1 logical volume that have been marked write-mostly.
Re(s)haping signifies a RAID Logical Volume is either undergoing a stripe
addition/removal, a stripe size or RAID algorithm change.
(R)emove after reshape signifies freed striped raid images to be removed.
.IP
Related to Thin pool Logical Volumes: (F)ailed, out of (D)ata space,
(M)etadata read only.
.br
(F)ailed is set if thin pool encounters serious failures and hence no further I/O
is permitted at all. The out of (D)ata space is set if thin pool has run out of
data space. (M)etadata read only signifies that thin pool encounters certain
types of failures but it's still possible to do reads at least,
but no metadata changes are allowed.
.IP
Related to Thin Logical Volumes: (F)ailed.
.br
(F)ailed is set when related thin pool enters Failed state and no further I/O
is permitted at all.
.IP 10 3
s(k)ip activation: this volume is flagged to be skipped during activation.
