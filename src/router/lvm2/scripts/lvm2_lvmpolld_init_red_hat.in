### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides: lvm2-lvmpolld
# Required-Start: $local_fs
# Required-Stop: $local_fs
# Default-Start: 1 2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop: 0 6
# Short-Description: A daemon that is responsible for monitoring in-progress
#		     and possibly longer term operations on logical volumes. 
#		     It helps to reduce the number of spawned processes if same
#                    logical volume is requested to get monitored multiple times.
#                    Also avoids unsolicited termination due to external factors.
