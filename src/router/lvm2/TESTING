LVM2 Test Suite
===============

The codebase contains many tests in the test subdirectory.

Before running tests
--------------------

Keep in mind the testsuite MUST run under root user.

It is recommended not to use LVM on the test machine, especially when running
tests with udev (`make check_system`.)

You MUST disable (or mask) any LVM daemons:

- lvmetad
- dmeventd
- lvmpolld
- lvmdbusd
- lvmlockd
- clvmd
- cmirrord

For running cluster tests, we are using singlenode locking. Pass
`--with-clvmd=singlenode` to configure.

NOTE: This is useful only for testing, and should not be used in produciton
code.

To run D-Bus daemon tests, existing D-Bus session is required.

Running tests
-------------

As root run:

    make check

To run only tests matching a string:

    make check T=test

To skip tests matching a string:

    make check S=test

There are other targets and many environment variables can be used to tweak the
testsuite - for full list and description run `make -C test help`.

Installing testsuite
--------------------

It is possible to install and run a testsuite against installed LVM. Run the
following:

    make -C test install

Then lvm2-testsuite binary can be executed to test installed binaries.

See `lvm2-testsuite --help` for options. The same environment variables can be
used as with `make check`.
