A VPN client compatible with Cisco's EasyVPN equipment.

Supports IPSec (ESP) with Mode Configuration and Xauth.  Supports only
shared-secret IPSec authentication with Xauth,
AES (256, 192, 128), 3DES, 1DES, MD5, SHA1,
DH1/2/5 and IP tunneling.

It runs entirely in userspace. Only "Universal TUN/TAP device
driver support" is needed in kernel.

Required Libraries: libgcrypt (version 1.1.90 for 0.2-rm+zomb-pre7 or later)

It reads configuration data from the following places:

- From command-line options
- From config file(s) specified on the command line
- From /etc/vpnc/default.conf  only if no configfile was given on the command line
- From /etc/vpnc.conf          same as default.conf, ie: both are used, or none
- If a setting is not given in any of those places, it prompts the user.

The configuration information it currently needs is:

          Option Config file item
       --gateway IPSec gateway 
            --id IPSec ID 
     (no option) IPSec secret 
      --username Xauth username 
     (no option) Xauth password 

A sample configuration file is:

# This is a sample configuration file.
IPSec gateway 127.0.0.1
IPSec ID laughing-vpn
IPSec secret hahaha
Xauth username geoffk

Note that all strings start exactly one space after the keyword
string, and run to the end of the line.  This lets you put any kind of
weird character (except CR, LF and NUL) in your strings, but it does mean
you can't add comments after a string, or spaces before them.

It may be easier to use the --print-config option to generate the
config file, and then delete any lines (like a password) that you want
to be prompted for.

If you don't know the Group ID and Secret string, ask your 
administrator. If (s)he declines and refers to the 
configuration files provided for the vpnclient program, tell 
him/her that the contents of that files is (though scrambled) 
not really protected and can be extracted using tools shipped 
with any Linux distribution.

Please note that vpnc itself does NOT setup routing. You need to do this
yourself, or --script resp. "Script" in the config file.
The default script is /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script which sets a default route
to the remote network, or if the Concentrator provided split-network
settings, these are used to setup routes.

This option is passed to system(), so you can use any shell-specials you
like. This script gets called three times:
$reason == pre-init: this is befor vpnc opens the tun device
   so you can do what is neccessary to ensure that it is available.
   Note that none of the variables mentioned below is available
$reason == connect: this is what used to be "Config Script".
   The connection is established, but vpnc will not begin forwarding
   pakets until the script finishs.
$reason == disconnect: This is called just after vpnc received a signal.
   Note that vpnc will not forward packets anymore while the script is
   running or therafter.

Information is passed from vpnc via enviroment variables:

#* reason                       -- why this script was called, one of: pre-init connect disconnect
#* VPNGATEWAY                   -- vpn gateway address (always present)
#* TUNDEV                       -- tunnel device (always present)
#* INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS         -- address (always present)
#* INTERNAL_IP4_NETMASK         -- netmask (often unset)
#* INTERNAL_IP4_DNS             -- list of dns serverss
#* INTERNAL_IP4_NBNS            -- list of wins servers
#* CISCO_DEF_DOMAIN             -- default domain name
#* CISCO_BANNER                 -- banner from server
#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC              -- number of networks in split-network-list
#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC_%d_ADDR      -- network address
#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC_%d_MASK      -- subnet mask (for example: 255.255.255.0)
#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC_%d_MASKLEN   -- subnet masklen (for example: 24)
#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC_%d_PROTOCOL  -- protocol (often just 0)
#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC_%d_SPORT     -- source port (often just 0)
#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC_%d_DPORT     -- destination port (often just 0)

Currently vpnc-script is not directyl configurable from configfiles.
However, an workaround is to use a "wrapper-script" like this, to
disable /etc/resolv.conf rewriting and setup a custom split-routing:

------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

# this effectively disables changes to /etc/resolv.conf
INTERNAL_IP4_DNS=

# This sets up split networking regardless
# of the concentrators specifications.
# You can add as many routes as you want,
# but you must set the counter $CISCO_SPLIT_INC
# accordingly
CISCO_SPLIT_INC=1
CISCO_SPLIT_INC_0_ADDR=131.246.89.7
CISCO_SPLIT_INC_0_MASK=255.255.255.255
CISCO_SPLIT_INC_0_MASKLEN=32
CISCO_SPLIT_INC_0_PROTOCOL=0
CISCO_SPLIT_INC_0_SPORT=0
CISCO_SPLIT_INC_0_DPORT=0

. /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script
------------------------------

Store this example script, for example in /etc/vpnc/custom-script,
do a "chmod +x /etc/vpnc/custom-script" and add
"Script /etc/vpnc/custom-script" to your configuration.
