.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xfs_db
is used to examine an XFS filesystem. Under rare circumstances it can also
be used to modify an XFS filesystem, but that task is normally left to
.BR xfs_repair (8)
or to scripts such as
.BR xfs_admin (8)
that run
.BR xfs_db .
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c " cmd"
.B xfs_db
commands may be run interactively (the default) or as arguments
on the command line. Multiple
.B \-c
arguments may be given. The commands are run in the sequence given,
then the program exits. This is the mechanism used to implement
.BR xfs_check (8).
.TP
.B \-f
Specifies that the filesystem image to be processed is stored in a
regular file at
.I device
(see the
.BR mkfs.xfs "(8) " -d
.I file
option).
This might happen if an image copy of a filesystem has been made into
an ordinary file with
.BR xfs_copy (8).
.TP
.B \-F
Specifies that we want to continue even if the superblock magic is not
correct.  For use in
.BR xfs_check
and
.BR xfs_metadump .
.TP
.B \-i
Allows execution on a mounted filesystem, provided it is mounted read-only.
Useful for shell scripts such as
.BR xfs_check (8),
which must only operate on filesystems in a guarenteed consistent state
(either unmounted or mounted read-only). These semantics are slightly
different to that of the
.B -r
option.
.TP
.BI \-l " logdev"
Specifies the device where the filesystems external log resides.
Only for those filesystems which use an external log. See the
.BR mkfs.xfs "(8) " \-l
option, and refer to
.BR xfs (5)
for a detailed description of the XFS log.
.TP
.BI \-p " progname"
Set the program name to
.I progname
for prompts and some error messages, the default value is
.BR xfs_db .
.TP
.B -r
Open
.I device
or
.I filename
read-only. This option is required if the filesystem is mounted.
It is only necessary to omit this flag if a command that changes data
.RB ( write ", " blocktrash )
is to be used.
.TP
.B \-x
Specifies expert mode.
This enables the
.B write
and
.B blocktrash
commands.
.TP
.B \-V
Prints out the current version number and exits.
.SH CONCEPTS
.B xfs_db
commands can be broken up into two classes. Most commands are for
the navigation and display of data structures in the filesystem.
Other commands are for scanning the filesystem in some way.
.PP
Commands which are used to navigate the filesystem structure take arguments
which reflect the names of filesystem structure fields.
There can be multiple field names separated by dots when the underlying
structures are nested, as in C.
The field names can be indexed (as an array index)
if the underlying field is an array.
The array indices can be specified as a range, two numbers separated by a dash.
.PP
.B xfs_db
maintains a current address in the filesystem.
The granularity of the address is a filesystem structure.
This can be a filesystem block,
an inode or quota (smaller than a filesystem block),
or a directory block (could be larger than a filesystem block).
There are a variety of commands to set the current address.
Associated with the current address is the current data type,
which is the structural type of this data.
Commands which follow the structure of the filesystem always set the type
as well as the address.
Commands which examine pieces of an individual file (inode) need the current
inode to be set, this is done with the
.B inode
command.
.PP
The current address/type information is actually maintained in a
stack that can be explicitly manipulated with the
.BR push ", " pop ", and " stack
commands.
This allows for easy examination of a nested filesystem structure.
Also, the last several locations visited are stored in a ring buffer
which can be manipulated with the
.BR forward ", " back ", and " ring
commands.
.PP
XFS filesystems are divided into a small number of allocation groups.
.B xfs_db
maintains a notion of the current allocation group which is
manipulated by some commands. The initial allocation group is 0.
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
Many commands have extensive online help. Use the
.B help
command for more details on any command.
.TP
.B a
See the
.B addr
command.
.TP
.BI ablock " filoff"
Set current address to the offset
.I filoff
(a filesystem block number) in the attribute area of the current inode.
.TP
.BI "addr [" field-expression ]
Set current address to the value of the
.IR field-expression .
This is used to "follow" a reference in one structure to the object
being referred to. If no argument is given, the current address is printed.
.TP
.BI "agf [" agno ]
Set current address to the AGF block for allocation group
.IR agno .
If no argument is given, use the current allocation group.
.TP
.BI "agfl [" agno ]
Set current address to the AGFL block for allocation group
.IR agno .
If no argument is given, use the current allocation group.
.TP
.BI "agi [" agno ]
Set current address to the AGI block for allocation group
.IR agno .
If no argument is given, use the current allocation group.
.TP
.B b
See the
.B back
command.
.TP
.B back
Move to the previous location in the position ring.
.TP
.B blockfree
Free block usage information collected by the last execution of the
.B blockget
command. This must be done before another
.B blockget
command can be given, presumably with different arguments than the previous one.
.TP
.BI "blockget [\-npvs] [\-b " bno "] ... [\-i " ino "] ..."
Get block usage and check filesystem consistency.
The information is saved for use by a subsequent
.BR blockuse ", " ncheck ", or " blocktrash
command. See
.BR xfs_check (8)
for more information.
.RS 1.0i
.TP 0.4i
.B \-b
is used to specify filesystem block numbers about which verbose
information should be printed.
.TP
.B \-i
is used to specify inode numbers about which verbose information
should be printed.
.TP
.B \-n
is used to save pathnames for inodes visited, this is used to support the
.BR xfs_ncheck (8)
command. It also means that pathnames will be printed for inodes that have
problems. This option uses a lot of memory so is not enabled by default.
.TP
.B \-p
causes error messages to be prefixed with the filesystem name being
processed. This is useful if several copies of
.B xfs_db
are run in parallel.
.TP
.B \-s
restricts output to severe errors only. This is useful if the output is
too long otherwise.
.TP
.B \-v
enables verbose output. Messages will be printed for every block and
inode processed.
.RE
.TP
.BI "blocktrash [\-n " count "] [\-x " min "] [\-y " max "] [\-s " seed "] [\-0|1|2|3] [\-t " type "] ..."
Trash randomly selected filesystem metadata blocks.
Trashing occurs to randomly selected bits in the chosen blocks.
This command is available only in debugging versions of

It is useful for testing
.BR xfs_repair "(8) and " xfs_check (8).
.RS 1.0i
.TP 0.4i
.BR \-0 " | " -1 " | " -2 " | " -3

.I count
of block-trashings to perform (default 1).
.TP
.B \-s
supplies a
.I seed
to the random processing.
.TP
.B \-t
gives a
.I type
of blocks to be selected for trashing. Multiple
.B \-t
options may be given. If no
.B \-t
options are given then all metadata types can be trashed.
.TP
.B \-x
sets the
.I minimum
size of bit range to be trashed. The default value is 1.
.TP
.B \-y
sets the
.I maximum
size of bit range to be trashed. The default value is 1024.
.RE
.TP

command must have also specified the
.B \-n
option.
.RE
.TP
.BI "bmap [\-a\] [\-d] [" block " [" len ]]
Show the block map for the current inode.
The map display can be restricted to an area of the file with the
.I block
and
.I len
arguments. If
.I block

.BI hash " string
Prints the hash value of
.I string
using the hash function of the XFS directory and attribute implementation.
.TP
.BI "help [" command ]
Print help for one or all commands.
.TP
.BI "inode [" inode# ]
Set the current inode number. If no
.I inode#
is given, print the current inode number.
.TP
.BI "label [" label ]
Set the filesystem label. The filesystem label can be used by
.BR mount (8)
instead of using a device special file.
The maximum length of an XFS label is 12 characters \- use of a longer
.I label
will result in truncation and a warning will be issued. If no
.I label
is given, the current filesystem label is printed.

.BR sb ", " symlink " and " text .
See the TYPES section below for more information on these data types.
.TP
.BI "uuid [" uuid " | " generate " | " rewrite ]
Set the filesystem universally unique identifier (UUID).
The filesystem UUID can be used by
.BR mount (8)
instead of using a device special file.
The
.I uuid
can be set directly to the desired UUID, or it can
be automatically generated using the
.B generate
option. These options will both write the UUID into every copy of the
superblock in the filesystem.
.B rewrite
copies the current UUID from the primary superblock
to all secondary copies of the superblock.
If no argument is given, the current filesystem UUID is printed.
.TP
.BI "version [" feature " | " "versionnum features2" ]
Enable selected features for a filesystem (certain features can
be enabled on an unmounted filesystem, after
.BR mkfs.xfs (8)
has created the filesystem).
Support for unwritten extents can be enabled using the
.B extflg
option. Support for version 2 log format can be enabled using the
.B log2
option. Support for extended attributes can be enabled using the
.B attr1
or
.B attr2
option. Once enabled, extended attributes cannot be disabled, but the user
may toggle between
.B attr1
and
.B attr2
at will (older kernels may not support the newer version).
.IP
If no argument is given, the current version and feature bits are printed.
With one argument, this command will write the updated version number
into every copy of the superblock in the filesystem.
If two arguments are given, they will be used as numeric values for the
.I versionnum
and
.I features2
bits respectively, and their string equivalent reported
(but no modifications are made).
.TP
.BI "write [" "field value" "] ..."
Write a value to disk.
Specific fields can be set in structures (struct mode),
or a block can be set to data values (data mode),
or a block can be set to string values (string mode, for symlink blocks).
The operation happens immediately: there is no buffering.
.IP
Struct mode is in effect when the current type is structural,
i.e. not data. For struct mode, the syntax is "\c
.B write
.I field value\c
".
.IP
Data mode is in effect when the current type is data. In this case the
contents of the block can be shifted or rotated left or right, or filled
with a sequence, a constant value, or a random value. In this mode
.B write
with no arguments gives more information on the allowed commands.
.SH TYPES
This section gives the fields in each structure type and their meanings.
Note that some types of block cover multiple actual structures,
for instance directory blocks.

.B inode
Inodes are allocated in "chunks" of 64 inodes each. Usually a chunk is
multiple filesystem blocks, although there are cases with large filesystem
blocks where a chunk is less than one block. The inode Btree (see
.B inobt
above) refers to the inode numbers per allocation group. The inode numbers
directly reflect the location of the inode block on disk. Use the
.B inode
command to point
.B xfs_db
to a specific inode. Each inode contains four regions:
.BR core ,
.BR next_unlinked ,
.BR u ", and "
.BR a .
.B core
contains the fixed information.
.B next_unlinked
is separated from the core due to journaling considerations, see type
.B agi
field
.BR unlinked .
.B u
is a union structure that is different in size and format depending
on the type and representation of the file data ("data fork").
.B a
is an optional union structure to describe attribute data,
that is different in size, format, and location depending on the presence
and representation of attribute data, and the size of the

Each value counts the number of free extent runs
(consecutive free realtime extents)
of a given range of sizes that starts in a given bitmap block.
The size ranges are binary buckets (low size in the bucket is a power of 2).
