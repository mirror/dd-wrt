.SH NAME
fsck.xfs \- do nothing, successfully
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fsck.xfs
[
.I filesys
\&... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fsck.xfs
is called by the generic Linux
.BR fsck (8)
program at startup to check and repair an XFS filesystem.
XFS is a journaling filesystem and performs recovery at
.BR mount (8)
time if necessary, so
.B fsck.xfs
simply exits with a zero exit status.
.PP
If you wish to check the consistency of an XFS filesystem,
or repair a damaged or corrupt XFS filesystem,
see
.BR xfs_repair (8).
.PP
However, the system administrator can force
.B fsck.xfs
to run
.BR xfs_repair (8)
at boot time by creating a /forcefsck file or booting the system with
"fsck.mode=force" on the kernel command line.
