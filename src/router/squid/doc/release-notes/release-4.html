<H2><A NAME="s1">1.</A> <A HREF="#toc1">Notice</A></H2>

<P>The Squid Team are pleased to announce the release of Squid-4.0.19 for testing.</P>
<P>This new release is available for download from 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/">http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/</A> or the
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/http-mirrors.html">mirrors</A>.</P>

<P>While this release is not deemed ready for production use, we believe it is ready for wider testing by the community.</P>

<P>We welcome feedback and bug reports. If you find a bug, please see 
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/BugReporting">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/BugReporting</A>
for how to submit a report with a stack trace.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1</A> <A HREF="#toc1.1">Known issues</A>
</H2>

<P>Although this release is deemed good enough for use in many setups, please note the existence of 
<A HREF="http://bugs.squid-cache.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&amp;product=Squid&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;version=4">open bugs against Squid-4</A>.</P>

<P>This release adds a dependency on C++11 support in any compiler used to build Squid.
As a result older C++03 -only and most C++0x compilers will no longer build successfully.
GCC 4.9+ and Clang 3.5+ are known to have working C++11 support and are usable.
GCC-4.8 will also build for now despite lack of full C++11 support, but some future features may not be available.</P>

<P>This release does not support LibreSSL.
Due to a bug in the way LibreSSL uses the OpenSSL version macro some changes
necessary to support OpenSSL 1.1 prevent building with LibreSSL.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2</A> <A HREF="#toc1.2">Changes since earlier releases of Squid-4</A>
</H2>

<P>The Squid-4 change history can be 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/">viewed here</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s2">2.</A> <A HREF="#toc2">Major new features since Squid-3.5</A></H2>

<P>Squid 4 represents a new feature release above 3.5.</P>

<P>The most important of these new features are:
<UL>
<LI>Configurable helper queue size</LI>
<LI>Helper concurrency channels changes</LI>
<LI>SSL support removal</LI>
<LI>Helper Binary Changes</LI>
<LI>Secure ICAP</LI>
<LI>Improved SMP support</LI>
<LI>Improved process management</LI>
<LI>Initial GnuTLS support</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="#toc2.1">Configurable helper queue size</A>
</H2>

<P>The new queue-size=N option to helpers configuration, allows users 
to configure the maximum number of queued requests to busy helpers.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="#toc2.2">Helper concurrency channels changes</A>
</H2>

<P>helper-mux.pl we have been distributing for the past few years to
encourage use of concurrency is no longer compatible with Squid. If
used it will spawn up to 2^64 helpers and DoS the Squid server.</P>

<P>Helpers utilizing arrays to handle fixed amounts of concurrency
channels MUST be re-written to use queues and capable of handling a
64-bit int as index or they will be vulnerable to buffer overrun and
arbitrary memory accesses.</P>

<P>32-bit helpers need re-writing to handle the concurrency channel ID
as a 64-bit integer value. If not updated they will cause proxies to
return unexpected results or timeout once crossing the 32-bit wrap
boundary. Leading to undefined behaviour in the client HTTP traffic.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="#toc2.3">SSL support removal</A>
</H2>

<P>Details in 
<A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6176">RFC 6176</A>
and 
<A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7568">RFC 7568</A></P>

<P>SSLv2 is not fit for purpose. Squid no longer supports being configured with
any settings regarding this protocol. That includes settings manually disabling
its use since it is now forced to disable by default. Also settings enabling
various client/server workarounds specific to SSLv2 are removed.</P>

<P>SSLv3 is not fit for purpose. Squid still accepts configuration, but use
is deprecated and will be removed entirely in a future version.
Squid default behavour is to follow the TLS built in negotiation mechanism
which prefers the latest TLS version. But also to accept downgrades to SSLv3.
Use <EM>tls-options=NO_SSLv3</EM> to disable SSLv3 support completely.</P>

<P>A new option <EM>tls-min-version=1.N</EM> is added in place of <EM>sslversion=</EM>
to configure the minimum version the TLS negotiation will allow to be used
when an old TLS version is requested by the remote endpoint.</P>

<P>The system Trusted CAs are no longer used by default when verifying client
certificates. The <EM>cafile=</EM> option should be used instead to load
the specific CA which signed acceptible client certificates explicitly,
even if that CA is one of the system Trusted CAs.
The <EM>tls-default-ca</EM> option can be used to restore the old
behaviour explicitly if needed.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="#toc2.4">Helper Binary Changes</A>
</H2>

<P>The <EM>basic_msnt_multi_domain_auth</EM> helper has been removed. The
<EM>basic_smb_lm_auth</EM> helper performs the same actions without extra
Perl and Samba dependencies.</P>

<P>The <EM>cert_valid.pl</EM> testing helper has been renamed to
<EM>security_fake_certverify</EM>, reflecting the Squid helper naming schema
and that it does not actually perform any certificate checks.</P>

<P>The <EM>security_fake_certverify</EM> helper is also now built and installed
by default. It is written in Perl so does not require OpenSSL dependencies
for installation. But does use the Perl Crypt::OpenSSL::X509 module for execution.
Building the helper can be controlled using the <EM>--enable-security-cert-validators="fake"</EM>
option.</P>

<P>The <EM>ssl_crtd</EM> helper has been renamed to <EM>security_file_certgen</EM>
and is now built and installed by default whenever OpenSSL support is enabled.
Building the helper can be controlled using the <EM>--enable-security-cert-generators="file"</EM>
option.
NOTE: The <EM>--enable-ssl-crtd</EM> option is still required to enable the
<EM>sslcrtd_program</EM> helper interface within Squid that uses the helper.</P>

<P>The <EM>ntlm_smb_lm_auth</EM> helper is now built using <EM>--enable-auth-ntlm="SMB_LM"</EM>.
Notice the upper case where it was previously a (wrongly) lower cased acronym.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5</A> <A HREF="#toc2.5">Secure ICAP</A>
</H2>

<P>ICAP services can now be used over TLS connections.</P>

<P>To mark an ICAP service as secure, use an <EM>icaps://</EM> service URI scheme when
listing your service via an icap_service directive. The industry is using a
<EM>Secure ICAP</EM> term, and Squid follows that convention, but <EM>icaps</EM> seems more
appropriate for a <EM>scheme</EM> name.</P>

<P>Squid uses <EM>port 11344</EM> for Secure ICAP by default, following another popular
proxy convention. The old 1344 default for plain ICAP ports has not changed.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6</A> <A HREF="#toc2.6">Improved SMP support</A>
</H2>

<P>Use of C++11 atomic operations instead of GNU atomics allows a wider range of
operating systems and compilers to build Squid SMP and multi-process features.
However this does require a C++11 or C++0x compiler with a recent version of
the C++ standard library.</P>

<P>IpcIo and Mmapped disk I/O modules are now auto-detected properly which
enables Rock storage on more systems by default than previously.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.7">2.7</A> <A HREF="#toc2.7">Improved process management</A>
</H2>

<P>Squid is traditionally refered to as a daemon. But is actually a combination
of daemon and daemon manager processes. This has caused significant problems
integrating it with other third-party daemon managers.</P>

<P>The Squid process which places its PID into the squid.pid file has always
been the process to which control signals are sent. The manager process is
now taking on signal handling instead of the main daemon process. Enabling
integration with daemon managers such as Upstart or systemd which assume the
process they initiated is the daemon with a PID to control.</P>

<P>The squid binary now has a new <EM>--foreground</EM> command line option
which prevents the process from exiting early while background workers
continue their processing. When run with this option Squid will now wait
for the worker(s) to finish before exiting. Unlike the old <EM>-N</EM> option
<EM>--foreground</EM> supports SMP workers and multi-process features.
<EM>--foreground</EM> is particularly useful for use with <EM>-z</EM> (disk
cache structures creation), as it allows the caller to wait until Squid has
finished.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.8">2.8</A> <A HREF="#toc2.8">Initial GnuTLS support</A>
</H2>

<P>If all you need is a proxy that connects over TLS/SSL to a <EM>cache_peer</EM>
or accepts <EM>https://</EM> URLs over clear-text and performs the necessary
upstream TLS connections. Then you now have the choice to build Squid with
GnuTLS instead of OpenSSL.</P>

<P><EM>squid.conf</EM> directives and configuration options which have undergone
name changes from 'ssl' to 'tls' prefix in Squid-4 have GnuTLS support, unless
explicitly stated otherwise.</P>

<P>Advanced configuration with specific selection of ciphers and similar settings
should still work, but needs the GnuTLS <EM>Priority Strings</EM> instead of
the OpenSSL options when using GnuTLS.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s3">3.</A> <A HREF="#toc3">Changes to squid.conf since Squid-3.5</A></H2>

<P>There have been changes to Squid's configuration file since Squid-3.5.</P>
