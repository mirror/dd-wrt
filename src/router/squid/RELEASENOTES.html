<H2><A NAME="s1">1.</A> <A HREF="#toc1">Key changes from squid 2.5</A></H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Major improvements to the way that Squid handles web proxy, accelerated 
and transparent proxy requests to make it easier to configure transparent and 
acceleration functionality.  The default behaviour is to function as a standard 
HTTP proxy on each port that Squid is configured to listen on, but in addition 
in this release the keywords "accelerated" and "transparent" can be specified 
after each port to indicate to Squid the functionality that is to be enabled on 
that port.  This means that the old config directives relating to httpd_accel_* 
are now deprecated.</LI>
<LI>WCCPv2 support multiple cache engines registering with multiple WCCP 
routers and switches.  WCCPv2 is preferred over WCCPv1 for performance and 
flexibility reasons if your router or switch is able to support it (all recent 
versions of IOS do so).  Initially WCCPv2 under Linux is limited to registration 
with only one router due to kernel limitations in more recent versions, although 
this will be addressed in a future release of Squid.</LI>
<LI>TPROXY totally transparent proxy support under Linux, which to allow Squid 
to appear totally invisible to both client and server systems when transparently 
caching requests.  This works by spoofing the source and destination address to 
both the client and server.</LI>
<LI>Support for Etag and Vary HTTP headers.  This further moves Squid towards 
HTTP/1.1 compliance.  The Vary header field is used for improved caching and 
delivery of customized content to end clients, and the Etag is used similar to 
an MD5 checksum between client and server to determine if a web page has changed 
since it was last retrieved.</LI>
<LI>Collapsed forwarding, which gives Squid the ability to intelligently merge 
client requests for objects into one request to the server.  Of particular 
benefit in accelerator setups but also provides some benefits to non accelerator 
setups.</LI>
<LI>Support for epoll under Linux and kqueue under FreeBSD, which gives Squid
the ability to handle many many more concurrent requests with lower CPU
overhead. This feature is of particular benefit to very busy caches 
as the poll() and select() routines do not scale anywhere near as well as epoll 
and kqueue does under high loads.</LI>
<LI>SSL assisted hardware encryption making use of OpenSSL functionality 
within Squid.</LI>
<LI>Logging enhancements to allow even greater customization of the way Squid 
logs requests in the access-log or to syslog if required</LI>
<LI>Authentication enhancements including Negotiate/Kerberos support, extra
workarounds for NTLM clients and others using Microsoft Integrated Login.</LI>
<LI>Additional external_acl parameters to support SSL and even more client 
side parameters.</LI>
<LI>ACL changes in conjunction with SSL changes which have been merged, to 
allow matching based on SSL certificate parameters.</LI>
<LI>Improvements to Cygwin support for users who wish to run Squid in a 
Microsoft Windows/Cygwin environment as a system service.</LI>
<LI>New authentication helpers:
<UL>
<LI>Digest LDAP helper</LI>
<LI>Native Windows basic, NTLM and negotiate helpers</LI>
<LI>External acl helpers for session monitoring and native Windows group
membership check</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>HTCP significantly cleaned up and added support for the CLR operation to purge contents from the cache</LI>
<LI>Support for parsing X-Forwarded-For headers allowing access controls to be based on the real client IP even if behind secondary proxies</LI>
<LI>Support for proxying of Microsoft Integrated Login (NTLM &amp; Negotiate) connection oriented authentication schemes, enabling access to servers or proxies using such authentication methods.</LI>
<LI>Support for the Linux TPROXY patch allowing Squid to masquerade using the clients original IP address</LI>
<LI>urlgroups, tagging URLs for redirection and access controls, and divides the cache allowing different users to get different results for the same URL.</LI>
<LI>Optional automatic monotoring of cache peers and configured origin servers</LI>
<LI>SSL client support, allowing both http->https gatewaying and SSL encrypted peers (both origin servers and proxies).</LI>
<LI>Full ETag/Vary based caching, allowing efficient caching of server driven content negotiation.</LI>
<LI>Customizable access log format</LI>
<LI>Selective access logging, and ability to log to more than access log possibly in different formats</LI>
<LI>New more efficient helper protocol allowing for multiple concurrent lookups to the same helper</LI>
<LI>Ability to rewrite Location headers (redirects sent by servers)</LI>
<LI></LI>

<P>Ipfilter 4.x compile problem on HP Tru64
<UL>
<LI>Running configure --enable-ipf-transparent on an HP Tru64 5.1B system with ipfilter 4.x installed, the following error can occur:
<PRE>
      checking if IP-Filter header files are installed... no
      WARNING: Cannot find necessary IP-Filter header files
               Transparent Proxy support WILL NOT be enabled
</PRE>

To fix the problem first check if the ip_fil.h, ip_compat.h, ip_nat.h and ipl.h files are present in
/usr/include/netinet and copy them from ipfilter source tree if needed.
Don't forget to fix files permission and ownership after the copy.<BR>
If the error still persist, run configure making it skip the ip_compat.h test:<BR>
<PRE>
    env ac_cv_header_netinet_ip_compat_h=yes ./configure --enable-ipf-transparent
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>On Sun Solaris 10, ipfilter 4.0.22 is provided with the OS, but related include files (ip_fil.h, ip_compat.h, ip_nat.h, ipl.h) are missing.<BR>
Before running configure --enable-ipf-transparent, they must be downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://cvs.opensolaris.org/source/xref/usr/src/common/ipf/">OpenSolaris Web Site</A>
in the /usr/include local directory. Don't forget to fix files permission and ownership after the download.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="s6">6.</A> <A HREF="#toc6">Windows support</A></H2>

<P>This Squid version can run on Windows as a system service using the Cygwin emulation environment, 
or can be compiled in Windows native mode using the MinGW + MSYS development environment. Windows NT 4 SP4 and later are supported.<BR>
On Windows 2000 and later the service is configured to use the Windows Service Recovery option
restarting automatically after 60 seconds.
<DL>

<DT><B>Usage</B><DD><P>Some new command line options was added for the Windows service support:<BR></P>
<P>The service installation is made with -i command line switch, it's possible to use -f switch at
the same time for specify a different config-file settings for the Squid Service that will be
stored on the Windows Registry.</P>
<P>A new -n switch specify the Windows Service Name, so multiple Squid instance are allowed.
<EM>"Squid"</EM> is the default when the switch is not used.</P>
<P>So, to install the service, the syntax is: </P>
<P>
<PRE>
squid -i [-f file] [-n name]
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Service uninstallation is made with -r command line switch with the appropriate -n switch.</P>
<P>The -k switch family must be used with the appropriate -f and -n switches, so the syntax is: </P>
<P>
<PRE>
squid -k command [-f file] -n service-name
</PRE>

where <EM>service-name</EM> is the name specified with -n options at service install time.</P>
<P>To use the Squid original command line, the new -O switch must be used ONCE, the syntax is: </P>
<P>
<PRE>
squid -O cmdline [-n service-name]
</PRE>

If multiple service command line options must be specified, use quote. The -n switch is
needed only when a non default service name is in use.</P>
<P>Don't use the "Start parameters" in the Windows 2000/XP/2003 Service applet: they are
specific to Windows services functionality and Squid is not designed for understand they.</P>
<P>In the following example the command line of the "squidsvc" Squid service is set to "-D -u 3130": </P>
<P>
<PRE>
squid -O "-D -u 3130" -n squidsvc
</PRE>

<DT><B>PSAPI.DLL (Process Status Helper) Considerations</B><DD><P>The process status helper functions make it easier for you to obtain information about
processes and device drivers running on Microsoft® Windows NT®/Windows® 2000. These
functions are available in PSAPI.DLL, which is distributed in the Microsoft® Platform
Software Development Kit (SDK). The same information is generally available through the
performance data in the registry, but it is more difficult to get to it. PSAPI.DLL is
freely redistributable.</P>
<P>PSAPI.DLL is available only on Windows NT, 2000, XP and 2003. The implementation in Squid is
aware of this, and try to use it only on the right platform.</P>
<P>On Windows NT PSAPI.DLL can be found as component of many applications, if you need it,
you can find it on Windows NT Resource KIT. If you have problem, it can be
downloaded from here:
<A HREF="http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/Redist/4.0.1371.1/NT4/EN-US/psinst.EXE">http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/Redist/4.0.1371.1/NT4/EN-US/psinst.EXE</A></P>
<P>On Windows 2000 and later it is available installing the Windows Support Tools, located on the
Support\Tools folder of the installation Windows CD-ROM.</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>Registry DNS lookup</B><DD><P>On Windows platforms, if no value is specified in the <EM>dns_nameservers</EM> option on
