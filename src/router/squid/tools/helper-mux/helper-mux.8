.SH NAME
helper\-mux \- Concurrency protocol multiplexer for Squid helpers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBhelper-mux\fR helper-path [helper\-options ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBhelper-mux\fR purpose is to relieve some of the burden
\&\fBsquid\fR has when dealing with slow helpers. It does so by acting as a
middleman between \fBsquid\fR and the actual helpers, talking to \fBsquid\fR via
the multiplexed variant of the helper protocol and to the helpers
via the non-multiplexed variant.
.PP
Helpers are started on demand, and in theory the muxer can handle up to
1k helpers per instance. It is up to \fBsquid\fR to decide how many helpers
to start.
.PP
The helper can be controlled using various signals:
\&\- SIGHUP: dump the state of all helpers to STDERR
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP \fBhelper-path\fR 8
.IX Item "helper-path"
Path to the helper being multiplexed.
.IP \fBhelper-options\fR 8
.IX Item "helper-options"
Command line options for the helper being multiplexed.
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
.IX Header "KNOWN ISSUES"
\&\fBhelper-mux\fR knows nothing about the actual messages being passed around,
and as such cannot yet compensate for broken helpers.
.PP
It is not yet able to manage dying helpers.
