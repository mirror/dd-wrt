.SH NAME
.Vb 1
\& delayer \- Squid external ACL helper adding artificial delay to requests
.Ve
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\& delayer [\-\-help] [\-\-debug] [\-\-log file] [\-\-wait msec]
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Squid external acl helper; causes squid to delay responding to HTTP requests.
.PP
By carefully crafting the ACLs of a Squid setup it is possible to
selectively delay requests received by a proxy. After the configured amount
of time, it will always return "true".
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR or \fB\-h\fR" 12
.IX Item "--help or -h"
Print help message to stdout
.IP "\fB\-\-debug\fR or \fB\-d\fR" 12
.IX Item "--debug or -d"
Emit debugging output to STDERR and ultimately cache.log
.IP "\fB\-\-log /path/to/file\fR or \fB\-l /path/to/file\fR" 12
.IX Item "--log /path/to/file or -l /path/to/file"
Emit debugging output to specified file instead of STDERR. Also turns on debugging
.IP "\fB\-\-wait msec\fR or \fB\-w msec\fR" 12
.IX Item "--wait msec or -w msec"
Delay each request by the specified amount of msec.
Unless this option is specified, by default each submitted request
will be delayed by half a second (500 msec).
.SH CONFIGURATION
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
To engage it, this snippet of configuration template can be used in squid.conf:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& external_acl_type delayer concurrency=100000 children\-max=2 children\-startup=1 children\-idle=1 cache=10 %URI /path/to/delayer \-w 200
\& acl delay external delayer
\& http_access allow acl1 acl2 acl3 delay !all
.Ve
.PP
It is important that the acl referencing the delayer be the penultimate clause in the
http_access line. It will cause delay to all requests that match all the
preceding acls in the line. The !all clause at the end of the line will make it
so that no traffic is authorized by this ACL, only the delay to evaluate
the delay clause will be inserted before evaluating following http_access lines.
It is also important to place the http_access line carefully in the sequence
of all http_access_lines; it should be near the beginning, but be careful
not to insert unwanted slow acls (especially proxy_auth).
.PP
It is possible to customize how delay is calculated for each request by
modifying the "calc_delay" PERL function in the script, documentation on this
is embedded in the source code comments.
