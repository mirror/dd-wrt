.SH NAME
log_db_daemon \- Database logging daemon for Squid
.PP
Version 0.5.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
log_db_daemon DSN [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This program writes Squid access.log entries to a database.
Presently only accepts the \fBsquid\fR native log format.
.PP
The script has been developed and tested in the following environment:
.IP "squid\-2.7 Squid\-3.2" 4
.IX Item "squid-2.7 Squid-3.2"
.PD 0
.IP "mysql 5.0.26 and 5.1" 4
.IX Item "mysql 5.0.26 and 5.1"
.IP "perl 5.8.8" 4
.IX Item "perl 5.8.8"
.IP "OpenSUSE 10.2" 4
.IX Item "OpenSUSE 10.2"
.PD
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP \fBDSN\fR 12
.IX Item "DSN"
Database DSN encoded as a path. This is sent as the access_log file path.
.Sp
Sample configuration:
  access_log daemon:/host/database/table/username/password squid
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  to leave a parameter unspecified use a double slash:
\&  access_log daemon://database/table/username/password squid
.Ve
.Sp
Default "DBI:mysql:database=squid"
.IP \fB\-\-debug\fR 12
.IX Item "--debug"
Write debug info to stderr.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
.SS "Squid configuration"
.IX Subsection "Squid configuration"
\fIaccess_log directive\fR
.IX Subsection "access_log directive"
.PP
The path to the access log file is used to provide the database connection parameters.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  access_log daemon:/mysql_host:port/database/table/username/password squid
.Ve
.PP
The 'daemon' prefix is mandatory and tells squid that the \fBlogfile_daemon\fR helper is to be used instead of the normal file logging.
.PP
The last parameter tells squid which log format to use when writing lines to the log daemon.
Presently \fBsquid\fR format is supported.
.IP mysql_host:port 4
.IX Item "mysql_host:port"
Host where the mysql server is running. If left empty, 'localhost' is assumed.
.IP database 4
.IX Item "database"
Name of the database to connect to. If left empty, 'squid_log' is assumed.
.IP table 4
.IX Item "table"
Name of the database table where log lines are stored. If left empty, 'access_log' is assumed.
.IP username 4
.IX Item "username"
Username to use when connecting to the database. If left empty, 'squid' is assumed.
.IP password 4
.IX Item "password"
Password to use when connecting to the database. If left empty, no password is used.
.PP
To leave all fields to their default values, you can use a single slash:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  access_log daemon:/ squid
.Ve
.PP
To specify only the database password, which by default is empty, you must leave unspecified all the other parameters by using null strings:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  access_log daemon://///password squid
.Ve
.PP
\fIlogfile_daemon directive\fR
.IX Subsection "logfile_daemon directive"
.PP
This is the current way of telling squid where the logfile daemon resides.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  logfile_daemon /path/to/squid/libexec/logfile\-daemon_mysql.pl
.Ve
.PP
The script must be copied to the location specified in the directive.
.SS "Database configuration"
.IX Subsection "Database configuration"
Let's call the database 'squid_log' and the log table 'access_log'. The username and password for the db connection will be both 'squid'.
.PP
\fIDatabase\fR
.IX Subsection "Database"
.PP
Create the database:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  CREATE DATABASE squid_log;
.Ve
.PP
\fIUser\fR
.IX Subsection "User"
.PP
Create the user:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  GRANT INSERT,SELECT,CREATE ON squid_log.* TO \*(Aqsquid\*(Aq@\*(Aqlocalhost\*(Aq IDENTIFIED BY \*(Aqsquid\*(Aq;
\&  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
.Ve
.PP
Note that only CREATE, INSERT and SELECT privileges are granted to the 'squid' user. This ensures that the logfile daemon script cannot change or modify the log entries.
.PP
\fITable\fR
.IX Subsection "Table"
.PP
The Daemon will attempt to initialize this table if none exists when it starts.
.PP
The table created should look like:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  CREATE TABLE access_log (
\&    id                   INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
\&    time_since_epoch     DECIMAL(15,3),
\&    time_response        INTEGER,
\&    ip_client            CHAR(15),
\&    ip_server            CHAR(15),
\&    http_status_code     VARCHAR(10),
\&    http_reply_size      INTEGER,
\&    http_method          VARCHAR(20),
\&    http_url             TEXT,
\&    http_username        VARCHAR(20),
\&    http_mime_type       VARCHAR(50),
\&    squid_hier_status    VARCHAR(20),
\&    squid_request_status VARCHAR(20)
\&  );

.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
.IX Header "KNOWN ISSUES"
.SS "Speed issues"
.IX Subsection "Speed issues"
The MyISAM storage engine is known to be faster than the InnoDB one, so although it doesn't support transactions and referential integrity, it might be more appropriate in this scenario. You might want to append "ENGINE=MYISAM" at the end of the table creation code in the above SQL script.
.PP
Indexes should be created according to the queries that are more frequently run. The DDL script only creates an implicit index for the primary key column.
.SS "Table cleanup"
.IX Subsection "Table cleanup"
This script currently implements only the \f(CW\*(C`L\*(C'\fR (i.e. "append a line to the log") command, therefore the log lines are never purged from the table. This approach has an obvious scalability problem.
.PP
One solution would be to implement e.g. the "rotate log" command in a way that would calculate some summary values, put them in a "summary table" and then delete the lines used to calculate those values.
.PP
Similar cleanup code could be implemented in an external script and run periodically independently from squid log commands.
.SS Testing
.IX Subsection "Testing"
This script has only been tested in low-volume scenarios (single client, less than 10 req/s). Tests in high volume environments could reveal performance bottlenecks and bugs.
