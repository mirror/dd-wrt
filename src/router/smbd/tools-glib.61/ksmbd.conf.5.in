.TH KSMBD.CONF "5" "" "ksmbd-tools @ksmbd_tools_version@" "File Formats and Conventions"
.SH NAME
ksmbd.conf \- the configuration file for ksmbd.mountd
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBksmbd.conf\fR is the configuration file for \fBksmbd.mountd\fP(8) user mode daemon.
\fBksmbd.addshare\fP(8) can be used for configuring shares for \fBksmbd.conf\fR.
\fBksmbd.addshare\fR modifies \fBksmbd.conf\fR such that its existing formatting is not retained.
\fBksmbd.addshare\fR notifies \fBksmbd.mountd\fR of changes, if it had made any, by sending the \fBSIGHUP\fR signal to \fBksmbd.mountd\fR.
Changes made with \fBksmbd.addshare\fR will never require restarting \fBksmbd.mountd\fR and \fBksmbd\fR to take effect.
\fBksmbd.control --reload\fR can be used for notifying \fBksmbd.mountd\fR of changes when not using \fBksmbd.addshare\fR.
\fBksmbd.conf\fR is expected to be at \fB@sysconfdir@/ksmbd/ksmbd.conf\fR by default. \" PATH_SMBCONF
A configuration file that may serve as an example can be found at \fB@sysconfdir@/ksmbd/ksmbd.conf.example\fR.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
\fBksmbd.conf\fR consists of sections (i.e. groups) with each section marking the end of the previous one.
A section begins with the section name enclosed in brackets (\fB[]\fR) followed by a newline.
A section may contain parameters separated by newlines.
A parameter consists of a name (i.e. a key) and a value, in that order, separated by an equal sign (\fB=\fR).
A name may contain leading and trailing tabs and spaces.
A value, which begins immediately after the equal sign, may contain leading tabs and spaces or be empty.
A value may be a list of multiple values separated by commas, tabs, and spaces.
For a list of users, all users in a system group are given by giving the group name prefixed with an at (\fB@\fR).
A value may have a number suffix, which is either \fBK\R, \fBM\R, \fBG\R, \fBT\R, \fBP\R, or \fBE\R.
A semicolon (\fB;\fR) or a hash (\fB#\fR) marks the beginning of a comment which continues until the end of the line.
.SH SHARES
Each section name, except that of the \fBglobal\fR section, defines a shared resource, commonly referred to as a share.
A section name, which is the share name, must be UTF-8, [1, 64) bytes, and is case-insensitive. \" KSMBD_REQ_MAX_SHARE_NAME
Users that may be allowed to connect to a share are those that are present in \fBksmbdpwd.db\fP(5) user database.
A share may limit which users are allowed to connect to a particular share.
When connected to a share, the user is mapped to a system user and underlying filesystem permissions are enforced.
By default, this mapping is done by name, but it may also be done by mapping all users connected to the share to a single system user and group.
When connecting as a user not in the user database, only guest sessions may work.
.SH PARAMETERS
Share parameters, marked below with \fB(S)\fR, can be given in any section.
When a share parameter is given in a section other than \fBglobal\fR, it is specific to that particular share.
Under the \fBglobal\fR section, a share parameter sets its default value for all shares.
Global parameters, marked below with \fB(G)\fR, can only be given in the \fBglobal\fR section and control functionality that applies to the server.
Changes to global parameters apply only after restarting \fBksmbd.mountd\fR and \fBksmbd\fR.
