# bash documentation says that precedence order is:
#  ...
#  expr ? expr1 : expr2
#  = *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= &= ^= |=
#  exprA , exprB
# but in practice, the rules for expr1 and expr2 are different:
# assignments and commas in expr1 have higher precedence than :?,
# but in expr2 they haven't:
# "v ? 1,2 : 3,4" is parsed as "(v ? (1,2) : 3),4"
# "v ? a=2 : b=4" is parsed as "(v ? (a=1) : b)=4" (thus, this is a syntax error)
