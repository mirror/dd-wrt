NAME
    BusyBox - The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux

SYNTAX
     BusyBox <function> [arguments...]  # or

     <function> [arguments...]          # if symlinked

DESCRIPTION
    BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a
    single small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of
    the utilities you usually find in GNU coreutils, util-linux, etc. The
    utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their
    full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
    provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
    counterparts.

    BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in
    mind. It is also extremely modular so you can easily include or exclude
    commands (or features) at compile time. This makes it easy to customize
    your embedded systems. To create a working system, just add /dev, /etc,
    and a Linux kernel. BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment
    for any small or embedded system.

    BusyBox is extremely configurable. This allows you to include only the
    components you need, thereby reducing binary size. Run 'make config' or
    'make menuconfig' to select the functionality that you wish to enable.
    Then run 'make' to compile BusyBox using your configuration.

    After the compile has finished, you should use 'make install' to install
    BusyBox. This will install the 'bin/busybox' binary, in the target
    directory specified by PREFIX. PREFIX can be set when configuring
    BusyBox, or you can specify an alternative location at install time
    (i.e., with a command line like 'make PREFIX=/tmp/foo install'). If you
    enabled any applet installation scheme (either as symlinks or
    hardlinks), these will also be installed in the location pointed to by
    PREFIX.

USAGE
    BusyBox is a multi-call binary. A multi-call binary is an executable
    program that performs the same job as more than one utility program.
    That means there is just a single BusyBox binary, but that single binary
    acts like a large number of utilities. This allows BusyBox to be smaller
    since all the built-in utility programs (we call them applets) can share
    code for many common operations.

    You can also invoke BusyBox by issuing a command as an argument on the
    command line. For example, entering

            /bin/busybox ls

    will also cause BusyBox to behave as 'ls'.

    Of course, adding '/bin/busybox' into every command would be painful. So
    most people will invoke BusyBox using links to the BusyBox binary.

    For example, entering

            ln -s /bin/busybox ls
            ./ls

    will cause BusyBox to behave as 'ls' (if the 'ls' command has been
    compiled into BusyBox). Generally speaking, you should never need to
    make all these links yourself, as the BusyBox build system will do this
    for you when you run the 'make install' command.

    If you invoke BusyBox with no arguments, it will provide you with a list
    of the applets that have been compiled into your BusyBox binary.

COMMON OPTIONS
    Most BusyBox commands support the --help argument to provide a terse
    runtime description of their behavior. If the
    CONFIG_FEATURE_VERBOSE_USAGE option has been enabled, more detailed
    usage information will also be available.

    init
        init

        Init is the parent of all processes.

        This version of init is designed to be run only by the kernel.

        BusyBox init doesn't support multiple runlevels. The runlevels field
        of the /etc/inittab file is completely ignored by BusyBox init. If
        you want runlevels, use sysvinit.

        BusyBox init works just fine without an inittab. If no inittab is
        found, it has the following default behavior:

                ::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
                ::askfirst:/bin/sh
                ::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot
                ::shutdown:/sbin/swapoff -a
                ::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r
                ::restart:/sbin/init

        if it detects that /dev/console is _not_ a serial console, it will
        also run:

                tty2::askfirst:/bin/sh
                tty3::askfirst:/bin/sh
                tty4::askfirst:/bin/sh

        If you choose to use an /etc/inittab file, the inittab entry format
        is as follows:

                <id>:<runlevels>:<action>:<process>

                <id>:

                        WARNING: This field has a non-traditional meaning for BusyBox init!
                        The id field is used by BusyBox init to specify the controlling tty for
                        the specified process to run on.  The contents of this field are
                        appended to "/dev/" and used as-is.  There is no need for this field to
                        be unique, although if it isn't you may have strange results.  If this
                        field is left blank, the controlling tty is set to the console.  Also
                        note that if BusyBox detects that a serial console is in use, then only
                        entries whose controlling tty is either the serial console or /dev/null
                        will be run.  BusyBox init does nothing with utmp.  We don't need no
                        stinkin' utmp.

                <runlevels>:

                        The runlevels field is completely ignored.

                <action>:

                        Valid actions include: sysinit, respawn, askfirst, wait,
                        once, restart, ctrlaltdel, and shutdown.

                        The available actions can be classified into two groups: actions
                        that are run only once, and actions that are re-run when the specified
                        process exits.

                        Run only-once actions:

                                'sysinit' is the first item run on boot.  init waits until all
                                sysinit actions are completed before continuing.  Following the
                                completion of all sysinit actions, all 'wait' actions are run.
                                'wait' actions, like  'sysinit' actions, cause init to wait until
                                the specified task completes.  'once' actions are asynchronous,
                                therefore, init does not wait for them to complete.  'restart' is
                                the action taken to restart the init process.  By default this should
                                simply run /sbin/init, but can be a script which runs pivot_root or it
                                can do all sorts of other interesting things.  The 'ctrlaltdel' init
                                actions are run when the system detects that someone on the system
                               console has pressed the CTRL-ALT-DEL key combination.  Typically one
                               wants to run 'reboot' at this point to cause the system to reboot.
                                Finally the 'shutdown' action specifies the actions to taken when
                               init is told to reboot.  Unmounting filesystems and disabling swap
                               is a very good here

                        Run repeatedly actions:

                                'respawn' actions are run after the 'once' actions.  When a process
                                started with a 'respawn' action exits, init automatically restarts
                                it.  Unlike sysvinit, BusyBox init does not stop processes from
                                respawning out of control.  The 'askfirst' actions acts just like
                                respawn, except that before running the specified process it
                                displays the line "Please press Enter to activate this console."
                                and then waits for the user to press enter before starting the
                                specified process.

                        Unrecognized actions (like initdefault) will cause init to emit an
                        error message, and then go along with its business.  All actions are
                        run in the order they appear in /etc/inittab.

                <process>:

                        Specifies the process to be executed and its command line.

    lash
        lash [FILE]... or: sh -c command [args]...

        The BusyBox LAme SHell (command interpreter)

        This command does not yet have proper documentation.

        Use lash just as you would use any other shell. It properly handles
        pipes, redirects, job control, can be used as the shell for scripts,
        and has a sufficient set of builtins to do what is needed. It does
        not (yet) support Bourne Shell syntax. If you need things like
        "if-then-else", "while", and such use ash or bash. If you just need
        a very simple and extremely small shell, this will do the job.

    makedevs
        makedevs [-d device_table] rootdir

        Creates a range of special files as specified in a device table.
        Device table entries take the form of: <type> <mode> <uid> <gid>
        <major> <minor> <start> <inc> <count> Where name is the file name,
        type can be one of:

              f       A regular file
              d       Directory
              c       Character special device file
              b       Block special device file
              p       Fifo (named pipe)
        uid is the user id for the target file, gid is the group id for the
        target file.  The rest of the entries (major, minor, etc) apply to
        to device special files.  A '-' may be used for blank entries.

        Example:

                For example:
                <name>    <type> <mode><uid><gid><major><minor><start><inc><count>
                /dev         d   755    0    0    -      -      -      -    -

                /dev/null    c   666    0    0    1      3      0      0    -
                /dev/zero    c   666    0    0    1      5      0      0    -
                /dev/hda     b   640    0    0    3      0      0      0    -
                /dev/hda     b   640    0    0    3      1      1      1    15
        
                Will Produce:
                /dev
                /dev/console
                /dev/null
                /dev/zero
                /dev/hda
                /dev/hda[0-15]

    md5sum
        md5sum [OPTION] [FILEs...] or: md5sum [OPTION] -c [FILE]

        Print or check MD5 checksums.

        Options: With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

                -c      check MD5 sums against given list

        The following two options are useful only when verifying checksums:

                -s      don't output anything, status code shows success
                -w      warn about improperly formated MD5 checksum lines

        Example:

                $ md5sum < busybox
                6fd11e98b98a58f64ff3398d7b324003
                $ md5sum busybox
                6fd11e98b98a58f64ff3398d7b324003  busybox
                $ md5sum -c -
                6fd11e98b98a58f64ff3398d7b324003  busybox
                busybox: OK
                ^D

    mdev
        mdev [-s]

                -s      Scan /sys and populate /dev during system boot

        Called with no options (via hotplug) it uses environment variables
        to determine which device to add/remove.

        The mdev config file contains lines that look like: hd[a-z][0-9]*
        0:3 660

        That's device name (with regex match), uid:gid, and permissions.

        Optionally, that can be followed (on the same line) by an asterisk
        and a command line to run after creating the corresponding
        device(s), ala:

          hdc root:cdrom 660  *ln -s hdc cdrom

        Config file parsing stops on the first matching line. If no config
        entry is matched, devices are created with default 0:0 660. (Make
        the last line match .* to override this.)

                -p      no error if existing, make parent directories as needed

        Example:

                $ mkdir /tmp/foo
                $ mkdir /tmp/foo
                /tmp/foo: File exists
                $ mkdir /tmp/foo/bar/baz
                /tmp/foo/bar/baz: No such file or directory

        Options:

                -d              Make a directory instead of a file
                -q              Fail silently if an error occurs

    modprobe
        modprobe [-knqrsv] MODULE [symbol=value ...]

        Options:

                -k      Make module autoclean-able
                -n      Just show what would be done
                -q      Quiet output
                -r      Remove module (stacks) or do autoclean
                -s      Report via syslog instead of stderr
                -v      Verbose output

        modprobe can (un)load a stack of modules, passing each module
        options (when loading). modprobe uses a configuration file to
        determine what option(s) to pass each module it loads.

        The configuration file is searched (in order) amongst:

            /etc/modprobe.conf (2.6 only)
            /etc/modules.conf
            /etc/conf.modules (deprecated)

        They all have the same syntax (see below). If none is present, it is
        _not_ an error; each loaded module is then expected to load without
        options. Once a file is found, the others are tested for.

        /etc/modules.conf entry format:

          alias <alias_name> <mod_name>
            Makes it possible to modprobe alias_name, when there is no such module.
            It makes sense if your mod_name is long, or you want a more reprenstative
            name for that module (eg. 'scsi' in place of 'aha7xxx').
            This makes it also possible to use a different set of options (below) for
            the module and the alias.
            A module can be aliased more than once.

          options <mod_name|alias_name> <symbol=value ...>
            When loading module mod_name (or the module aliased by alias_name), pass
            the "symbol=value" pairs as option to that module.

        Sample /etc/modules.conf file:

          options tulip irq=3
          alias tulip tulip2
          options tulip2 irq=4 io=0x308

        Other functionality offered by 'classic' modprobe is not available
        in this implementation.

        If module options are present both in the config file, and on the
        command line, then the options from the command line will be passed
        to the module _after_ the options from the config file. That way,
        you can have defaults in the config file, and override them for a
        specific usage from the command line.

        Example:

                (with the above /etc/modules.conf):
        
                $ modprobe tulip
                   will load the module 'tulip' with default option 'irq=3'
        
                $ modprobe tulip irq=5
                   will load the module 'tulip' with option 'irq=5', thus overriding the default
        
                $ modprobe tulip2
                   will load the module 'tulip' with default options 'irq=4 io=0x308',
                   which are the default for alias 'tulip2'
        
                $ modprobe tulip2 irq=8
                   will load the module 'tulip' with default options 'irq=4 io=0x308 irq=8',
                   which are the default for alias 'tulip2' overriden by the option 'irq=8'
        
                   from the command line
        
                $ modprobe tulip2 irq=2 io=0x210
                   will load the module 'tulip' with default options 'irq=4 io=0x308 irq=4 io=0x210',
                   which are the default for alias 'tulip2' overriden by the options 'irq=2 io=0x210'
        
                   from the command line

        Options for use with the "-o" flag:

                async/sync:     Writes are asynchronous / synchronous
                atime/noatime:  Enable / disable updates to inode access times
                dev/nodev:      Allow use of special device files / disallow them

LIBC NSS
    GNU Libc (glibc) uses the Name Service Switch (NSS) to configure the
    behavior of the C library for the local environment, and to configure
    how it reads system data, such as passwords and group information. This
    is implemented using an /etc/nsswitch.conf configuration file, and using
    one or more of the /lib/libnss_* libraries. BusyBox tries to avoid using
    any libc calls that make use of NSS. Some applets however, such as login
    and su, will use libc functions that require NSS.

    If you enable CONFIG_USE_BB_PWD_GRP, BusyBox will use internal functions
    to directly access the /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/shadow files
    without using NSS. This may allow you to run your system without the
    need for installing any of the NSS configuration files and libraries.

    When used with glibc, the BusyBox 'networking' applets will similarly
    require that you install at least some of the glibc NSS stuff (in
    particular, /etc/nsswitch.conf, /lib/libnss_dns*, /lib/libnss_files*,
    and /lib/libresolv*).

    Shameless Plug: As an alternative, one could use a C library such as
    uClibc. In addition to making your system significantly smaller, uClibc
    does not require the use of any NSS support files or libraries.
