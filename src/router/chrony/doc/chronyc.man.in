chronyc \- command\-line interface for chrony daemon
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBchronyc\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]... [\fICOMMAND\fP]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBchronyc\fP is a command\-line interface program which can be used to monitor
\fBchronyd\fP\*(Aqs performance and to change various operating parameters whilst it is
running.
.sp
If no commands are specified on the command line, \fBchronyc\fP will expect input
from the user. The prompt \fIchronyc>\fP will be displayed when it is being run
from a terminal. If \fBchronyc\fP\*(Aqs input or output are redirected from or to a file,
the prompt will not be shown.
.sp
There are two ways \fBchronyc\fP can access \fBchronyd\fP. One is the Internet
Protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) and the other is a Unix domain socket, which is
accessible locally by the root or \fIchrony\fP user. By default, \fBchronyc\fP first
tries to connect to the Unix domain socket. The compiled\-in default path is
\fI@CHRONYRUNDIR@/chronyd.sock\fP. If that fails (e.g. because \fBchronyc\fP is
running under a non\-root user), it will try to connect to 127.0.0.1 and then
::1.
.sp
Only the following monitoring commands, which do not affect the behaviour of
\fBchronyd\fP, are allowed from the network by default: \fBactivity\fP, \fBmanual list\fP,
\fBrtcdata\fP, \fBsmoothing\fP, \fBsourcename\fP, \fBsources\fP, \fBsourcestats\fP, \fBtracking\fP,
\fBwaitsync\fP. The
set of hosts from which \fBchronyd\fP will accept these commands can be configured
with the \fBcmdallow\fP directive in the \fBchronyd\fP\*(Aqs
configuration file or the \fBcmdallow\fP command in \fBchronyc\fP. By
default, the commands are accepted only from localhost (127.0.0.1 or ::1).
.sp
Other monitoring commands can be enabled for network access by the
\fBopencommands\fP directive. Monitoring commands
with disabled network access and commands that affect the behaviour of
\fBchronyd\fP are allowed only through the Unix domain socket. If they are sent
over the network, \fBchronyd\fP will respond with a \(oqNot authorised\(cq error, even
if it is from localhost.
.sp
Having full access to \fBchronyd\fP via \fBchronyc\fP is more or less equivalent to
being able to modify the \fBchronyd\fP\*(Aqs configuration file and restart it.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-4\fP
.RS 4
With this option hostnames will be resolved only to IPv4 addresses.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-6\fP
.RS 4
With this option hostnames will be resolved only to IPv6 addresses.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-n\fP
.RS 4
This option disables resolving of IP addresses to hostnames, e.g. to avoid slow
DNS lookups. Long addresses will not be truncated to fit into the column.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-N\fP
.RS 4
This option enables printing of original hostnames or IP addresses of NTP
sources that were specified in the configuration file, or \fBchronyc\fP commands.
Without the \fB\-n\fP and \fB\-N\fP option, the printed hostnames are obtained from
reverse DNS lookups and can be different from the specified hostnames.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-c\fP
.RS 4
This option enables printing of reports in a comma\-separated values (CSV)
format. Reverse DNS lookups will be disabled, time will be printed as number of
seconds since the epoch, and values in seconds will not be converted to other
units.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-e\fP
.RS 4
With this option each \fBchronyc\fP response will end with a line containing a
single dot.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d\fP
.RS 4
This option enables printing of debugging messages if \fBchronyc\fP was compiled
with debugging support.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-m\fP
.RS 4
Normally, all arguments on the command line are interpreted as one command.
With this option multiple commands can be specified. Each argument will be
interpreted as a whole command.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fP \fIhost\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies the host to be contacted by \fBchronyc\fP. It can be
specified with a hostname, IP address, or path to the local Unix domain socket.
Multiple values can be specified as a comma\-separated list to provide a
fallback.
.sp
The default value is \fI@CHRONYRUNDIR@/chronyd.sock,127.0.0.1,::1\fP, i.e. the host
where \fBchronyc\fP is being run. First, it tries to connect to the Unix domain
socket and if that fails (e.g. due to running under a non\-root user), it
will try to connect to 127.0.0.1 and then ::1.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p\fP \fIport\fP
.RS 4
This option allows the user to specify the UDP port number which the target
\fBchronyd\fP is using for its monitoring connections. This defaults to 323; there
would rarely be a need to change this.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-f\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
This option is ignored and is provided only for compatibility.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-a\fP
.RS 4
This option is ignored and is provided only for compatibility.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
.RS 4
With this option \fBchronyc\fP displays its version number on the terminal and
exits.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
With this option \fBchronyc\fP displays a help message on the terminal and
exits.
.RE
.SH "COMMANDS"
.sp
This section describes each of the commands available within the \fBchronyc\fP
program.
.SS "System clock"
.sp
\fBtracking\fP
.RS 4
The \fBtracking\fP command displays parameters about the system\(cqs clock
performance. An example of the output is shown below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4

.fam

.if n .RE
.sp
The fields are explained as follows:
.sp
\fBReference ID\fP
.RS 4
This is the reference ID and name (or IP address) of the server to which the
computer is currently synchronised. For IPv4 addresses, the reference ID is
equal to the address and for IPv6 addresses it is the first 32 bits of the MD5
sum of the address.
.sp
If the reference ID is \fI7F7F0101\fP and there is no name or IP address, it means
the computer is not synchronised to any external source and that you have the
\fIlocal\fP mode operating (via the \fBlocal\fP command in \fBchronyc\fP, or the
\fBlocal\fP directive in the configuration file).
.sp
The reference ID is printed as a hexadecimal number. Note that in older
versions it used to be printed in quad\-dotted notation and could be confused
with an IPv4 address.
.RE
.sp
\fBStratum\fP
.RS 4
The stratum indicates how many hops away from a computer with an attached
reference clock we are. Such a computer is a stratum\-1 computer, so the
computer in the example is two hops away (i.e. \fIntp1.example.net\fP is a
stratum\-2 and is synchronised from a stratum\-1).
.RE
.sp
\fBRef time\fP
.RS 4
This is the time (UTC) at which the last measurement from the reference
source was processed.
.RE
.sp
\fBSystem time\fP
.RS 4
This is the current offset between the NTP clock and system clock. The NTP
clock is a software (virtual) clock maintained by \fBchronyd\fP, which is
synchronised to the configured time sources and provides time to NTP clients.
The system clock is synchronised to the NTP clock. To avoid steps in the
system time, which might have adverse consequences for certain applications,
the system clock is normally corrected only by speeding up or slowing down (up
to the rate configured by the \fBmaxslewrate\fP
directive). If the offset is too large, this correction will take a very long
time. A step can be forced by the \fBmakestep\fP command, or the
\fBmakestep\fP directive in the configuration file.
.sp
Note that all other offsets reported by \fBchronyc\fP and most offsets in the log
files are relative to the NTP clock, not the system clock.
.RE
.sp
\fBLast offset\fP
.RS 4
This is the estimated local offset on the last clock update. A positive value
indicates the local time (as previously estimated true time) was ahead of the
time sources.
.RE
.sp
\fBRMS offset\fP
.RS 4
This is a long\-term average of the offset value.
.RE
.sp
\fBFrequency\fP
.RS 4
The \(oqfrequency\(cq is the rate by which the system\(cqs clock would be wrong if
\fBchronyd\fP was not correcting it. It is expressed in ppm (parts per million).
For example, a value of 1 ppm would mean that when the system\(cqs clock thinks it
has advanced 1 second, it has actually advanced by 1.000001 seconds relative to
true time.
.RE
.sp
\fBResidual freq\fP
.RS 4
This shows the \(oqresidual frequency\(cq for the currently selected reference
source. This reflects any difference between what the measurements from the
reference source indicate the frequency should be and the frequency currently
being used.
.sp
The reason this is not always zero is that a smoothing procedure is
applied to the frequency. Each time a measurement from the reference
source is obtained and a new residual frequency computed, the estimated
accuracy of this residual is compared with the estimated accuracy (see
\(oqskew\(cq next) of the existing frequency value. A weighted average is
computed for the new frequency, with weights depending on these accuracies.
If the measurements from the reference source follow a consistent trend, the
residual will be driven to zero over time.
.RE
.sp
\fBSkew\fP
.RS 4
This is the estimated error bound on the frequency.
.RE
.sp
\fBRoot delay\fP
.RS 4
This is the total of the network path delays to the stratum\-1 computer from
which the computer is ultimately synchronised.
.RE
.sp
\fBRoot dispersion\fP
.RS 4
This is the total dispersion accumulated through all the computers back to
the stratum\-1 computer from which the computer is ultimately synchronised.
Dispersion is due to system clock resolution, statistical measurement
variations, etc.
.sp
An absolute bound on the computer\(cqs clock accuracy (assuming the stratum\-1
computer is correct) is given by:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
clock_error <= |system_time_offset| + root_dispersion + (0.5 * root_delay)
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.RE
.sp
\fBUpdate interval\fP
.RS 4
This is the interval between the last two clock updates.
.RE
.sp
\fBLeap status\fP
.RS 4
This is the leap status, which can be \fINormal\fP, \fIInsert second\fP, \fIDelete
second\fP or \fINot synchronised\fP.
.RE
.RE
.sp
\fBmakestep\fP, \fBmakestep\fP \fIthreshold\fP \fIlimit\fP
.RS 4
Normally \fBchronyd\fP will cause the system to gradually correct any time offset,
by slowing down or speeding up the clock as required. In certain situations,
the system clock might be so far adrift that this slewing process would take a
very long time to correct the system clock.
.sp
The \fBmakestep\fP command can be used in this situation. There are two forms of
the command. The first form has no parameters. It tells \fBchronyd\fP to cancel any
remaining correction that was being slewed and jump the system clock by the
equivalent amount, making it correct immediately.
.sp
The second form configures the automatic stepping, similarly to the
\fBmakestep\fP directive. It has two parameters,
stepping threshold (in seconds) and number of future clock updates for which
the threshold will be active. This can be used with the \fBburst\fP
command to quickly make a new measurement and correct the clock by stepping if
needed, without waiting for \fBchronyd\fP to complete the measurement and update
the clock.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
makestep 0.1 1
burst 1/2
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
BE WARNED: Certain software will be seriously affected by such jumps in the
system time. (That is the reason why \fBchronyd\fP uses slewing normally.)
.RE
.sp
\fBmaxupdateskew\fP \fIskew\-in\-ppm\fP
.RS 4
This command has the same effect as the
\fBmaxupdateskew\fP directive in the
configuration file.
.RE
.sp
\fBwaitsync\fP [\fImax\-tries\fP [\fImax\-correction\fP [\fImax\-skew\fP [\fIinterval\fP]]]]
.RS 4
The \fBwaitsync\fP command waits for \fBchronyd\fP to synchronise.
.sp
Up to four optional arguments can be specified. The first is the maximum number
of tries before giving up and returning a non\-zero error code. When 0 is
specified, or there are no arguments, the number of tries will not be limited.
.sp
The second and third arguments are the maximum allowed remaining correction of
the system clock and the maximum allowed skew (in ppm) as reported by the
\fBtracking\fP command in the \fBSystem time\fP and \fBSkew\fP fields. If not
specified or zero, the value will not be checked.
.sp
The fourth argument is the interval specified in seconds in which the check is
repeated. The interval is 10 seconds by default.
.sp
An example is:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
waitsync 60 0.01
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
which will wait up to about 10 minutes (60 times 10 seconds) for \fBchronyd\fP to
synchronise to a source and the remaining correction to be less than 10
milliseconds.
.RE
.SS "Time sources"
.sp
\fBsources\fP [\fB\-a\fP] [\fB\-v\fP]
.RS 4
This command displays information about the current time sources that \fBchronyd\fP
is accessing.
.sp
If the \fB\-a\fP option is specified, all sources are displayed, including those that
do not have a known address yet. Such sources have an identifier in the format
\fIID#XXXXXXXXXX\fP, which can be used in other commands expecting a source address.
.sp
The \fB\-v\fP option enables a verbose output. In this case,
extra caption lines are shown as a reminder of the meanings of the columns.

This shows the stratum of the source, as reported in its most recently
received sample. Stratum 1 indicates a computer with a locally attached
reference clock. A computer that is synchronised to a stratum 1 computer is
at stratum 2. A computer that is synchronised to a stratum 2 computer is at
stratum 3, and so on.
.RE
.sp
\fBPoll\fP
.RS 4
This shows the rate at which the source is being polled, as a base\-2
logarithm of the interval in seconds. Thus, a value of 6 would indicate that
a measurement is being made every 64 seconds. \fBchronyd\fP automatically varies
the polling rate in response to prevailing conditions.
.RE
.sp
\fBReach\fP
.RS 4
This shows the source\(cqs reachability register printed as an octal number. The
register has 8 bits. It is shifted to left by one bit with each poll and it is
updated by 1 when a valid NTP response, or just a sample in case of a reference
clock, is received from the source. A value of 377 indicates that a valid
response or sample was received for all of the last 8 polls. Note that samples
can be dropped if they are not considered good enough for synchronisation, but
the reachability register will still have 1s for their polls.
.RE
.sp
\fBLastRx\fP
.RS 4
This column shows how long ago the last good sample (which is shown in the next
column) was received from the source. Measurements that failed some tests are
ignored. This is normally in seconds. The letters \fIm\fP, \fIh\fP, \fId\fP or \fIy\fP indicate
minutes, hours, days, or years.
.RE
.sp
\fBLast sample\fP
.RS 4
This column shows the offset between the local clock and the source at the
last measurement. The number in the square brackets shows the actual measured
offset. This can be suffixed by \fIns\fP (indicating nanoseconds), \fIus\fP
(indicating microseconds), \fIms\fP (indicating milliseconds), or \fIs\fP (indicating
seconds). The number to the left of the square brackets shows the original
measurement, adjusted to allow for any slews applied to the local clock
since. Positive offsets indicate that the local clock is ahead of the source.
The number following the \fI+/\-\fP indicator shows the margin of error in the
measurement (NTP root distance).

\fBoffline\fP [\fIaddress\fP], \fBoffline\fP [\fImasked\-address\fP/\fImasked\-bits\fP], \fBoffline\fP [\fImask\fP/\fImasked\-address\fP]
.RS 4
The \fBoffline\fP command is used to warn \fBchronyd\fP that the network connection to
a particular host or hosts is about to be lost, e.g. on computers with
intermittent connection to their time sources.
.sp
Another case where \fBoffline\fP could be used is where a computer serves time to a
local group of computers, and has a permanent connection to true time servers
outside the organisation. However, the external connection is heavily loaded at
certain times of the day and the measurements obtained are less reliable at
those times. In this case, it is probably most useful to determine the
gain or loss rate during the quiet periods and let the whole network coast through
the loaded periods. The \fBoffline\fP and \fBonline\fP commands can be used to achieve
this.
.sp
There are four forms of the \fBoffline\fP command. The first form is a wildcard,
meaning all sources (including sources that do not have a known address yet).
The second form allows an IP address mask and a masked
address to be specified. The third form uses CIDR notation. The fourth form
uses an IP address or a hostname. These forms are illustrated below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4

offline 2001:db8:789a::/48
offline ntp1.example.net
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The second form means that the \fBoffline\fP command is to be applied to any source
whose IPv4 address is in the \fI1.2.3\fP subnet. (The host\(cqs address is logically
and\-ed with the mask, and if the result matches the \fImasked\-address\fP the host
is processed.) The third form means that the command is to be applied to all
sources whose IPv6 addresses have their first 48 bits equal to \fI2001:db8:789a\fP. The
fourth form means that the command is to be applied only to that one source.
.sp
The wildcard form of the address is equivalent to:

The \fBonline\fP command is opposite in function to the \fBoffline\fP

\fBrefresh\fP

The \fBrefresh\fP command can be used to force \fBchronyd\fP to resolve the names of

.sp
Sources that stop responding are replaced with newly resolved addresses
automatically after 8 polling intervals. This command can be used to replace
them immediately, e.g. after suspending and resuming the machine in a different
network.
.sp
Note that with pools which have more than 16 addresses, or not all IPv4 or IPv6
addresses are included in a single DNS response (e.g. pool.ntp.org), this
command might replace the addresses even if they are still in the pool.

\fBsettime\fP \fItime\fP

The \fBsettime\fP command allows the current time to be entered manually, if this

the \fBmanual\fP directive in the configuration file,
or with the \fBmanual\fP command of \fBchronyc\fP.)
.sp
It should be noted that the computer\(cqs sense of time will only be as accurate
as the reference you use for providing this input (e.g. your watch), as well as
how well you can time the press of the return key.
.sp
Providing your computer\(cqs time zone is set up properly, you will be able to
enter a local time (rather than UTC).
.sp
The response to a successful \fBsettime\fP command indicates the amount that the
computer\(cqs clock was wrong. It should be apparent from this if you have entered
the time wrongly, e.g. with the wrong time zone.
.sp
The rate of drift of the system clock is estimated by a regression process
using the entered measurement and all previous measurements entered during the
present run of \fBchronyd\fP. However, the entered measurement is used for
adjusting the current clock offset (rather than the estimated intercept from
the regression, which is ignored). Contrast what happens with the
\fBmanual delete\fP command, where the intercept is used to set the
current offset (since there is no measurement that has just been entered in
that case).
.sp
The time is parsed by the public domain \fIgetdate\fP algorithm. Consequently, you
can only specify time to the nearest second.

This is the number of previous measurements being used to determine the RTC
gain or loss rate.

\fBNumber of runs\fP
.RS 4
This is the number of runs of residuals of the same sign following the

indicates that the measurements are not well approximated by a linear model,
and that the algorithm will tend to delete the older measurements to improve
the fit.
.RE

\fBSample span period\fP
.RS 4
This is the period that the measurements span (from the oldest to the

\fIh\fP for hours, \fId\fP for days or \fIy\fP for years can be used.
.RE

\fBRTC is fast by\fP
.RS 4
This is the estimate of how many seconds fast the RTC when it thought
the time was at the reference time (above). If this value is large, you
might (or might not) want to use the \fBtrimrtc\fP command to bring the
RTC into line with the system clock. (Note, a large error will not affect
\fBchronyd\fP\*(Aqs operation, unless it becomes so big as to start causing rounding
errors.)
.RE
.sp
\fBRTC gains time at\fP
.RS 4
This is the amount of time gained (positive) or lost (negative) by the real
time clock for each second that it ticks. It is measured in parts per
million. So if the value shown was +1, suppose the RTC was exactly right when
it crosses a particular second boundary. Then it would be 1 microsecond fast
when it crosses its next second boundary.
.RE

\fBtrimrtc\fP

The \fBtrimrtc\fP command is used to correct the system\(cqs real\-time clock (RTC) to
the main system clock. It has no effect if the error between the two clocks is
currently estimated at less than a second.
.sp
The command takes no arguments. It performs the following steps (if the RTC is
more than 1 second away from the system clock):
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c

.sp
The last step is done as a precaution against the computer suffering a power
failure before either the daemon exits or the \fBwritertc\fP command
is issued.
.sp
\fBchronyd\fP will still work perfectly well both whilst operating and across
machine reboots even if the \fBtrimrtc\fP command is never used (and the RTC is
allowed to drift away from true time). The \fBtrimrtc\fP command is provided as a
method by which it can be corrected, in a manner compatible with \fBchronyd\fP
using it to maintain accurate time across machine reboots.
.sp
The \fBtrimrtc\fP command can be executed automatically by \fBchronyd\fP with the
\fBrtcautotrim\fP directive in the configuration
file.
.RE
.sp
\fBwritertc\fP
.RS 4
The \fBwritertc\fP command writes the currently estimated error and gain or loss rate
parameters for the RTC to the RTC file (specified with the
\fBrtcfile\fP directive). This information is also
written automatically when \fBchronyd\fP is killed (by the SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT
or SIGTERM signals) or when the \fBtrimrtc\fP command is issued.
.RE
.SS "Other daemon commands"
.sp
\fBcyclelogs\fP
.RS 4
The \fBcyclelogs\fP command causes all of \fBchronyd\fP\*(Aqs open log files to be closed
and re\-opened. This allows them to be renamed so that they can be periodically
purged. An example of how to do this is shown below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
# mv /var/log/chrony/measurements.log /var/log/chrony/measurements1.log
# chronyc cyclelogs
# rm /var/log/chrony/measurements1.log
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Note that log files enabled by the \fBlog\fP directive are opened when the first
entry is made. The message log file specified by the \fBchronyd\fP\*(Aqs \fB\-l\fP option is
opened early on start and closed on the \fBcyclelogs\fP command only if opening of
the new file succeeds to avoid losing messages. If \fBchronyd\fP is configured to
drop root privileges and the directory containing the log file is not writable
for the specified user, \fBchronyd\fP will not be able to open the file again.
.RE
.sp
\fBdump\fP
.RS 4
The \fBdump\fP command causes \fBchronyd\fP to write its current history of
measurements for each of its sources to dump files in the directory specified
in the configuration file by the \fBdumpdir\fP
directive and also write server NTS keys and client NTS cookies to the
directory specified by the \fBntsdumpdir\fP
directive. Note that \fBchronyd\fP does this automatically when it exits. This
command is mainly useful for inspection whilst \fBchronyd\fP is running.
.RE
.sp
\fBrekey\fP
.RS 4
The \fBrekey\fP command causes \fBchronyd\fP to re\-read the key file specified in the
configuration file by the \fBkeyfile\fP directive. It
also re\-reads the server NTS keys if
\fBntsdumpdir\fP is specified and
automatic rotation is disabled in the
configuration file.
.RE
.sp
\fBreset\fP \fBsources\fP
.RS 4
The \fBreset sources\fP command causes \fBchronyd\fP to drop all measurements and
switch to the unsynchronised state. This command can help \fBchronyd\fP with
recovery when the measurements are known to be no longer valid or accurate,
e.g. due to moving the computer to a different network, or resuming the
computer from a low\-power state (which resets the system clock). \fBchronyd\fP will
drop the measurements automatically when it detects the clock has made an
unexpected jump, but the detection is not completely reliable.

\fBkeygen\fP [\fIid\fP [\fItype\fP [\fIbits\fP]]]
.RS 4
The \fBkeygen\fP command generates a key that can be added to the
key file (specified with the \fBkeyfile\fP directive)
to allow NTP authentication between server and client, or peers. The key is
generated from the \fI/dev/urandom\fP device and it is printed to standard output.
.sp
The command has three optional arguments. The first argument is the key number
(by default 1), which will be specified with the \fBkey\fP option of the \fBserver\fP
or \fBpeer\fP directives in the configuration file. The second argument is the name
of the hash function or cipher (by default SHA1, or MD5 if SHA1 is not
available). The third argument is the length of the key in bits if a hash
function was selected, between 80 and 4096 bits (by default 160 bits).
.sp
An example is:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
keygen 73 SHA1 256
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
which generates a 256\-bit SHA1 key with number 73. The printed line should
then be securely transferred and added to the key files on both server and
client, or peers. A different key should be generated for each client or peer.
