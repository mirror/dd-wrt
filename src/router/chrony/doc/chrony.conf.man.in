\fBchrony.conf\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This file configures the \fBchronyd\fP daemon. The compiled\-in location is
\fI@SYSCONFDIR@/chrony.conf\fP. Other locations can be specified on the
\fBchronyd\fP command line with the \fB\-f\fP option.
.sp
Each directive in the configuration file is placed on a separate line. The
following sections describe each of the directives in turn. The directives are
not case\-sensitive. Generally, the directives can occur in any order in the file
and if a directive is specified multiple times, only the last one will be
effective. Exceptions are noted in the descriptions.
.sp
The configuration directives can also be specified directly on the \fBchronyd\fP
command line. In this case each argument is parsed as a new line and the
configuration file is ignored.
.sp
While the number of supported directives is large, only a few of them are
typically needed. See the \fBEXAMPLES\fP section for configuration in
typical operating scenarios.
.sp
The configuration file might contain comment lines. A comment line is any line
that starts with zero or more spaces followed by any one of the following
characters: \fB!\fP, \fB;\fP, \fB#\fP, \fB%\fP. Any line with this format will be ignored.

.sp
\fBserver\fP \fIhostname\fP [\fIoption\fP]...
.RS 4
The \fBserver\fP directive specifies an NTP server which can be used as a time
source. The client\-server relationship is strictly hierarchical: a client might
synchronise its system time to that of the server, but the server\(cqs system time
will never be influenced by that of a client.
.sp
The server can be specified by its hostname or IP address. If the hostname cannot
be resolved on start, \fBchronyd\fP will try it again in increasing intervals, and
also when the \fBonline\fP command is issued in \fBchronyc\fP.
.sp
The DNS record can change over time. The used address will be replaced with a
newly resolved address when the server becomes unreachable (i.e. no valid
response to the last 8 requests), unsynchronised, a falseticker (i.e. does not
agree with a majority of other sources), or the root distance is too large (the
limit can be configured by the \fBmaxdistance\fP directive). The
automatic replacement happens at most once per 30 minutes and only one
server can be replaced at a time. The address is also refreshed periodically
when the server is working normally (the interval can be configured by the
\fBrefresh\fP directive).
.sp
This directive can be used multiple times to specify multiple servers. Each
server must have a different IP address to be usable by \fBchronyd\fP. If a server
is specified by a hostname that resolves only to addresses already used by
other servers, the server will be treated as having an unknown address (e.g.
reported by the \fBchronyc\fP \fBactivity\fP command).
.sp
The directive supports the following options:
.sp
\fBminpoll\fP \fIpoll\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies the minimum interval between requests sent to the server
as a power of 2 in seconds. For example, \fBminpoll 5\fP would mean that the
polling interval should not drop below 32 seconds. The default is 6 (64
seconds), the minimum is \-7 (1/128th of a second), and the maximum is 24 (6
months). Note that intervals shorter than 6 (64 seconds) should generally not
be used with public servers on the Internet, because it might be considered
abuse. A sub\-second interval will be enabled only when the server is reachable
and the round\-trip delay is shorter than 10 milliseconds, i.e. the server
should be in a local network.
.RE
.sp
\fBmaxpoll\fP \fIpoll\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies the maximum interval between requests sent to the server
as a power of 2 in seconds. For example, \fBmaxpoll 9\fP indicates that the polling
interval should stay at or below 9 (512 seconds). The default is 10 (1024
seconds), the minimum is \-7 (1/128th of a second), and the maximum is 24 (6
months).
.RE
.sp
\fBiburst\fP
.RS 4
With this option, \fBchronyd\fP will start with a burst of 4\-8 requests in order to
make the first update of the clock sooner. It will also repeat the burst every
time the source is switched from the offline state to online with the
\fBonline\fP command in \fBchronyc\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fBburst\fP
.RS 4
With this option, \fBchronyd\fP will send a burst of up to 4 requests when it
cannot get a good measurement from the
server. The number of requests in the burst is limited by the current polling
interval to keep the average interval at or above the minimum interval, i.e.
the current interval needs to be at least two times longer than the minimum
interval in order to allow a burst with two requests.
.RE
.sp
\fBkey\fP \fIID\fP
.RS 4
The NTP protocol supports a message authentication code (MAC) to prevent
computers from having their system time upset by rogue packets being sent to them.
The MAC is generated as a function of a key specified in the key file,
which is specified by the \fBkeyfile\fP directive.
.sp
The \fBkey\fP option specifies which key (with an ID in the range 1 through 2^32\-1)
\fBchronyd\fP should use to authenticate requests sent to the server and verify its
responses. The server must have the same key for this number configured;
otherwise no relationship between the computers will be possible.
.sp
If the server is running \fBntpd\fP and the output size of the hash function used
by the key is longer than 160 bits (e.g. SHA256), the \fBversion\fP option needs to
be set to 4 for compatibility.
.RE
.sp
\fBnts\fP
.RS 4
This option enables authentication using the Network Time Security (NTS)
mechanism. Unlike with the \fBkey\fP option, the server and client do not need to
share a key in a key file. NTS has a Key Establishment (NTS\-KE) protocol using
the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to get the keys and cookies
required by NTS for authentication of NTP packets.
.sp
With this option, the hostname specified in the server or pool directive is the
NTS\-KE server or pool of NTS\-KE servers, respectively. The NTP server usually
runs on the same host, but it can be separated from the NTS\-KE server (the
hostname or address of the NTP server is provided to the client by the NTS\-KE
server).
.sp
The NTS\-KE server can be specified by IP address if it is included in the
server\(cqs certificate as a Subject Alternative Name (SAN).
.RE
.sp
\fBcertset\fP \fIID\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies which set of trusted certificates should be used to verify
the server\(cqs certificate when the \fBnts\fP option is enabled. Sets of certificates
can be specified with the \fBntstrustedcerts\fP directive. The
default set is 0, which by default contains certificates of the system\(cqs
default trusted certificate authorities.
.RE
.sp
\fBmaxdelay\fP \fIdelay\fP
.RS 4
\fBchronyd\fP uses the network round\-trip delay to the server to determine how
accurate a particular measurement is likely to be. Long round\-trip delays
indicate that the request, or the response, or both were delayed. If only one
of the messages was delayed, the measurement error is likely to be substantial.
.sp
For small variations in the round\-trip delay, \fBchronyd\fP uses a weighting scheme
when processing the measurements. Beyond a certain level of delay, however, the
measurements are likely to be so corrupted as to be useless. (This is
particularly so on wireless networks and other slow links, where a long delay
probably indicates a highly asymmetric delay caused by the response waiting
behind a lot of packets related to a download of some sort).
.sp
If the user knows that round trip delays above a certain level should cause the
measurement to be ignored, this level can be defined with the \fBmaxdelay\fP
option. For example, \fBmaxdelay 0.3\fP would indicate that measurements with a
round\-trip delay greater than 0.3 seconds should be ignored. The default value
is 3 seconds, and the maximum value is 1000 seconds.
.RE
.sp
\fBmaxdelayratio\fP \fIratio\fP
.RS 4
This option is similar to the \fBmaxdelay\fP option above. \fBchronyd\fP keeps a record
of the minimum round\-trip delay amongst the previous measurements that it has
buffered. If a measurement has a round\-trip delay that is greater than the
specified ratio times the minimum delay, it will be rejected. By default, this
test is disabled.
.RE
.sp
\fBmaxdelaydevratio\fP \fIratio\fP
.RS 4
If a measurement has a ratio of the increase in the round\-trip delay from the
minimum delay amongst the previous measurements to the standard deviation of
the previous measurements that is greater than the specified ratio, it will be
rejected. The default is 10.0.
.RE
.sp
\fBmaxdelayquant\fP \fIp\fP
.RS 4
This option disables the \fBmaxdelaydevratio\fP test and specifies the maximum
acceptable delay as a quantile of the round\-trip delay instead of a function of
the minimum delay amongst the buffered measurements. If a measurement has a
round\-trip delay that is greater than a long\-term estimate of the \fIp\fP\-quantile,
it will be rejected.
.sp
The specified \fIp\fP value should be between 0.05 and 0.95. For example,
\fBmaxdelayquant 0.2\fP would indicate that only measurements with the lowest 20
percent of round\-trip delays should be accepted. Note that it can take many
measurements for the estimated quantile to reach the expected value. This
option is intended for synchronisation in mostly static local networks with
very short polling intervals and possibly combined with the \fBfilter\fP option.
By default, this test is disabled in favour of the \fBmaxdelaydevratio\fP test.
.RE
.sp
\fBmindelay\fP \fIdelay\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies a fixed minimum round\-trip delay to be used instead of
the minimum amongst the previous measurements. This can be useful in networks
with static configuration to improve the stability of corrections for
asymmetric jitter, weighting of the measurements, and the \fBmaxdelayratio\fP and
\fBmaxdelaydevratio\fP tests. The value should be set accurately in order to have a
positive effect on the synchronisation.
.RE
.sp
\fBasymmetry\fP \fIratio\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies the asymmetry of the network jitter on the path to the
source, which is used to correct the measured offset according to the delay.
The asymmetry can be between \-0.5 and +0.5. A negative value means the delay of
packets sent to the source is more variable than the delay of packets sent from
the source back. By default, \fBchronyd\fP estimates the asymmetry automatically.
.RE
.sp
\fBoffset\fP \fIoffset\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies a correction (in seconds) that will be applied to
offsets measured with this source. It\(cqs particularly useful to compensate for a
known asymmetry in network delay or timestamping errors. For example, if
packets sent to the source were on average delayed by 100 microseconds more
than packets sent from the source back, the correction would be \-0.00005 (\-50
microseconds). The default is 0.0.
.RE
.sp
\fBminsamples\fP \fIsamples\fP
.RS 4
Set the minimum number of samples kept for this source. This overrides the
\fBminsamples\fP directive.
.RE
.sp
\fBmaxsamples\fP \fIsamples\fP
.RS 4
Set the maximum number of samples kept for this source. This overrides the
\fBmaxsamples\fP directive.
.RE
.sp
\fBfilter\fP \fIpolls\fP
.RS 4
This option enables a median filter to reduce noise in NTP measurements. The
filter will process samples collected in the specified number of polls
into a single sample. It is intended to be used with very short polling
intervals in local networks where it is acceptable to generate a lot of NTP
traffic.
.RE
.sp
\fBoffline\fP
.RS 4
If the server will not be reachable when \fBchronyd\fP is started, the \fBoffline\fP
option can be specified. \fBchronyd\fP will not try to poll the server until it is
enabled to do so (by using the \fBonline\fP command in
\fBchronyc\fP).
.RE
.sp
\fBauto_offline\fP
.RS 4
With this option, the server will be assumed to have gone offline when sending
a request fails, e.g. due to a missing route to the network. This option avoids
the need to run the \fBoffline\fP command from \fBchronyc\fP
when disconnecting the network link. (It will still be necessary to use the
\fBonline\fP command when the link has been established, to
enable measurements to start.)
.RE
.sp
\fBprefer\fP
.RS 4
Prefer this source over other selectable sources without the \fBprefer\fP option.
.RE
.sp
\fBnoselect\fP
.RS 4
Never select this source. This is particularly useful for monitoring.
.RE
.sp
\fBtrust\fP
.RS 4
Assume time from this source is always true. It can be rejected as a
falseticker in the source selection only if another source with this option
does not agree with it.
.RE
.sp
\fBrequire\fP
.RS 4
Require that at least one of the sources specified with this option is
selectable (i.e. recently reachable and not a falseticker) before updating the
clock. Together with the \fBtrust\fP option this might be useful to allow a trusted
authenticated source to be safely combined with unauthenticated sources in
order to improve the accuracy of the clock. They can be selected and used for
synchronisation only if they agree with the trusted and required source.
.RE
.sp
\fBxleave\fP
.RS 4
This option enables the interleaved mode of NTP (RFC 9769). It enables the
server to respond with more accurate transmit timestamps (e.g. kernel or
hardware timestamps), which cannot be contained in the transmitted packet
itself and need to refer to a previous packet instead. This can significantly
improve the accuracy and stability of the measurements.
.sp
The interleaved mode is compatible with servers that support only the basic
mode. Note that even
servers that support the interleaved mode might respond in the basic mode as
the interleaved mode requires the servers to keep some state for each client
and the state might be dropped when there are too many clients (e.g.
\fBclientloglimit\fP is too small), or it might be overwritten
by other clients that have the same IP address (e.g. computers behind NAT or
someone sending requests with a spoofed source address).
.sp
The \fBxleave\fP option can be combined with the \fBpresend\fP option in order to
shorten the interval in which the server has to keep the state to be able to
respond in the interleaved mode.
.RE
.sp
\fBpolltarget\fP \fItarget\fP
.RS 4
Target number of measurements to use for the regression algorithm which
\fBchronyd\fP will try to maintain by adjusting the polling interval between
\fBminpoll\fP and \fBmaxpoll\fP. A higher target makes \fBchronyd\fP prefer shorter polling
intervals. The default is 8 and a useful range is from 6 to 60.
.RE
.sp
\fBport\fP \fIport\fP
.RS 4
This option allows the UDP port on which the server understands NTP requests to
be specified. For normal servers this option should not be required (the
default is 123, the standard NTP port).
.RE
.sp
\fBntsport\fP \fIport\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies the TCP port on which the server is listening for NTS\-KE
connections when the \fBnts\fP option is enabled. The default is 4460.
.RE
.sp
\fBpresend\fP \fIpoll\fP
.RS 4
If the timing measurements being made by \fBchronyd\fP are the only network data
passing between two computers, you might find that some measurements are badly
skewed due to either the client or the server having to do an ARP lookup on the
other party prior to transmitting a packet. This is more of a problem with long
sampling intervals, which might be similar in duration to the lifetime of entries
in the ARP caches of the machines.
.sp
In order to avoid this problem, the \fBpresend\fP option can be used. It takes a
single integer argument, which is the smallest polling interval for which an
extra pair of NTP packets will be exchanged between the client and the server
prior to the actual measurement. For example, with the following option
included in a \fBserver\fP directive:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
presend 9
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
When the polling interval is 512 seconds or more, an extra NTP client packet
will be sent to the server a short time (2 seconds) before making the actual
measurement.
.sp
If the \fBpresend\fP option is used together with the \fBxleave\fP option, \fBchronyd\fP
will send two extra packets instead of one.
.RE
.sp
\fBminstratum\fP \fIstratum\fP
.RS 4
When the synchronisation source is selected from available sources, sources
with lower stratum are normally slightly preferred. This option can be used to
increase stratum of the source to the specified minimum, so \fBchronyd\fP will
avoid selecting that source. This is useful with low\-stratum sources that are
known to be unreliable or inaccurate and that should be used only when other
sources are unreachable.
.RE
.sp
\fBversion\fP \fIversion\fP
.RS 4
This option sets the NTP version of packets sent to the server. This can be
useful when the server runs an old NTP implementation that does not respond to
requests using a newer version. The default version depends on other options.
If the \fBextfield\fP or \fBxleave\fP option is used, the default version is 4. If
those options are not used and the \fBkey\fP option specifies a key using a hash
function with an output size longer than 160 bits (e.g. SHA256), the default
version is 3 for compatibility with older \fBchronyd\fP servers. In other cases,
the default version is 4.
.RE
.sp
\fBcopy\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies that the server and client are closely related, their
configuration does not allow a synchronisation loop to form between them, and
the client is allowed to assume the reference ID and stratum of the server.
This is useful when multiple instances of \f(CRchronyd\fP are running on one computer
(e.g. for security or performance reasons), one primarily operating as a client
to synchronise the system clock and other instances started with the \fB\-x\fP
option to operate as NTP servers for other computers with their NTP clocks
synchronised to the first instance.
.RE
.sp
\fBextfield\fP \fItype\fP
.RS 4
This option enables an NTPv4 extension field specified by its type as a
hexadecimal number. It will be included in requests sent to the server and
processed in received responses if the server supports it. Note that some
server implementations do not respond to requests containing an unknown
extension field (\fBchronyd\fP as a server responded to such requests since
version 2.0).
.sp
This option can be used multiple times to enable multiple extension fields.
.sp
The following extension fields are supported:
.sp
\fIF323\fP
.RS 4
An experimental extension field to enable several improvements that were
proposed for the next version of the NTP protocol (NTPv5). The field contains
root delay and dispersion in higher resolution and a monotonic receive
timestamp, which enables a frequency transfer between the server and client to
significantly improve stability of the synchronisation. This field should be
enabled only for servers known to be running \fBchronyd\fP version 4.2 or later.
.RE
.sp
\fIF324\fP
.RS 4
An experimental extension field to enable the use of the Precision Time
Protocol (PTP) correction field in NTP\-over\-PTP messages updated by one\-step
end\-to\-end transparent clocks in network switches and routers to significantly
improve accuracy and stability of the synchronisation. NTP\-over\-PTP can be
enabled by the \fBptpport\fP directive and setting the \fBport\fP option to
the PTP port. The corrections are applied only to NTP measurements with HW
timestamps (enabled by the \fBhwtimestamp\fP directive). This
field should be enabled only for servers known to be running \fBchronyd\fP version
4.5 or later.

\fBpool\fP \fIname\fP [\fIoption\fP]...
.RS 4
The syntax of this directive is similar to that for the \fBserver\fP
directive, except that it is used to specify a pool of NTP servers rather than
a single NTP server. The pool name is expected to resolve to multiple addresses
which might change over time.
.sp
This directive can be used multiple times to specify multiple pools.
.sp
All options valid in the \fBserver\fP directive can be used in this
directive too. There is one option specific to the \fBpool\fP directive:
.sp
\fBmaxsources\fP \fIsources\fP
.RS 4
This option sets the desired number of sources to be used from the pool.
\fBchronyd\fP will repeatedly try to resolve the name until it gets this number of

16.

\fBpeer\fP \fIhostname\fP [\fIoption\fP]...
.RS 4
The syntax of this directive is identical to that for the \fBserver\fP
directive, except that it specifies a symmetric association with an NTP peer
instead of a client/server association with an NTP server. A single symmetric
association allows the peers to be both servers and clients to each other. This
is mainly useful when the NTP implementation of the peer (e.g. \fBntpd\fP) supports
ephemeral symmetric associations and does not need to be configured with an
address of this host. \fBchronyd\fP does not support ephemeral associations.
.sp
This directive can be used multiple times to specify multiple peers.
.sp
The following options of the \fBserver\fP directive do not work in the \fBpeer\fP
directive: \fBiburst\fP, \fBburst\fP, \fBnts\fP, \fBpresend\fP, \fBcopy\fP.
.sp
When using the \fBxleave\fP option, both peers must support and have enabled the
interleaved mode; otherwise the synchronisation will work in one direction
only.
When a key is specified by the \fBkey\fP option to enable authentication, both
peers must use the same key and the same key number.
.sp
Note that the symmetric mode is less secure than the client/server mode. A
denial\-of\-service attack is possible on unauthenticated symmetric associations,
i.e. when the peer was specified without the \fBkey\fP option. An attacker who does
not see network traffic between two hosts, but knows that they are peering with
each other, can periodically send them unauthenticated packets with spoofed
source addresses in order to disrupt their NTP state and prevent them from
synchronising to each other. When the association is authenticated, an attacker
who does see the network traffic, but cannot prevent the packets from reaching
the other host, can still disrupt the state by replaying old packets. The
attacker has effectively the same power as a man\-in\-the\-middle attacker. A
partial protection against this attack is implemented in \fBchronyd\fP, which can
protect the peers if they are using the same polling interval and they never
sent an authenticated packet with a timestamp from future, but it should not be
relied on as it is difficult to ensure the conditions are met. If two hosts
should be able to synchronise to each other in both directions, it is
recommended to use two separate client/server associations (specified by the
\fBserver\fP directive on both hosts) instead.
.RE
.sp
\fBinitstepslew\fP \fIstep\-threshold\fP [\fIhostname\fP]...
.RS 4
(This directive is deprecated in favour of the \fBmakestep\fP
directive.)
.sp
The purpose of the \fBinitstepslew\fP directive is to allow \fBchronyd\fP to make a
rapid measurement of the system clock error at boot time and to correct the
system clock by stepping before normal operation begins. Since this would
normally be performed only at an appropriate point in the system boot sequence,
no other software should be adversely affected by the step.
.sp
If the correction required is less than a specified threshold, a slew is used
instead. This makes it safer to restart \fBchronyd\fP whilst the system is in
normal operation.
.sp
The \fBinitstepslew\fP directive takes a threshold and a list of NTP servers as
arguments. Each of the servers is rapidly polled several times, and a majority
voting mechanism used to find the most likely range of system clock error that
is present. A step or slew is applied to the system clock to correct this
error. \fBchronyd\fP then enters its normal operating mode.
.sp
An example of the use of the directive is:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
initstepslew 30 ntp1.example.net ntp2.example.net ntp3.example.net
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
where 3 NTP servers are used to make the measurement. The \fI30\fP indicates that
if the system\(cqs error is found to be 30 seconds or less, a slew will be used to
correct it; if the error is above 30 seconds, a step will be used.
.sp
The \fBinitstepslew\fP directive can also be used in an isolated LAN environment,
where the clocks are set manually. The most stable computer is chosen as the
primary server and the other computers are its clients. If each of the clients
is configured with the \fBlocal\fP directive, the server can be set up
with an \fBinitstepslew\fP directive that references some or all of the clients.
Then, if the server machine has to be rebooted, the clients can be relied on to
act analogously to a flywheel and preserve the time for a short period while
the server completes its reboot.
.sp
The \fBinitstepslew\fP directive is functionally similar to a combination of the
\fBmakestep\fP and \fBserver\fP directives with the \fBiburst\fP
option. The main difference is that the \fBinitstepslew\fP servers are used only
before normal operation begins and that the foreground \fBchronyd\fP process waits
for \fBinitstepslew\fP to finish before exiting. This prevent programs started in
the boot sequence after \fBchronyd\fP from reading the clock before it has been
stepped. With the \fBmakestep\fP directive, the
\fBwaitsync\fP command of \fBchronyc\fP can be used instead.

samples from another application running on the system. The parameter is the
path to the socket, which \fBchronyd\fP will create on start. The format of the
messages is described in the \fIrefclock_sock.c\fP file in the chrony source code.
.sp
An application that supports the SOCK protocol is the \fBgpsd\fP daemon. It can
provide accurate measurements using the receiver\(cqs PPS signal, and since
version 3.25 also (much less accurate) measurements based on the timing of
serial data (e.g. NMEA), which can be useful when the receiver does not provide
a PPS signal, or it cannot be connected to the computer. The paths where \fBgpsd\fP
expects the sockets to be created by \fBchronyd\fP are described in the \fBgpsd(8)\fP
man page. Note that \fBgpsd\fP needs to be started after \fBchronyd\fP in order to
connect to the socket.

\fBSHM\fP
.RS 4
NTP shared memory driver. This driver implements the protocol of the \fBntpd\fP
driver type 28. It is functionally similar to the SOCK driver, but uses a
shared memory segment instead of a socket. The parameter is the unit number,
typically a small number like 0, 1, 2, or 3, from which is derived the key of
the memory segment as 0x4e545030 + unit.
.sp
The driver supports the following option:
.sp
\fBperm\fP=\fImode\fP

This option specifies the permissions of the shared memory segment created by
\fBchronyd\fP. They are specified as a numeric mode. The default value is 0600
(read\-write access for owner only).
.RE
.RE
.sp

.RS 4
.sp
Unlike with the SOCK driver, there is no prescribed order of starting \fBchronyd\fP
and the program providing measurements. Both are expected to create the memory
segment if it does not exist. \fBchronyd\fP will attach to an existing segment even
if it has a different owner than root or different permissions than the
permissions specified by the \fBperm\fP option. The segment needs to be created
before untrusted applications or users can execute code to prevent an attacker
from feeding \fBchronyd\fP with false measurements. The owner and permissions of
the segment can be verified with the \fBipcs \-m\fP command. For this reason, the
SHM driver is deprecated in favor of SOCK.

\fBPHC\fP
.RS 4
PTP hardware clock (PHC) driver. The parameter is the absolute path to the
device of the PTP clock which should be used as a time source, or the name of
the network interface whose PTP clock should be used. If the clock is kept in
TAI instead of UTC (e.g. it is synchronised by a PTP daemon), the current
UTC\-TAI offset needs to be specified by the \fBoffset\fP option. Alternatively, the
\fBpps\fP refclock option can be enabled to treat the PHC as a PPS refclock, using
only the sub\-second offset for synchronisation. The driver supports the
following options:

\fBextpps\fP

This option enables a PPS mode in which the PTP clock is timestamping pulses

clear events, and it is necessary to use the \fBwidth\fP option to filter wrong
PPS samples.

Timestamps produced by refclock drivers are not used immediately, but they are
stored and processed by a median filter in the polling interval specified by
this option. This is defined as a power of 2 and can be negative to specify a
sub\-second interval. The default is 4 (16 seconds). A shorter interval allows

This option sets the rate of the pulses in the PPS signal (in Hz). This option

This option specifies the width of the pulses (in seconds). It is used to
filter PPS samples when the driver provides samples for both rising and falling

completes the PPS samples. If the duty cycle is configurable, 50% should be
preferred in order to maximise the allowed error.
.RE

This option sets the maximum number of samples that can be stored in the median
filter between polls of the source. The filter combines about 60 percent of the
samples closest to the median offset into one sample. If more samples are

\fBacquisitionport\fP \fIport\fP
.RS 4
By default, \fBchronyd\fP as an NTP client opens a new socket for each request with
the source port chosen randomly by the operating system. The \fBacquisitionport\fP
directive can be used to specify the source port and use only one socket (per
IPv4 or IPv6 address family) for all configured servers. This can be useful for
getting through some firewalls. It should not be used if not necessary as there
is a small impact on security of the client. If set to 0, the source port of
the permanent socket will be chosen randomly by the operating system.

It can be set to the same port as is used by the NTP server (which can be

To compute the rate of gain or loss of time, \fBchronyd\fP has to store a

All supported systems, with the exception of macOS 10.12 and earlier, have
operating system support for setting the rate of gain or loss to compensate for
known errors.
(On macOS 10.12 and earlier, \fBchronyd\fP must simulate such a capability by
periodically slewing the system clock forwards or backwards by a suitable amount
to compensate for the error built up since the previous slew.)
.sp
For such systems, it is possible to save the measurement history across
restarts of \fBchronyd\fP (assuming no changes are made to the system clock
behaviour whilst it is not running). The \fBdumpdir\fP directive defines the
directory where the measurement histories are saved when \fBchronyd\fP exits,

NTP sources can be specified with the \fBkey\fP or \fBnts\fP option to enable
authentication to limit the impact of man\-in\-the\-middle attacks. The
attackers can drop or delay NTP packets (up to the \fBmaxdelay\fP and
\fBmaxdistance\fP limits), but they cannot modify the timestamps
contained in the packets. The attack can cause only a limited slew or step, and
also cause the clock to run faster or slower than real time (up to double
the \fBmaxdrift\fP limit).
.sp
When authentication is enabled for an NTP source, it is important to disable
unauthenticated NTP sources that could be exploited in the attack, e.g. if
they are not reachable only over a trusted network. Alternatively, the source
selection can be configured with the \fBrequire\fP and \fBtrust\fP options to
synchronise to the unauthenticated sources only if they agree with the
authenticated sources and might have a positive impact on the accuracy of the
clock. Note that in this case the impact of the attack is higher. The attackers
cannot cause an arbitrarily large step or slew, but they have more control over
the frequency of the clock and can cause \fBchronyd\fP to report false information,
e.g. a significantly smaller root delay and dispersion.

When \fBchronyd\fP has multiple sources available for synchronisation, it has to
select one source as the synchronisation source. The measured offsets and
frequencies of the system clock relative to the other sources, however, can be
combined with the selected source to improve the accuracy of the system clock.
.sp
The \fBcombinelimit\fP directive limits which sources are included in the combining
algorithm. Their synchronisation distance has to be shorter than the distance
of the selected source multiplied by the value of the limit. Also, their
measured frequencies have to be close to the frequency of the selected source.
If the selected source was specified with the \fBprefer\fP option, it can be
combined only with other sources specified with this option.

By default, the limit is 3. Setting the limit to 0 effectively disables the

The \fBmaxdistance\fP directive sets the maximum root distance of a source to be

larger than the specified distance will be rejected. The distance estimates the
maximum error of the source. It includes the root dispersion and half of the
root delay (round\-trip time) accumulated on the path to the primary source.

By default, the maximum root distance is 3 seconds.

\fBclockprecision\fP \fIprecision\fP
.RS 4
The \fBclockprecision\fP directive specifies the precision of the system clock (in
seconds). It is used by \fBchronyd\fP to estimate the minimum noise in NTP
measurements and randomise low\-order bits of timestamps in NTP responses. By
default, the precision is measured on start\-up as the minimum time to read the
clock.
.sp
The measured value works well in most cases. It generally overestimates the
precision and it can be sensitive to the CPU speed, however, which can
change over time to save power. In some cases with a high\-precision clocksource
(e.g. the Time Stamp Counter of the CPU) and hardware timestamping, setting the
precision on the server to a smaller value can improve stability of clients\*(Aq
NTP measurements. The server\(cqs precision is reported on clients by the
\fBntpdata\fP command.

\fBcorrtimeratio\fP \fIratio\fP
.RS 4
When \fBchronyd\fP is slewing the system clock to correct an offset, the rate at
which it is slewing adds to the frequency error of the clock. On all supported
systems, with the exception of macOS 12 and earlier, this rate can be
controlled.
.sp
The \fBcorrtimeratio\fP directive sets the ratio between the duration in which the
clock is slewed for an average correction according to the source history and
the interval in which the corrections are done (usually the NTP polling
interval). Corrections larger than the average take less time and smaller
corrections take more time; the amount of the correction and the correction
time are inversely proportional.
.sp
Increasing \fBcorrtimeratio\fP improves the overall frequency error of the system
clock, but increases the overall time error as the corrections take longer.
.sp
By default, the ratio is set to 3, the time accuracy of the clock is preferred
over its frequency accuracy.

The maximum allowed slew rate can be set by the \fBmaxslewrate\fP

\fBdriftfile\fP \fIfile\fP [\fBinterval\fP \fIinterval\fP]
.RS 4
One of the main activities of the \fBchronyd\fP program is to work out the rate at
which the system clock gains or loses time relative to real time.
.sp
Whenever \fBchronyd\fP computes a new value of the gain or loss rate, it is desirable
to record it somewhere. This allows \fBchronyd\fP to begin compensating the system
clock at that rate whenever it is restarted, even before it has had a chance to
obtain an equally good estimate of the rate during the new run. (This process
can take many minutes, at least.)
.sp
The \fBdriftfile\fP directive allows a file to be specified into which \fBchronyd\fP
can store the rate information. Two parameters are recorded in the file. The
first is the rate at which the system clock gains or loses time, expressed in
parts per million, with gains positive. Therefore, a value of 100.0 indicates
that when the system clock has advanced by a second, it has gained 100
microseconds in reality (so the true time has only advanced by 999900
microseconds). The second is an estimate of the error bound around the first
value in which the true rate actually lies.
.sp
The \fBinterval\fP option specifies the minimum interval between updates of the
file in seconds. The file is written only on an update of the local clock.
The default interval is 3600 seconds.

An example of the driftfile directive is:

\fBfallbackdrift\fP \fImin\-interval\fP \fImax\-interval\fP

Fallback drifts are long\-term averages of the system clock drift calculated
over exponentially increasing intervals. They are used to avoid quickly
drifting away from true time when the clock was not updated for a longer period
of time and there was a short\-term deviation in the drift before the updates
stopped.
.sp
The directive specifies the minimum and maximum interval since the last clock
update to switch between fallback drifts. They are defined as a power of 2 (in
seconds). The syntax is as follows:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
fallbackdrift 16 19
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
In this example, the minimum interval is 16 (18 hours) and the maximum interval is
19 (6 days). The system clock frequency will be set to the first fallback 18
hours after the last clock update, to the second after 36 hours, and so on. This
might be a good setting to cover frequency changes due to daily and weekly
temperature fluctuations. When the frequency is set to a fallback, the state of
the clock will change to \(oqNot synchronised\(cq.
.sp
By default (or if the specified maximum or minimum is 0), no fallbacks are used
and the clock frequency changes only with new measurements from NTP sources,
reference clocks, or manual input.

\fBleapsecmode\fP \fImode\fP

A leap second is an adjustment that is occasionally applied to UTC to keep it
close to the mean solar time. When a leap second is inserted, the last day of
June or December has an extra second 23:59:60.
.sp
For computer clocks that is a problem. The Unix time is defined as number of
seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 without leap seconds. The system
clock cannot have time 23:59:60, every minute has 60 seconds and every day has
86400 seconds by definition. The inserted leap second is skipped and the clock
is suddenly ahead of UTC by one second. The \fBleapsecmode\fP directive selects how
that error is corrected. There are four options:
.sp
\fBsystem\fP
.RS 4
When inserting a leap second, the kernel steps the system clock backwards by
one second when the clock gets to 00:00:00 UTC. When deleting a leap second, it
steps forward by one second when the clock gets to 23:59:59 UTC. This is the
default mode when the system driver supports leap seconds (i.e. all supported

This is similar to the \fBsystem\fP mode, except the clock is stepped by

No correction is applied to the clock for the leap second. The clock will be

.RS 4
.sp
When serving time to NTP clients that cannot be configured to correct their
clocks for a leap second by slewing, or to clients that would correct at
slightly different rates when it is necessary to keep them close together, the
\fBslew\fP mode can be combined with the \fBsmoothtime\fP directive to
enable a server leap smear.
.sp
When smearing a leap second, the leap status is suppressed on the server and
the served time is corrected slowly by slewing instead of stepping. The clients
do not need any special configuration as they do not know there is any leap
second and they follow the server time which eventually brings them back to
UTC. Care must be taken to ensure they use only NTP servers that smear the
leap second in exactly the same way for synchronisation.
.sp
This feature must be used carefully, because the server is intentionally not
serving its best estimate of the true time.
.sp
A recommended configuration to enable a server leap smear is:
.sp
.if n .RS 4

The first directive is necessary to disable the clock step which would reset
the smoothing process. The second directive limits the slewing rate of the
local clock to 1000 ppm, which improves the stability of the smoothing process
when the local correction starts and ends. The third directive enables the
server time smoothing process. It will start when the clock gets to 00:00:00
UTC and it will take 62500 seconds (about 17.36 hours) to finish. The frequency
offset will be changing by 0.001024 ppm per second and will reach a maximum of
32 ppm in 31250 seconds. The \fBleaponly\fP option makes the duration of the leap
smear constant and allows the clients to safely synchronise with multiple
identically configured leap smearing servers.

\fBleapsectz\fP \fItimezone\fP

This directive specifies a timezone in the system timezone database which
\fBchronyd\fP can use to determine when the next leap second occurs and what
the current offset between TAI and UTC is. It will periodically check if 23:59:59
and 23:59:60 are valid times in the timezone. This normally works with the
\fIright/UTC\fP timezone.
.sp
When a leap second is announced, the timezone needs to be updated at least 12
hours before the leap second. It is not necessary to restart \fBchronyd\fP.
.sp
This directive is useful with reference clocks and other time sources that do
not announce leap seconds, or announce them too late for an NTP server to
forward them to its own clients. Clients of leap smearing servers must not
use this directive.
.sp
It is also useful when the system clock is required to have correct TAI\-UTC
offset. Note that the offset is set only when leap seconds are handled by the
kernel, i.e. \fBleapsecmode\fP is set to \fBsystem\fP.
.sp
The specified timezone is not used as an exclusive source of information about
leap seconds. If a majority of time sources announce on the last day of June or
December that a leap second should be inserted or deleted, it will be accepted

Normally \fBchronyd\fP will cause the system to gradually correct any time offset

e.g. when \fBchronyd\fP is initially started, the system clock might be so far
adrift that this slewing process would take a very long time to correct the
system clock.
.sp
This directive forces \fBchronyd\fP to step the system clock if the adjustment is
larger than a threshold value, but only if there were no more clock updates
since \fBchronyd\fP was started than the specified limit. A negative value disables
the limit.

On most systems it is desirable to step the system clock only on boot, before

large initial offset to be corrected on start. Offsets larger than the

.sp
If the range of error is too large, it probably indicates that the measurements
have not settled down yet, and that the estimated gain or loss rate is not very
reliable.
.sp
The \fBmaxupdateskew\fP directive sets the threshold for determining whether an

Typical values for \fIskew\-in\-ppm\fP might be 100 for NTP sources polled over a

It should be noted that this is not the only means of protection against using
unreliable estimates. At all times, \fBchronyd\fP keeps track of both the estimated
gain or loss rate, and the error bound on the estimate. When a new estimate is

Normally, changes in the rate of drift of the system clock are caused mainly by
changes in the temperature of the crystal oscillator on the motherboard.
.sp
If there are temperature measurements available from a sensor close to the
oscillator, the \fBtempcomp\fP directive can be used to compensate for the changes
in the temperature and improve the stability and accuracy of the clock.
.sp
The result depends on many factors, including the resolution of the sensor, the
amount of noise in the measurements, the polling interval of the time source,
the compensation update interval, how well the compensation is specified, and
how close the sensor is to the oscillator. When it is working well, the
frequency reported in the \fItracking.log\fP file is more stable and the maximum
reached offset is smaller.
.sp
There are two forms of the directive. The first one has six parameters: a path
to the file containing the current temperature from the sensor (in text
format), the compensation update interval (in seconds), and temperature
coefficients \fIT0\fP, \fIk0\fP, \fIk1\fP, \fIk2\fP.

In the first example, the effect is the same regardless of what order the three

In the second example, the \fBallow all 1.2.0.0/16\fP directive overrides the
effect of \fIany\fP previous directive relating to a subnet within the specified

directives matters if they modify the same records of one table, i.e. if one
subnet is included in the other subnet and their prefix lengths are at the same
level. For example, \fI1.2.3.0/28\fP and \fI1.2.3.0/29\fP are in different tables, but
\fI1.2.3.0/25\fP and \fI1.2.3.0/28\fP are in the same table. The configuration can be
verified for individual addresses with the \fBaccheck\fP
command in \fBchronyc\fP.
.sp
A hostname can be specified in the directives instead of the IP address, but
the name must be resolvable when \fBchronyd\fP is started, i.e. the network is
already up and DNS is working. If the hostname resolves to multiple addresses,
only the first address (in the order returned by the system resolver) will be
allowed or denied.

Note, if the \fBinitstepslew\fP directive is used in the
configuration file, each of the computers listed in that directive must allow
client access by this computer for it to work.

\fBbindaddress\fP \fIaddress\fP

The \fBbindaddress\fP directive binds the sockets on which \fBchronyd\fP listens for
NTP and NTS\-KE requests to a local address of the computer. On systems other
than Linux, the address of the computer needs to be already configured when
\fBchronyd\fP is started.

\fBbroadcast\fP \fIinterval\fP \fIaddress\fP [\fIport\fP]
.RS 4
The \fBbroadcast\fP directive is used to declare a broadcast address to which
chronyd should send packets in the NTP broadcast mode (i.e. make \fBchronyd\fP act
as a broadcast server). Broadcast clients on that subnet will be able to
synchronise.
.sp
This directive can be used multiple times to specify multiple addresses.
.sp
The syntax is as follows:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
broadcast 32 192.168.1.255
broadcast 64 192.168.2.255 12123
broadcast 64 ff02::101
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
In the first example, the destination port defaults to UDP port 123 (the normal NTP
port). In the second example, the destination port is specified as 12123. The
first parameter in each case (32 or 64 respectively) is the interval in seconds
between broadcast packets being sent. The second parameter in each case is the
broadcast address to send the packet to. This should correspond to the
broadcast address of one of the network interfaces on the computer where
\fBchronyd\fP is running.
.sp
You can have more than 1 \fBbroadcast\fP directive if you have more than 1 network
interface onto which you want to send NTP broadcast packets.
.sp
\fBchronyd\fP itself cannot act as a broadcast client; it must always be configured
as a point\-to\-point client by defining specific NTP servers and peers. This
broadcast server feature is intended for providing a time source to other NTP
implementations.
.sp
If \fBntpd\fP is used as the broadcast client, it will try to measure the
round\-trip delay between the server and client with normal client mode packets.
Thus, the broadcast subnet should also be the subject of an \fBallow\fP
directive.

This directive specifies the maximum amount of memory that \fBchronyd\fP is allowed

NTP server needs to support the interleaved mode for its clients. The default
limit is 524288 bytes, which enables monitoring of up to 4096 IP addresses at
the same time and holding NTP timestamps for up to 4096 clients using the
interleaved mode (depending on uniformity of their polling interval). The
number of addresses and timestamps is always a power of 2. The maximum
effective value is 2147483648 (2 GB), which corresponds to 16777216 addresses

\fBlocal\fP [\fIoption\fP]...
.RS 4
The \fBlocal\fP directive enables a local reference mode, which allows \fBchronyd\fP
operating as an NTP server to appear synchronised to real time (from the
viewpoint of clients polling it), even when it was never synchronised or
the last update of the clock happened a long time ago.
.sp
This directive is normally used in an isolated network, where computers are
required to be synchronised to one another, but not necessarily to real time.
The server can be kept vaguely in line with real time by manual input.
.sp
The \fBlocal\fP directive has the following options:
.sp
\fBstratum\fP \fIstratum\fP
.RS 4
This option sets the stratum of the server which will be reported to clients
when the local reference is active. The specified value is in the range 1
through 15, and the default value is 10. It should be larger than the maximum
expected stratum in the network when external NTP servers are accessible.
.sp
Stratum 1 indicates a computer that has a true real\-time reference directly
connected to it (e.g. GPS, atomic clock, etc.), such computers are expected to
be very close to real time. Stratum 2 computers are those that have a stratum
1 server; stratum 3 computers have a stratum 2 server and so on. A value
of 10 indicates that the clock is so many hops away from a reference clock that
its time is fairly unreliable.
.RE
.sp
\fBdistance\fP \fIdistance\fP
.RS 4
This option sets the threshold for the root distance which will activate the local
reference. If \fBchronyd\fP was synchronised to a configured time source, the local
reference will not be activated until its root distance reaches the specified
value (the rate at which the distance is increasing depends on how well the
clock was tracking the source). When the clock is not synchronised, it is
considered to have an infinite root distance, i.e. the local reference
activates as soon as allowed by the \fBwaitunsynced\fP option. The default
threshold is 1 second.
.sp
The current root distance can be calculated from root delay and root dispersion
(reported by the \fBtracking\fP command in \fBchronyc\fP) as:

\fBactivate\fP \fIdistance\fP

This option sets an activating root distance for the local reference. The
local reference will not be used until the root distance drops below the
configured value for the first time. This can be used to prevent the local
reference from being activated on a server which has never been synchronised
with an upstream server. The default value of 0.0 causes no activating
distance to be used, such that the local reference is always eligible for
activation.
.RE
.sp
\fBorphan\fP
.RS 4
This option enables a special \(oqorphan\(cq mode, where sources with stratum equal
to the local \fIstratum\fP are assumed to not serve real time. They are ignored
unless no other source is selectable and their reference IDs are smaller than
the local reference ID.
.sp
This allows multiple servers in the network to use the same \fBlocal\fP
configuration and to be synchronised to one another without confusing clients
that poll more than one server. Each server needs to be configured to poll all
other servers with the \fBlocal\fP directive. This ensures only the server with the
smallest reference ID has the local reference active and others are
synchronised to it. If that server stops responding, the server with the second
smallest reference ID will take over when its local reference mode activates
(root distance reaches the threshold configured by the \fBdistance\fP option).
.sp
The \fBorphan\fP mode is compatible with the \fBntpd\fP\*(Aqs orphan mode (enabled by the
\fBtos orphan\fP command).

This option specifies the minimum interval (in seconds) between the last update

\fBdistance\fP and \fBactivate\fP options. The \fBdistance\fP option can be set to 0 to
ignore the root distance and control the activation only by the interval. In
such case it should be at least as long as the maximum expected polling
interval to prevent frequent activation in normal polling of the source.
The default minimum interval is 0.
.RE
.sp
\fBwaitunsynced\fP \fIinterval\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies how long (in seconds) \fBchronyd\fP needs to wait before
activating the local reference when the clock is not considered to be
synchronised (e.g. after start or the source selection failing due to no
majority). This delay prevents \fBchronyd\fP from serving incorrect time to clients
before the configured time sources are given a chance to synchronise the local
clock. The default interval is 300 seconds if the \fBorphan\fP option is set,
otherwise it is 0 (i.e. local reference activates immediately).

be separated from the NTP server. The servers need to share the keys, however,

time to get new cookies encrypted by the latest key. The interval is measured
as the server\(cqs operating time, i.e. the actual interval can be longer if
\fBchronyd\fP is not running continuously. The default interval is 604800 seconds

be periodically copied from another server running \fBchronyd\fP (which does
not have \fBntsrotate\fP set to 0) in order to have one or more servers dedicated
to NTS\-KE. The file includes the subsequent key to which the NTS\-KE server will
switch on the next rotation, i.e. the process copying and reloading the file
does not need to be timed precisely (it can be delayed by up to one rotation
interval). The NTS\-KE servers need to be configured with the

addresses. If multiple clients share one IP address (e.g. multiple hosts behind
NAT), the sum of their traffic will be limited. If a client that increases its
polling rate when it does not receive a reply is detected, its rate limiting
will be temporarily suspended to avoid increasing the overall amount of

\fBsmoothtime\fP \fImax\-freq\fP \fImax\-wander\fP [\fBleaponly\fP]
.RS 4
The \fBsmoothtime\fP directive can be used to enable smoothing of the time that
\fBchronyd\fP serves to its clients to make it easier for them to track it and keep
their clocks close together even when large offset or frequency corrections are
applied to the server\(cqs clock, for example, after being offline for a longer
time.
.sp
BE WARNED: The server is intentionally not serving its best estimate of the
true time. If a large offset has been accumulated, it can take a very long time
to smooth it out. This directive should be used only when the clients are not
configured to poll another NTP server also, because they could reject this
server as a falseticker or fail to select a source completely.
.sp
The smoothing process is implemented with a quadratic spline function with two
or three pieces. It is independent from any slewing applied to the local system
clock, but the accumulated offset and frequency will be reset when the clock is
corrected by stepping, e.g. by the \fBmakestep\fP directive or the
\fBmakestep\fP command in \fBchronyc\fP. The process can be
reset without stepping the clock by the \fBsmoothtime
reset\fP command.
.sp
The first two arguments of the directive are the maximum frequency offset of
the smoothed time to the tracked NTP time (in ppm) and the maximum rate at
which the frequency offset is allowed to change (in ppm per second). \fBleaponly\fP
is an optional third argument that enables a mode where only leap seconds are
smoothed out and normal offset and frequency changes are ignored. The \fBleaponly\fP
option is useful in a combination with the \fBleapsecmode slew\fP
directive to allow the clients to use multiple time smoothing servers safely.
.sp
The smoothing process is activated automatically when 1/10000 of the estimated
skew of the local clock falls below the maximum rate of frequency change. It
can be also activated manually by the \fBsmoothtime
activate\fP command, which is particularly useful when the clock is
synchronised only with manual input and the skew is always larger than the
threshold. The \fBsmoothing\fP command can be used to
monitor the process.

\fBcmdallow\fP [\fBall\fP] [\fIsubnet\fP]
.RS 4
This is similar to the \fBallow\fP directive, except that it allows
monitoring access (rather than NTP client access) to a particular subnet or
host. (By \(oqmonitoring access\(cq is meant that \fBchronyc\fP can be run on those
hosts and retrieve monitoring data from \fBchronyd\fP on this computer.)
.sp
The syntax is identical to the \fBallow\fP directive.
.sp
There is also a \fBcmdallow all\fP directive with similar behaviour to the \fBallow
all\fP directive (but applying to monitoring access in this case, of course).
.sp
Addresses \fI127.0.0.1\fP and \fI::1\fP (i.e. the loopback interface) are always
allowed.
.sp
Note that \fBchronyd\fP has to be configured with the
\fBbindcmdaddress\fP directive to not listen only on the
loopback interface to actually allow remote access.

\fBcmdport\fP \fIport\fP
.RS 4
The \fBcmdport\fP directive allows the port that is used for run\-time monitoring
(via the \fBchronyc\fP program) to be altered from its default (323). If set to 0,
\fBchronyd\fP will not open the port, which disables remote \fBchronyc\fP access (with
a non\-default \fBbindcmdaddress\fP) and local access for unprivileged users. It
does not disable the Unix domain command socket.
.sp
An example shows the syntax:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
cmdport 257
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
This would make \fBchronyd\fP use UDP 257 as its command port. (\fBchronyc\fP would
need to be run with the \fB\-p 257\fP option to inter\-operate correctly.)

\fBcmdratelimit\fP [\fIoption\fP]...

This directive enables response rate limiting for command packets. It is

second), and the \fBkod\fP option is not supported.

\fBopencommands\fP [\fIcommand\fP]...
.RS 4
This directive specifies a list of monitoring commands to be enabled for the
hosts allowed by the \fBcmdallow\fP directive. The following commands can be
specified (the naming follows \fBchronyc\fP):
.sp
\fBactivity\fP*, \fBauthdata\fP, \fBclients\fP, \fBmanual\fP*, \fBntpdata\fP, \fBrtcdata\fP*,
\fBselectdata\fP, \fBserverstats\fP*, \fBsmoothing\fP*, \fBsourcename\fP*, \fBsources\fP*,
\fBsourcestats\fP, \fBtracking\fP*.
.sp
The commands marked with * are enabled by default. The protocol of these
commands is considered stable and can be expected to work between different
versions of \fBchronyc\fP and \fBchronyd\fP. The protocol of the other commands is not
considered stable and different versions of \fBchronyc\fP and \fBchronyd\fP may not
interoperate. When that happens, \fBchronyc\fP will print an \(oqInvalid command\(cq or
\(oqBad reply from daemon\(cq error.
.sp
Note that some of the reported data can be potentially useful to attackers,
enabling them to observe and predict better the internal state of \fBchronyd\fP.
It is recommended to enable only commands that are actually needed for
monitoring and limit the access to the hosts that need it.

\fBhwclockfile\fP \fIfile\fP

The \fBhwclockfile\fP directive sets the location of the adjtime file which is
used by the \fBhwclock\fP program on Linux. \fBchronyd\fP parses the file to find out
if the RTC keeps local time or UTC. It overrides the \fBrtconutc\fP

The \fBrtcautotrim\fP directive is used to keep the RTC close to the system clock
automatically. When the system clock is synchronised and the estimated error
between the two clocks is larger than the specified threshold, \fBchronyd\fP will
trim the RTC as if the \fBtrimrtc\fP command in \fBchronyc\fP
was issued. The trimming operation is accurate to only about 1 second, which is
the minimum effective threshold.
.sp
This directive is effective only with the \fBrtcfile\fP directive.

An example of the use of this directive is:

\fBchronyd\fP saves information in this file when it exits and when the \fBwritertc\fP

the RTC gains or loses time.

So far, the support for real\-time clocks is limited; their code is even more
system\-specific than the rest of the software. You can only use the RTC
facilities (the \fBrtcfile\fP directive and the \fB\-s\fP command\-line
option to \fBchronyd\fP) if the following three conditions apply:

\fBrtconutc\fP
.RS 4
\fBchronyd\fP assumes by default that the RTC keeps local time (including any
daylight saving changes). This is convenient on PCs running Linux that are
dual\-booted with Windows.
.sp
If you keep the RTC on local time and your computer is off when daylight saving
(summer time) starts or ends, the computer\(cqs system time will be one hour in
error when you next boot and start chronyd.
.sp
An alternative is for the RTC to keep Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). This
does not suffer from the 1 hour problem when daylight saving starts or ends.
.sp
If the \fBrtconutc\fP directive appears, it means the RTC is required to keep UTC.
The directive takes no arguments. It is equivalent to specifying the \fB\-u\fP
switch to the Linux \fBhwclock\fP program.
.sp
Note that this setting is overridden by the \fBhwclockfile\fP file
and is not relevant for the \fBrtcsync\fP directive or when the RTC
is used as reference clock.
.RE
.sp
\fBrtcsync\fP
.RS 4
The \fBrtcsync\fP directive enables a mode where the system time is periodically
copied to the RTC and \fBchronyd\fP does not try to track its drift. This directive
cannot be used with the \fBrtcfile\fP directive.
.sp
On Linux, the RTC copy is performed by the kernel every 11 minutes.
.sp
On macOS, \fBchronyd\fP will perform the RTC copy every 60 minutes
when the system clock is in a synchronised state.

On other systems this directive does nothing.

\fBhwtimestamp\fP \fIinterface\fP [\fIoption\fP]...
.RS 4
This directive enables hardware timestamping of NTP packets sent to and
received from the specified network interface. The network interface controller
(NIC) uses its own clock to accurately timestamp the actual transmissions and
receptions, avoiding processing and queueing delays in the kernel, network
driver, and hardware. This can significantly improve the accuracy of the
timestamps and the measured offset, which is used for synchronisation of the
system clock. In order to get the best results, both sides receiving and
sending NTP packets (i.e. server and client, or two peers) need to use HW
timestamping. If the server or peer supports the interleaved mode, it needs to
be enabled by the \fBxleave\fP option in the \fBserver\fP or the
\fBpeer\fP directive.
.sp
This directive is supported on Linux 3.19 and newer. The NIC must support HW
timestamping, which can be verified with the \fBethtool \-T\fP command. The list of
capabilities should include \fIhardware\-raw\-clock\fP, \fIhardware\-transmit\fP, and
\fIhardware\-receive\fP. The receive filter \fIall\fP, or \fIntp\fP, is necessary for
timestamping of received NTP packets. Timestamping of packets received on
bridged and bonded interfaces is supported on Linux 4.13 and newer. If HW
timestamping does not work for received packets, \fBchronyd\fP will use kernel
receive timestamps instead. Transmit\-only HW timestamping can still be useful
to improve stability of the synchronisation.
.sp
\fBchronyd\fP does not synchronise the NIC clock. It assumes the clock is running
free. Multiple instances of \fBchronyd\fP can use the same interface with enabled
HW timestamping. Applications which need HW timestamping with a synchronised
clock (e.g. a PTP daemon) should use a virtual clock running on top of the
physical clock created by writing to \fI/sys/class/ptp/ptpX/n_vclocks\fP. This
feature is available on Linux 5.14 and newer.
.sp
If the kernel supports software timestamping, it will be enabled for all
interfaces automatically.
.sp
The source of timestamps (i.e. hardware, kernel, or daemon) is indicated on the
client side in the \fImeasurements.log\fP file (if enabled by the \fBlog\fP
directive) and the \fBntpdata\fP report. On the server
side, the number of served timestamps from each source is provided in the
\fBserverstats\fP report.
.sp
This directive can be used multiple times to enable HW timestamping on multiple
interfaces. If the specified interface is \fI*\fP, \fBchronyd\fP will try to enable HW
timestamping on all available interfaces.
.sp
The \fBhwtimestamp\fP directive has the following options:
.sp
\fBminpoll\fP \fIpoll\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies the minimum interval between readings of the NIC clock.
It\(cqs defined as a power of 2. It should correspond to the minimum polling
interval of all NTP sources and the minimum expected polling interval of NTP
clients. The default value is 0 (1 second), the minimum value is \-6 (1/64th

.RE
.sp
\fBmaxpoll\fP \fIpoll\fP

the \fBminpoll\fP option.

The most specific filter for timestamping of NTP packets supported by the NIC
is selected by default. Some NICs can timestamp PTP packets only. By default,
they will be configured with the \fInone\fP filter and expected to provide hardware
timestamps for transmitted packets only. Timestamping of PTP packets is useful
with NTP\-over\-PTP enabled by the \fBptpport\fP
directive, or when another application is receiving PTP packets on the
interface. Forcing timestamping of all packets with the \fIall\fP filter could be
useful if the NIC supported both the \fIall\fP and \fIntp\fP filters, and it should
timestamp both NTP and PTP packets, or NTP packets on a different UDP port.

\fBhwtstimeout\fP \fItimeout\fP
.RS 4
If hardware timestamping is used with a close NTP server, or the NIC or its
driver is slow in providing the transmit timestamp of NTP requests, a response
from the server can be received before the transmit timestamp of the request.
To avoid calculating the offset with a less accurate transmit timestamp,
\fBchronyd\fP can save the response for later processing and wait for the hardware
transmit timestamp. There is no guarantee that the timestamp will be provided
(NICs typically have a limited rate of transmit timestamping). This directive
configures how long \fBchronyd\fP should wait for the timestamp after receiving a
valid response from the server. If a second valid response is received from the
server while waiting for the timestamp, they will be both processed
immediately.
.sp
The default value is 0.001 seconds, which should be sufficient with most
hardware. If you frequently see kernel transmit timestamps in the
\fImeasurements.log\fP file or \fBntpdata\fP report, and it is
not a server handling a high rate of requests in the interleaved mode on the
same interface (which would compete with timestamping of the server\(cqs own
requests), increasing the timeout to 0.01 or possibly even longer might help.
Note that the maximum timeout is limited by the NTP polling interval.

.if n .RE
.sp
Each line consists of an ID, optional type, and key.
.sp
The ID can be any positive integer in the range 1 through 2^32\-1.
.sp
The type is a name of a cryptographic hash function or cipher that is used to
generate and verify the MAC. The default type is \fBMD5\fP, which is always
supported.
If \fBchronyd\fP was built with enabled support for hashing using a crypto library
(Nettle, GnuTLS, NSS, or LibTomCrypt), the following functions are available: \fBMD5\fP,
\fBSHA1\fP, \fBSHA256\fP, \fBSHA384\fP, \fBSHA512\fP. Depending on which library and version is
\fBchronyd\fP using, some of the following hash functions and ciphers may
also be available:
\fBSHA3\-224\fP, \fBSHA3\-256\fP, \fBSHA3\-384\fP, \fBSHA3\-512\fP, \fBTIGER\fP, \fBWHIRLPOOL\fP, \fBAES128\fP,
\fBAES256\fP.
.sp
The key can be specified as a string of ASCII characters not containing white
space with an optional \fBASCII:\fP prefix, or as a hexadecimal number with the
\fBHEX:\fP prefix. The maximum length of the line is 2047 characters.
If the type is a cipher, the length of the key must match the cipher (i.e. 128
bits for AES128 and 256 bits for AES256).
.sp
It is recommended to use randomly generated keys, specified in the hexadecimal
format, which are at least 128 bits long (i.e. they have at least 32 characters
after the \fBHEX:\fP prefix). \fBchronyd\fP will log a warning to syslog on start if a
source is specified in the configuration file with a key shorter than 80 bits.
.sp
The recommended key types are AES ciphers and SHA3 hash functions. MD5 should
be avoided unless no other type is supported on the server and client, or
peers. A major weakness of MD5 for the NTP MAC is a length extension attack,
where a man\-in\-the\-middle attacker can add arbitrary extension fields to the
NTP message and update the MAC to pass the verification of the extended
message. The \fBextfield\fP option (enabling processing of the specified extension
field) should not be used for NTP sources authenticated with an MD5 key.
.sp
The \fBkeygen\fP command of \fBchronyc\fP can be used to
generate random keys for the key file. By default, it generates 160\-bit MD5 or
SHA1 keys.
.sp
For security reasons, the file should be readable only by root and the user
under which \fBchronyd\fP is normally running (to allow \fBchronyd\fP to re\-read the
file when the \fBrekey\fP command is issued by \fBchronyc\fP).
.RE
.sp
\fBlock_all\fP
.RS 4
The \fBlock_all\fP directive will lock the \fBchronyd\fP process into RAM so that it

The directive is supported on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and illumos.
.RE
.sp
\fBpidfile\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
Unless \fBchronyd\fP is started with the \fB\-Q\fP option, it writes its process ID
(PID) to a file, and checks this file on startup to see if another \fBchronyd\fP
might already be running on the system. By default, the file used is
\fI@DEFAULT_PID_FILE@\fP. The \fBpidfile\fP directive allows the name to be changed,
e.g.:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf

.if n .RE
.sp
Setting this directive to \fI/\fP disables writing and checking of the PID file.
.RE
.sp
\fBptpport\fP \fIport\fP
.RS 4
The \fBptpport\fP directive enables \fBchronyd\fP to send and receive NTP messages
contained in PTP event messages (NTP\-over\-PTP) to enable hardware timestamping
on NICs that cannot timestamp NTP packets, but can timestamp unicast PTP
packets, and also use corrections provided by PTP one\-step end\-to\-end
transparent clocks in network switches and routers. The port recognized by the
NICs and PTP transparent clocks is 319 (PTP event port). The default value is 0
(disabled).
.sp
The NTP\-over\-PTP support is experimental. The protocol and configuration can
change in future. It should be used only in local networks.
.sp
The PTP port will be open even if \fBchronyd\fP is not configured to operate as a
server or client. The directive does not change the default protocol of
specified NTP sources. Each NTP source that should use NTP\-over\-PTP needs to
be specified with the \fBport\fP option set to the PTP port. To actually enable
hardware timestamping on NICs that can timestamp PTP packets only, the
\fBrxfilter\fP option of the \fBhwtimestamp\fP directive needs to be set to \fIptp\fP. The
extension field \fIF324\fP needs to be enabled to use the corrections provided by
the PTP transparent clocks.
.sp

\fBsched_priority\fP \fIpriority\fP

On Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and illumos, the \fBsched_priority\fP directive will

be between 0 and 100). On macOS, this option must have either a value of 0 (the
default) to disable the thread time constraint policy or 1 for the policy to be
enabled.
.sp
On systems other than macOS, this directive uses the \fBpthread_setschedparam()\fP
system call to instruct the kernel to use the SCHED_FIFO first\-in, first\-out
real\-time scheduling policy for \fBchronyd\fP with the specified priority. This
means that whenever \fBchronyd\fP is ready to run it will run, interrupting
whatever else is running unless it is a higher priority real\-time process. This
should not impact performance as \fBchronyd\fP resource requirements are modest,
but it should result in lower and more consistent latency since \fBchronyd\fP will
not need to wait for the scheduler to get around to running it. You should not
use this unless you really need it. The \fBpthread_setschedparam(3)\fP man page has

In this situation, one computer is selected to be the primary timeserver. The

The \fBlocal\fP directive enables a local reference mode, which allows
\fBchronyd\fP to appear synchronised even when it is not.
.sp
The rate value in the server\(cqs drift file needs to be set to the average rate
at which the server gains or loses time. \fBchronyd\fP includes support for this,
in the form of the \fBmanual\fP directive and the
\fBsettime\fP command in the \fBchronyc\fP program.
.sp
If the server is rebooted, \fBchronyd\fP can re\-read the drift rate from the drift
file. The server has no accurate estimate of the current time, however. To get
around this, the system can be configured so that the server can initially set
itself to a \(oqmajority\-vote\(cq of selected clients\*(Aq times; this allows the
clients to \(oqflywheel\(cq the server while it is rebooting.
.sp
The \fBsmoothtime\fP directive is useful when the clocks of the
clients need to stay close together when the local time is adjusted by the
\fBsettime\fP command. The smoothing process needs to be
activated by the \fBsmoothtime activate\fP command when
the local time is ready to be served. After that point, any adjustments will be
smoothed out.
.sp
A typical configuration file for the server (called \fIntp.local\fP) might be

.SS "RTC tracking"
.sp
This section considers a computer that has occasional connections to the
Internet and is turned off between \(oqsessions\(cq. In this case, \fBchronyd\fP relies
on the computer\(cqs RTC to maintain the time between the periods when it is
powered up. It assumes that Linux is run exclusively on the computer. Dual\-boot
systems might work; it depends what (if anything) the other system does to the
RTC. On 2.6 and later kernels, if your motherboard has a HPET, you will need to
enable the \fBHPET_EMULATE_RTC\fP option in your kernel configuration. Otherwise,
\fBchronyd\fP will not be able to interact with the RTC device and will give up
using it.
.sp
When the computer is connected to the Internet, \fBchronyd\fP has access to
external NTP servers that it makes measurements from. These measurements are
saved, and straight\-line fits are performed on them to provide an estimate of
the computer\(cqs time error and rate of gaining or losing time.
.sp
When the computer is taken offline from the Internet, the best estimate of the
gain or loss rate is used to free\-run the computer until it next goes online.
.sp
Whilst the computer is running, \fBchronyd\fP makes measurements of the RTC (via
the \fI/dev/rtc\fP interface, which must be compiled into the kernel). An estimate
is made of the RTC error at a particular RTC second, and the rate at which the
RTC gains or loses time relative to true time.

When the computer is powered down, the measurement histories for all the NTP
servers are saved to files, and the RTC tracking information is also
saved to a file (if the \fBrtcfile\fP directive has been specified).
These pieces of information are also saved if the \fBdump\fP
and \fBwritertc\fP commands respectively are issued
through \fBchronyc\fP.
.sp
When the computer is rebooted, \fBchronyd\fP reads the current RTC time and the RTC
information saved at the last shutdown. This information is used to set the
system clock to the best estimate of what its time would have been now, had it
been left running continuously. The measurement histories for the servers are
then reloaded.
.sp
The next time the computer goes online, the previous sessions\*(Aq measurements can
contribute to the line\-fitting process, which gives a much better estimate of
the computer\(cqs gain or loss rate.
.sp
One problem with saving the measurements and RTC data when the machine is shut
down is what happens if there is a power failure; the most recent data will not
be saved. Although \fBchronyd\fP is robust enough to cope with this, some
performance might be lost. (The main danger arises if the RTC has been changed
during the session, with the \fBtrimrtc\fP command in \fBchronyc\fP. Because of this,
\fBtrimrtc\fP will make sure that a meaningful RTC file is saved after the
change is completed).
.sp
The easiest protection against power failure is to put the \fBdump\fP and
\fBwritertc\fP commands in the same place as the \fBoffline\fP command is issued to
take \fBchronyd\fP offline; because \fBchronyd\fP free\-runs between online sessions, no
parameters will change significantly between going offline from the Internet
and any power failure.
.sp
A final point regards computers that are left running for extended periods and
where it is desired to spin down the hard disc when it is not in use (e.g. when
not accessed for 15 minutes). \fBchronyd\fP has been planned so it supports such
operation; this is the reason why the RTC tracking parameters are not saved to
disc after every update, but only when the user requests such a write, or
during the shutdown sequence. The only other facility that will generate
periodic writes to the disc is the \fBlog rtc\fP facility in the configuration
file; this option should not be used if you want your disc to spin down.
.sp
To illustrate how a computer might be configured for this case, example
configuration files are shown.
.sp
For the \fIchrony.conf\fP file, the following can be used as an example.
.sp
.if n .RS 4

\fBpppd\fP is used for connecting to the Internet. This runs two scripts
\fI/etc/ppp/ip\-up\fP and \fI/etc/ppp/ip\-down\fP when the link goes online and offline
respectively.
.sp
The relevant part of the \fI/etc/ppp/ip\-up\fP file is:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
@BINDIR@/chronyc online
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
and the relevant part of the \fI/etc/ppp/ip\-down\fP script is:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
@BINDIR@/chronyc \-m offline dump writertc
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
\fBchronyd\fP is started during the boot sequence with the \fB\-r\fP and \fB\-s\fP options.
It might need to be started before any software that depends on the system clock
not jumping or moving backwards, depending on the directives in \fBchronyd\fP\*(Aqs
configuration file.
.sp
For the system shutdown, \fBchronyd\fP should receive a SIGTERM several seconds
before the final SIGKILL; the SIGTERM causes the measurement histories and RTC
information to be saved.
.SS "Public NTP server"
.sp
\fBchronyd\fP can be configured to operate as a public NTP server, e.g. to join the
.URL "https://www.pool.ntp.org/en/join.html" "pool.ntp.org" ""
project. The configuration
is similar to the NTP client with permanent connection, except it needs to
allow client access from all addresses. It is recommended to find at least four
good servers (e.g. from the pool, or on the NTP homepage). If the server has a
hardware reference clock (e.g. a GPS receiver), it can be specified by the
\fBrefclock\fP directive.
.sp
The amount of memory used for logging client accesses can be increased in order
to enable clients to use the interleaved mode even when the server has a large
number of clients, and better support rate limiting if it is enabled by the
\fBratelimit\fP directive. The system timezone database, if it is
kept up to date and includes the \fIright/UTC\fP timezone, can be used as a
reliable source to determine when a leap second will be applied to UTC. The
\fB\-r\fP option with the \fBdumpdir\fP directive shortens the time in which
\fBchronyd\fP will not be able to serve time to its clients when it needs to be
restarted (e.g. after upgrading to a newer version, or a change in the
configuration).
.sp
The configuration file could look like:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
server ntp1.example.net iburst
server ntp2.example.net iburst
server ntp3.example.net iburst
