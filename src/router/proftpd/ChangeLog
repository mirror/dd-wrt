	a compiler warning about mismatched printf arguments.

2007-10-04 10:01  castaglia

	* src/env.c: 
	Quell a compiler warning about casting away the const qualifier, on

2007-10-04 09:24  castaglia

	* RELEASE_NOTES: 
	Updating the release notes, preparing for a release.

2007-10-03 19:25  castaglia

	* NEWS, contrib/dist/rpm/ftp.pamd, contrib/dist/rpm/proftpd.spec: 
	Bug#2795 - Improvements to RPM .spec file to build more of the
	modules, plus better optional packaging organization.

2007-10-03 18:46  castaglia

	Correct comment in table.h.

2007-10-02 15:29  castaglia

	Add mention of RFC 2228, and URL, to TLS doc.

2007-10-01 14:41  castaglia

	Update the trace message for the other location in mod_delay where
	the DelayTable is mapped into memory.

	empty/null.

2007-09-30 14:05  castaglia

	* NEWS, src/main.c: Bug#2981 - Command-line long options --ipv4 and
	--ipv6 do not work.

2007-09-27 17:53  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	If an FTP client aborted the data transfer during a directory
	listing, then a 226 response would be sent *twice*, e.g.:
	
	  226 Transfer complete
	  226 Abort successful
	
	would be seen, using the ftp(1) client.  The problem was that
	mod_ls, when closing its data connection, did not check to see if
	the transfer had been aborted.	Aborted transfers should cause the
	data connection to be closed "quietly", i.e. no sending of the
	"Transfer complete" message.
	
	With this change, mod_ls now checks for an aborted transfer, and
	will close the data connection "quietly" when appropriate, thus
	eliminating the duplicate 226 responses.

2007-09-27 17:47  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Cut down on logging an error if errno indicates "success"; usually
	this happens when the client aborted the directory listing.

2007-09-27 09:13  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Add some tracing to aborted transfers.

2007-09-27 09:04  castaglia

	* src/trace.c: 
	Add the 'xfer' channel to the list of default trace channels.

2007-09-25 09:27  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	No need to report on system call errors of "Success".

2007-09-24 19:16  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Allow handling of the PROT command after the CCC command has been
	used.  One particular FTPS client (lftp) is known to send PROT
	(again) after CCC.

2007-09-18 20:22  castaglia

	* doc/howto/TLS.html: 
	Minor formatting tweak.

2007-09-18 20:14  castaglia

	the NoCertRequest TLSOption may help.

2007-09-17 10:36  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/Makefile.in: 
	Bug#2974 - Install error if multiple modules, using their own build
	script, are built as shared modules.

2007-09-14 09:08  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	When handling an EPSV command, close any existing data connection
	first.	Related to Bug #2900.

2007-09-13 14:32  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Just as we don't want to call EVP_cleanup(3) at session
	initialization time if there are other OpenSSL-using modules
	around, we don't want to unload the human-readable OpenSSL error
	strings, either.

2007-09-13 08:25  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Alter the conditions under which mod_tls calls EVP_cleanup(3). 
	Call the function when mod_tls is being unloaded, or when the
	session is exiting, without reservation.  If however the FTP
	session is being initialized, and mod_tls has been compiled but not
	enabled (i.e. the TLSEngine is off or not present), *and* any other
	known OpenSSL using modules (i.e.  mod_ldap and mod_sql) are
	present, do NOT call EVP_cleanup().  Doing so might deprive those
	other modules of OpenSSL functionality unnecessarily.
	
	Patch suggested by Nigel Kukard a while ago.

2007-09-13 08:22  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Adding some logging about various error cases when using OpenSSL
	digests for authentication; these were contributed by Nigel Kukard
	a while ago.

2007-09-13 07:57  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c: 
	Fix compiler warning about redeclaring a variable if Controls

	* doc/howto/Vhost.html: 
	Remove mention of the now-deprecated Bind directive.

2007-09-11 19:24  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	When initializing mod_tls, check the version of the OpenSSL headers
	used against the version of the OpenSSL library used.  Refuse to
	load the module unless the versions match properly.  (This will
	help catch systems where mismatched versions of headers and
	libraries are used inadvertently.)

2007-09-11 15:58  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c: 
	Add trace logging of the succesful loading of modules/files.

2007-09-11 10:47  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	If the admin has specified "UseUTF8 off" in the proftpd.conf file,
	be sure to remove the UTF8 listing from the FEAT output. 
	Otherwise, clients might be a little confused.

2007-09-10 17:52  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Cast the off_t value of total_xfer_bytes properly, and quell
	warnings from picky compilers.

2007-09-10 17:49  castaglia

	* src/log.c: 
	When writing to utmp/wtmp logs, we're really not concerned if we
	fail to truncate the file as requested.

2007-09-10 17:47  castaglia

	* modules/mod_log.c: 
	If there was a problem writing to the ExtendedLog fd, be sure to
	log it using proftpd's logging (and hope that that write()
	succeeds).

2007-09-10 17:44  castaglia

	* modules/mod_delay.c: 
	Inform picky compilers that we will be ignoring the return value
	from write(2).	This may not be the best behavior, but it is what
	we are doing.

2007-09-10 17:42  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Make sure to cast the restart_pos value (an off_t), in order to
	satisfy picky compilers.

2007-09-10 15:55  castaglia

	* contrib/dist/rpm/proftpd.spec: 
	Fix syntax of RPM options for some modules.

2007-08-29 19:00  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Clean up the code style in the xfer_stor() function.  Also add

	* RELEASE_NOTES: 
	Updating the release notes, getting ready for a release.

2007-07-04 11:08  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_wrap2_file.c: 
	A recent innocuous change to mod_wrap2_file turned out to be not so
	innocuous; a static buffer was made non-static, and terror and
	madness ensued.  To fix this (and avoid the distasteful static
	buffer), mod_wrap2_file now makes duplicates of the parsed buffers
	using the table pool (for just such purposes).	This patch also
	cleans up the handling of the service and client lists in the file.

2007-07-02 16:20  jwm

	* contrib/mod_ldap.c: 2.8.17-20070701:	 don't use a separate

2007-06-28 10:41  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Timestamps.html: 
	Add a little more substance to the Timestamps howto, to remind
	readers that they need to think for themselves a little, and read
	their system docs.

2007-06-28 08:52  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c: 
	The clearing of any cached directory config pointers, as a fix for
	Bug #2939, was a little too aggressive.  We only need to clear
	those pointers once, prior to calling setup_env().

2007-06-25 15:55  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_wrap2_file.c: 
	Attempt to log a more informative message if a too-long multiline
	is found.  Also add support for allocating a larger buffer for such
	lines at compile time.

	* NEWS, modules/mod_core.c: 
	Bug#2900 - Some kernels incorrectly reuse IPv6 ports for EPSV

	* modules/mod_facl.c:

2007-05-07 08:35  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_auth.c, modules/mod_core.c, modules/mod_xfer.c:
	
	Bug#2864 - DisplayLogin should work regardless of chroot.  This

	To make this work, the configured Display files must use absolute

	Add more tracing of POSIX ACL functions, particularly on BSD and
	Linux, in order to get better views of errors.	Fix some stupid
	printf format thinkos.	Add function to convert between a mode_t,
	used for access(2), to an acl_perm_t, used for acl_get_perm(2) on
	BSD and Linux.
	
	Hopefully this clears up some of the issues for Bug #2661.

	* modules/mod_facl.c: 
	Fix the initialization of mod_facl's configuration directives. 
	Oops.

2007-04-24 09:12  castaglia

	* src/netio.c: 
	Guard against using negative numbers when calling FD_SET.  The
	FD_SET macro expects an fd, and if that fd is less than zero, the
	results are unpredictable (crashes, silent failures, just works,
	hangs, etc).

2007-04-18 08:31  castaglia

	* modules/mod_facl.c: 
	More tracing of POSIX ACLs on Solaris.	Looks like the
	implementation changed on Solaris 10 for certain filesystems (ZFS,
	NFSv4).

2007-04-17 14:33  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/auth.h, modules/mod_core.c, src/auth.c: 
	Bug#2922 - Auth API allows one auth module to authenticate user
	data provided by a different auth module.

2007-04-17 14:03  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	Include the paths in the trace messages about which FS is used for
	a given filesystem access call.  This will be useful in developing
	and debugging FSIO modules, e.g. mod_facl.

2007-04-15 20:07  castaglia

	* sample-configurations/mod_sql.conf: Do not use 'Plaintext' as a
	example SQLAuthTypes parameter, since too many people blindly copy
	examples as-is, then blame you for the consequences.

2007-04-02 15:22  castaglia

	* src/inet.c: 
	Allow data transfers on low-numbered sockets to work on SCO Unix.

2007-04-02 09:32  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_ls.c, src/data.c: 
	Bug#2911 - NLST on a nonexistent path, followed by an NLST on an
	existing file, causes segfault.

2007-03-27 19:49  castaglia

	* src/parser.c: 
	Cleanup pr_parser_cleanup().  First, return EPERM if the parser
	stack is not in a state when it can be properly cleaned up. 
	Second, reset stack pointers to NULL even when there is no parser
	pool provided.

2007-03-27 19:33  castaglia

	* src/parser.c: 
	Tag the temporary pool right after its creation, not after it has
	been used.

2007-03-27 19:24  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Bug#2913 - TYPE command does not clear ASCII flag from LIST/NLST

	* contrib/mod_rewrite.c: 
	Updating coding style in a few places.	No functional change.

	* config.guess, config.sub, contrib/mod_load/config.guess,
	contrib/mod_load/config.sub, lib/libltdl/config.guess: 
	Updated the config.guess and config.sub scripts, used by the

	Formatting tweaks, no functional change.

2007-03-09 11:01  castaglia

	* sample-configurations/: anonymous.conf, basic.conf,

	Update the example config files to use DisplayChdir, rather than
	the deprecated DisplayFirstChdir directive.

2007-03-09 08:20  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Bar configurations like:
	
	  PassivePorts 2222 2222

	configuration.

2007-03-06 10:30  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updated configure.

2007-02-15 09:54  castaglia

	* lib/pr-syslog.c, src/support.c: 
	Use the feature macro to determine if tzname is actually present to
	be guarded.

2007-02-15 09:52  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in: 
	We're really only concerned with the tzname global variable, not
	with the timezone and daylight global variables.  For now, anyway.

2007-02-15 09:48  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in: 
	Be defensive, and add autoconf detection for the tzname, timezone,
	and daylight global variables.

	Replace calls to localtime(3) throughout the proftpd code with
	calls to pr_localtime().

2007-02-15 08:54  castaglia

	* src/log.c: 
	Missed a call to localtime(3) that needs to replaced with
	pr_localtime().

2007-02-15 08:46  castaglia

	* modules/mod_log.c, src/ftpdctl.c, src/log.c: 
	Update mod_log and the core logging to use pr_localtime(), which
	guards against localtime(3) resetting the tzname global variable to
	an unexpected/wrong timezone (i.e. GMT) in a chrooted process.

2007-02-15 08:43  castaglia

	* src/support.c: 
	Update pr_localtime() so that it no longer requires a pool.  If a
	pool is provided, it will be used, otherwise, the struct tm * from
	localtime(3) will be returned as is.

2007-02-14 17:40  castaglia

	* src/support.c: 
	For functions which use pr_localtime() (and there should be more of
	them), protect the tzname global variable values, to guard against
	localtime(3) twiddling with the tzname variable.  This twiddling
	causes weird values once the process is chrooted.

2007-02-14 17:31  castaglia

	* modules/mod_log.c: 
	Remove a section of code which relies on a macro, HAVE_GMTOFF,
	which has not be defined by proftpd's configure script in who knows
	how long.
	
	This investigation was prompted by looking into Bug #2896.

2007-02-14 17:23  castaglia

	* src/: ftpdctl.c, log.c: 
	When writing to the log fd, check for errors, and specifically try
	the write(2) call again if the call was interrupted.

2007-02-13 08:29  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Forgot to log one of the reasons for not using sendfile():
	UseSendfile set to 'off'.

2007-02-13 08:17  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Add debug logging, level 10, showing when sendfile is used, or
	isn't used.  And if sendfile isn't used, log the reason.

2007-02-13 08:00  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Fix typo.

2007-02-12 11:43  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	A further optimization, suggested by Glenn Nielsen.  In the
	find_best_dir() function, the paths being compared always come from
	c->name, which means that it's actually OK to do direct pointer
	comparison, rather than using strcmp().  Only time will tell
	whether this is a too-clever optimization.

2007-02-12 11:28  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Make some minor optimizations to the dir_match_path() function. 
	Specifically, call strlen() only once when necessary (rather than
	multiple times), and reorder checks such that strcmp() checks, the
	most expensive of the checks, are done *last*, rather than first. 
	The goal is to scan the directory path string as few times as
	possible; given many such directory path strings, each scan adds
	up.

2007-02-12 09:16  castaglia

2007-01-17 18:14  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Update mod_tls to use the pr_env_* functions.  This also eliminates
	a lot of #ifdef PR_USE_DEVEL checks in the mod_tls code -- hooray!

2007-01-17 18:11  castaglia

	* include/env.h, src/env.c: 
	Add some documentation to the pr_env_* functions in the header. 
	Also beef up the code in env.c, such that it is prepared for memory
	checker programs (e.g. Valgrind) in cases where --enable-devel is
	used.  This makes it possible to clean up some ugly #ifdef checks
	elsewhere (e.g.  mod_tls).

2007-01-17 11:50  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Update mod_sql.c to use pr_env_get() rather than getenv(3).

2007-01-17 11:38  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updated configure.

2007-01-17 11:32  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c, configure.in, src/main.c, src/proctitle.c:

	* configure: 
	Updated configure.

2007-01-17 10:34  castaglia

	Add printing of "checking for" messages when scanning for the list
	of usual suspects of lastlog locations.
	
	Related to Bug #2878.

2007-01-17 10:16  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updated configure.

2007-01-17 10:12  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	Fix the configure script to properly use the pr_lastlog_path
	variable (it was using spaces around the '=' operator, which the
	shell may not like).
	
	Part of Bug #2878.

2007-01-17 09:44  castaglia

	* include/lastlog.h: 
	Error out of the build process if PR_LASTLOG_PATH has not been
	defined in one form or another.  Include a slightly more
	informative error message, so that it's better than some cryptic
	compiler error later, when compiling lastlog.c.
	
	Part of the fixes for Bug #2878.

2007-01-17 07:39  castaglia

	* NEWS, src/inet.c: 
	Bug#2877 - ServerType 'inetd' results in "getnameinfo error:

2007-01-16 11:58  castaglia

	* Makefile.in: 
	The -lsupp LIBS flag is now populated in the UTILS_LIBS variable,
	so there is no need for the hardcoded flag as well.

2007-01-16 11:54  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	A bad patch mixed up the ordering of settings displayed via
	show_settings().

2007-01-16 11:53  castaglia

	* src/env.c: 
	Fix bug in pr_env_set() on systems that have putenv(3) rather than
	setenv(3).

2007-01-15 15:55  castaglia

	* configure: Updated configure.

2007-01-15 15:51  castaglia

	* configure.in: Do not scan a mod_foo.h.in file, assuming a
	module-specific subdirectory, for build system hints.  A .in file
	needs to be processed (as via the module's own configure script),
	and should not be scanned until after that processing.

2007-01-12 22:12  castaglia

	* include/proctitle.h, src/main.c, src/proctitle.c: Move the
	proctitle functions into the 'pr_' namespace, just to be safe (and
	consistent).

2007-01-12 20:29  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_quotatab.html: 
	Specify what I mean when I say "groups" and "classes".

2007-01-12 20:16  castaglia

	* include/pidfile.h, src/main.c, src/pidfile.c: 
	Move the pidfile functions into the 'pr_' namespace, so that they
	don't collide with functions of the same names on systems whose
	<libutil.h> system header defines them (with conflicting
	prototypes).  Yay portability.

2007-01-12 20:14  castaglia

	Adding release notes for 1.3.1rc2.

2007-01-12 09:33  castaglia

	* doc/howto/TLS.html: 
	Add a mod_tls FAQ about the "no shared cipher" error.

2007-01-11 23:01  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: In the case of successful chown() and chmod() calls,
	clear the statcache, as the cached data may now be stale.

2007-01-11 21:40  castaglia

	* src/: env.c, pidfile.c, proctitle.c: Correct the license wording
	to mention The ProFTPD Project as primary copyright holder.

2007-01-11 17:30  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, include/conf.h, include/env.h, include/support.h,
	src/env.c, src/support.c: 
	Refactored the pr_env_* routines into their own source and header
	files.

2007-01-11 15:43  castaglia

	* src/ftpdctl.c: 
	Since src/ftpdctl.c has its own copy of sstrcat() and sstrncpy()
	(itself a bad sign), it needs to have the same paranoid checks
	added to those functions as were added to the core implementations.

2007-01-11 15:08  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c: 
	When 'ftpdctl shutdown' is used, include the number of sessions
	being summarily terminated (after a grace period) in the
	ControlsLog message.

2007-01-11 13:36  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, include/conf.h, include/pidfile.h, src/main.c,
	src/pidfile.c: 
	More refactoring of src/main.c.  Now the PID file routines (writing
	and removing the pidfile) are separated out.

2007-01-11 11:16  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, include/conf.h, include/proctitle.h, src/main.c,
	src/proctitle.c: 
	The src/main.c file is a bit hairy mess, and in desperate need of
	refactoring.  This moves the process title functions into their own
	proctitle.c file, with accompanying header.

2007-01-11 10:21  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Another in the series of patches for Bug#2869, this one makes sure
	that sites which use the 'fast' parameter in SQLAuthenticate still
	operate properly.

2007-01-10 20:09  castaglia

	* src/pool.c: 
	The bytes_in_block_list() function should be #ifdef'd as well
	behind PR_USE_DEVEL.

2007-01-10 20:05  castaglia

	* include/compat.h, include/dirtree.h, include/fsio.h,
	include/pool.h, src/dirtree.c, src/fsio.c, src/main.c, src/pool.c: 
	Move a lot of functions, either existing or new, behind
	PR_USE_DEVEL checks, since a lot of functions are meant only for
	the debugging purposes of proftpd developers.  (Hopefully this will
	make the resulting proftpd executable slightly smaller.)  There
	will be more such debugging functions added; they are meant as
	hooks utilized by a mod_debug module (again, only for developer
	use).
	
	The only user-visible change in this is that the SIGUSR2 signal,
	when sent to a proftpd process, would cause that process to print
	out a trace of its memory pool usage.  Now, a SIGUSR2 signal will
	cause an event to be generated -- but the printing of the memory
	pool usage is gone.  I may add that back at some point, if/when
	there is a hue and cry raised.

2007-01-09 20:55  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updated configure.

2007-01-09 19:45  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	Thinko.

2007-01-09 19:19  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, lib/Makefile.in: 
	Put the declarations for ar and ranlib in a place that's visible to
	contrib modules (namely, Make.rules).  Update the lib/Makefile to
	use that location; while I'm at it, remove the stale dependency
	listings from lib/Makefile.

2007-01-09 19:17  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updated configure.

2007-01-09 19:16  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_load/: config.guess, config.sub: 
	The configure script for the mod_load module requires the
	config.sub and config.guess helper scripts.

2007-01-09 19:07  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	Check for the existence of the file before trying to cat it.

2007-01-09 18:25  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updated configure.

2007-01-09 18:19  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, Makefile.in, configure.in: 
	Even more build system magic.  With this change, we add support for
	a new "hint" tag: $Archive$.  This particular tag is *only* honored
	in a very particular situation: the contrib module uses its own
	subdirectory (e.g.  contrib/mod_foo/) *and* that module is being
	built as a static module.  Contrib modules built as shared modules
	fall into different linking rules.
	
	The purpose of this $Archive$ tag is to allow the Makefile for that
	mod_foo module to be built from multiple source files, which would
	result in multiple object files.  All of those object files would
	need to be part of the command to link the final `proftpd'
	executable.  (A shared module would not need to present for this
	link step.)
	
	Rather than have multiple object files from contrib modules, it
	involves less files (though at the cost of more complexity) to use
	a single archive file, e.g. mod_foo.a.	The Makefile for the
	contrib module, for its "static" target, will thus need to assemble
	a mod_foo.a archive from the various .o files.	When this happens,
	the contrib module uses the $Archive$ hint (similar to the
	$Libraries$ hint) to let proftpd's module build system know to
	expect that archive file.

2007-01-09 12:08  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2007-01-09 12:04  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	More build system magic.  This allows contrib module developers,
	who use their own module-specific subdirectory e.g.
	contrib/mod_foo/, to have the $Libraries$ tags in their mod_foo.c,
	mod_foo.h, or mod_foo.h.in files be properly picked up by proftpd's
	build system, just as happens for a module in contrib/mod_foo.c.

2007-01-08 20:19  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2007-01-08 20:16  castaglia

	* contrib/: mod_load/Makefile.in, mod_wrap2/Makefile.in: 
	There's no need to redefine LIBS, then use it in the link command. 
	Just use SHARED_MODULE_LIBS directly, and don't obfuscate the
	matter.

2007-01-08 20:14  castaglia

	* contrib/dist/rpm/proftpd.spec: 
	Add DSO and lastlog support to the RPM spec.

2007-01-08 20:09  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, configure.in, contrib/mod_load/Makefile.in,
	contrib/mod_wrap2/Makefile.in: 
	Tweak the build system so that any LIBS specified on the
	command-line are picked up when building shared modules whose
	sources are in their own directory (e.g. mod_load, mod_wrap2). 
	This may sound like a bit of an edge case, but I suspect that it
	will become a necessity once proftpd supports having contrib
	modules that come with their own message catalogs (i.e. NLS
	support), and thus may need to be linked against the libintl
	library (which provides gettext() support).

2007-01-08 19:31  castaglia

	* src/modules.c: 
	Set errno to EINVAL, when appropriate, in a few places.

2007-01-08 18:14  castaglia

	* src/parser.c: 
	Paranoid checking of signals within a while loop, in case the loop
	should decide to continue endlessly.

2007-01-08 14:59  castaglia

	* src/auth.c: 
	Make sure that dispatch_auth() does not loop endlessly, if there
	are never any ERROR or HANDLED returns from the auth module
	handlers.  Simply keep track of the starting table, and watch the
	iterator table; when the two match, we have looped through the auth
	handlers, and will assume that the entire auth command has been
	DECLINED.

2007-01-08 11:58  castaglia

	* modules/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in, utils/Makefile.in: 
	Remove crufty, outdated, and unnecessary dependency listings.

2007-01-08 11:50  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updated configure.

2007-01-08 11:47  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in, include/support.h, lib/getopt.h: 
	I discovered last night that proftpd's build system was not doing
	as advertised.	Specifically, it continued to build the bundled
	getopt implementation regardless of whether the host system had its
	own getopt support.  (I discovered this on Mac OS X, whose linker
	is apparently more picky that the one on my Linux machine, and
	which was complaining of multiply defined _opt* symbols.)
	
	This changes updates the build system so that it does as stated: if
	the host system does not have getopt support, we use our own.

2007-01-07 22:52  castaglia

	* src/auth.c: Yet another while loop in need of signal handling.

2007-01-07 12:48  castaglia

	* contrib/dist/rpm/proftpd.spec: Add controls support to the RPM
	spec.

2007-01-07 12:42  castaglia

	* contrib/dist/rpm/proftpd.spec: Include the installed header files
	in the RPM spec.
	
	Add ability for specifying mod_quotatab_file.

2007-01-05 19:25  castaglia

	* doc/howto/TLS.html: 
	Add documentation mentioning the CCC command, and how to configure
	mod_tls such that command is allowed for FTPS clients.

2007-01-05 16:07  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	If the TLSRequired setting is such that the control connection
	*cannot* be unprotected, then be sure to deny any CCC commands.

2007-01-03 23:26  castaglia

	* src/support.c: Fix dir_abs_path() such that it does not tack on
	redundant directories to the end of a relative path.

2007-01-03 14:57  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth_file.c: 
	Remember to use PR_DECLINED rather than DECLINED.

2007-01-03 14:06  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth_file.c: 
	Paranoid checking for a NULL return value from crypt(3), just in
	case.  One user's debug logs suggest a segfault in mod_auth_file's
	"check" routine.  Might end up be a red herring, but this code is
	still useful.

2007-01-03 10:24  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Make sure that "SQLAuthenticate groupset" works properly.

2007-01-02 18:54  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in: 
	Make sure the LIBS environment variable is honored when linking the
	utility programs (i.e. ftptop, ftpwho).

2007-01-02 14:27  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_quotatab_ldap.html: 
	Minor clarification.

2006-12-28 09:52  castaglia

	* NEWS, src/mkhome.c: Bug#2872 - CreateHome doesn't recreate
	symlinks from skeleton properly.

2006-12-26 17:59  castaglia

	* src/parser.c: Fix a nasty bug where a <Directory> section which
	contained a <Limit> section, but no other directives, e.g.:
	
	  <Directory /path>
	    <Limit LIST>
	      DenyAll
	    </Limit>
	  </Directory>
	
	was handled as being "empty", and thus ignored; the <Limit> would
	not take effect.

2006-12-22 12:23  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Paranoid NULL termination of vararg lists to the
	sql_prepare_where() variadic function.

2006-12-22 11:52  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Additional work toward Bug #2869, trying to preserve the
	functionality added for Bug #2828.  (That is, make sure that
	variables within the user-defined SQLGroupWhereClause are still
	processed/resolved properly.)

2006-12-22 10:48  castaglia

	* NEWS, contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Bug#2869 - mod_sql botches WHERE clauses.

2006-12-21 14:19  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ratio.c, include/dirtree.h, src/dirtree.c: 
	It's past time to get rid of get_param_int().  This function was
	very naught, and used the size of a void * for storing int values. 
	The rest of the proftpd code has been cleansed of its use (replaced
	with get_param_ptr()); mod_ratio was the last holdout.

2006-12-21 10:01  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	"Temporary" fix has been in place for years; remove the misleading
	comment and commented-out code, since it's proven itself to not be
	needed.

2006-12-20 10:39  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_load/install-sh, contrib/mod_wrap2/install-sh,
	include/install-sh, locale/install-sh, modules/install-sh: 
	For platforms which don't have a standard `install' program, we
	provide the install-sh script.	On those platforms, though, this
	script needs to be in the same directories as the Makefiles which
	use install, rather than just in the top-level directory.

2006-12-20 10:28  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c, src/trace.c: 
	Fixing two issues with this change:
	
	1) Once set in a config file, the Trace/TraceLog directives were
	always	  being honored, even after those directives had been
	removed from the    config file and proftpd restarted.
	
	2) After a restart, the TraceLog fd would often be the same as used
	for    connected clients, with the result that the clients would
	receive    some of the trace log messages.  To address this, we
	need to ensure	  that the TraceLog fd is never one of the major
	three (stdin, stdout,	 or stderr).

2006-12-19 15:54  castaglia

	* src/: parser.c, trace.c: 
	Adding tracing of the parser, using the 'config' trace channel.

2006-12-19 13:36  castaglia

	* src/netaddr.c: 
	More tracing of netaddr functions, particularly in the reverse DNS
	resolution code.

2006-12-18 19:26  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth_pam.c: 
	Adding tracing of PAM.

2006-12-18 19:11  castaglia

	* src/netaddr.c: 
	Adding tracing of netaddr functions, using the trace channel name
	'dns'.

2006-12-18 18:42  castaglia

	* modules/mod_facl.c, src/trace.c: 
	Adding tracing of POSIX ACLs.

2006-12-18 18:38  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_quotatab.c: 
	Make sure we remove mod_quotatab's custom FS, if registered, when
	the module is being unloaded (as a shared module).

2006-12-18 17:29  castaglia

	* NEWS, src/event.c: 
	Bug#2857 - Failure to properly unregister event handlers leads to
	segfault after restarts.
	
	When scanning the lists of event handlers to find the handlers to
	remove, we need to make sure we cover all lists, not short-circuit
	out when we don't find any matching handlers on the first list
	examined.

2006-12-18 15:09  castaglia

	* src/netacl.c: 
	Adding tracing of NetACLs.

2006-12-18 14:43  castaglia

	* src/ident.c: 
	Add tracing of ident lookups.

2006-12-18 12:04  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ban.c: 
	Get in the habit of setting pools to NULL after destroying them.
	
	Update to use newer Timer API.

2006-12-18 11:27  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	The handling of TraceLog was done well; after a restart, the
	TraceLog might very well have opened on a low-numbered fd, one
	assumed to be used for a connecting client.  This means that after
	a restart, connecting clients might inadvertently receive TraceLog
	messages on their client, as if they were FTP response messages
	from proftpd.  Oops.

2006-12-18 10:33  castaglia

	* src/inet.c: 
	FreeBSD 7 on its way.

2006-12-18 10:09  castaglia

	* src/support.c: 
	The pickier compiler on my Linux laptop caught this thinko.

2006-12-17 15:37  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c, modules/mod_log.c, src/parser.c: Use
	pr_env_get() rather than getenv(3).

2006-12-17 15:28  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_wrap2/mod_wrap2.c, modules/mod_auth.c,
	modules/mod_core.c: Update modules to use pr_env_set() rather than
	setenv().  This is mostly for the benefit of systems which may
	provide putenv() rather than setenv().

2006-12-17 15:27  castaglia

	* configure: Updated configure.

2006-12-17 15:24  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in, include/support.h, src/support.c:
	Rather than using setenv(3) and unsetenv(3) directly, provide
	pr_env() wrappers.  This is particularly useful for Solaris
	systems, which may not provide setenv(3) but *do* provide
	putenv(3); pr_env_set() handles this transparently.  (If present,
	setenv(3) is used, otherwise if putenv(3) is present, that is used,
	otherwise ENOSYS.)

2006-12-15 17:13  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ctrls.c, src/ctrls.c: 
	Add tracing of controls.

2006-12-15 15:24  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c: 
	Adding tracing of DSO modules.

2006-12-15 15:10  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html: 
	Documentation for the 'trace info' ftpctl action.

2006-12-15 15:07  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c: 
	Fix the handling of a 'trace info' control action, so that the list
	of trace channels and their respective log levels is comprehensibly
	displayed.

2006-12-15 14:32  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	Add more handling of possible signals within while() loops.

2006-12-15 14:25  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Style changes, and some additional pr_signals_handle() calls in
	while() loops.

2006-12-15 14:17  castaglia

	* src/event.c: 
	Use tracing for logging of events, rather than debug logging.

2006-12-15 11:49  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	Add tracing of the FSIO API, no longer using pr_log_debug().

2006-12-15 11:35  castaglia

	* src/auth.c: 
	Moving more logging out of the main error log, and into the
	TraceLog.  A lot of this level detail isn't always necessary.

2006-12-15 11:32  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html: 
	Add docs for the 'trace' control action.

2006-12-15 11:05  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_core.c: 
	Bug#2849 - Error msg "Not owner" returned by "SIZE in ASCII mode"
	is misleading.

2006-12-15 10:51  castaglia

	* src/utf8.c: 
	Make sure that utf8_init() and utf8_free() are present for use by
	the linker, even if they return ENOSYS.

2006-12-15 10:46  castaglia

	* lib/getopt.c: 
	Make sure to reference the gettext() function only when NLS support
	has been requested.  Otherwise, confusing linker errors result.

2006-12-14 16:21  castaglia

	* src/timers.c: 
	Add timer tracing.

2006-12-14 16:06  castaglia

	* include/: compat.h, timers.h: 
	Compatibility macros should all be collected in compat.h.

2006-12-14 15:15  castaglia

	* locale/Makefile.in: 
	Using the --sort-by-file option when generating message catalogs.

2006-12-14 15:12  castaglia

	* modules/mod_delay.c: 
	Move a lot of the debug logging in mod_delay out of proftpd's main
	error log into the TraceLog using tracing.

2006-12-14 14:18  castaglia

	* src/inet.c: 
	Use tracing to log when we have successfully bound an address/port
	to a socket.

2006-12-14 08:37  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updated configure.

2006-12-14 08:27  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, Makefile.in, configure.in: 
	The utilities (ftptop, ftpwho, etc) also need to be linked with
	libintl, if NLS support is enabled and libintl is present.

2006-12-13 14:54  castaglia

	* NEWS, contrib/mod_radius.c, doc/contrib/mod_radius.html: 
	Bug#2856 - Support for RADIUS NAS-Identifier attribute.

2006-12-13 10:19  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updated configure.

2006-12-13 10:16  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	Better checking for the required libintl support when --enable-nls
	is selected.  If the requisite functions (e.g. bindtextdomain(),
	gettext()) aren't found in libintl, then libc is checked.  If not
	there either, then configure will abort.

2006-12-13 10:04  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Use strcoll(3) both when NLS is enabled and when strcoll(3) is
	actually present.

2006-12-13 09:44  castaglia

	* modules/mod_lang.c: 
	Make sure that mod_lang can compile if libintl support is absent.

2006-12-13 09:40  castaglia

	* src/utf8.c: 
	Make sure utf8.c can compile and run, even when iconv support is
	lacking.

2006-12-12 10:44  castaglia

	* doc/modules/mod_delay.html: 
	Typo.

2006-12-12 10:24  castaglia

	* include/version.h: 
	Back to CVS mode, for the next RC release.

2006-12-12 09:02  castaglia

	* ChangeLog: 
	Updated ChangeLog.

2006-12-12 09:00  castaglia

	* NEWS, contrib/dist/rpm/proftpd.spec, include/version.h: 
	Preparing for 1.3.1rc1 release.

2006-12-12 08:52  castaglia

	* RELEASE_NOTES: 
	Finish polishing up these release notes.

2006-12-12 08:34  castaglia

	* NEWS, src/ctrls.c: 
	Bug#2867 - Local authorized user buffer overflow in Controls
	request handling.

2006-12-11 15:11  castaglia

	* src/var.c: 
	Handle the case where the retrieved variable is NULL.

2006-12-11 14:42  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	More pedantic checks for NULL pointers.

2006-12-11 14:40  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Use pr_log_debug() to handle cases where the database-specific SQL
	backend module is chosen, as a SQLLogFile may not have been opened
	at the time of backend selection.

2006-12-11 13:45  castaglia

	* doc/howto/TLS.html: 
	Add a mod_tls FAQ about linker errors related to libdl.

2006-12-11 12:06  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	More safety checking of possibly NULL return values.

2006-12-11 11:58  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Move the check for a NULL path earlier, before we actually try to
	use path by calling pr_fsio_fstat() on it.

2006-12-11 11:53  castaglia

	* src/log.c: 
	Handle a possible return value of NULL from localtime(3).

2006-12-11 11:05  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	Check for NULL return values from strdup(3).

2006-12-11 10:59  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Paranoid checks for NULL pointers, to ensure we don't accidentally
	pass them to library functions (e.g. strstr(3) or substr(3)).

2006-12-11 09:07  castaglia

	* src/trace.c: 
	Off by one.

2006-12-11 09:03  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c, modules/mod_ls.c, modules/mod_site.c: 
	Off by one.

2006-12-11 00:20  castaglia

	* lib/glibc-glob.c: Paranoid null pointer check.  Useful, since we
	do use the ALTDIRFUNC flag.

2006-12-11 00:12  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: Make sure pr_fs_dircat() doesn't attempt to operate
	on NULL pointers.

2006-12-11 00:02  castaglia

	* modules/mod_log.c: More insurance that a possible NULL value
	isn't passed to a library call, e.g. strftime(3).

2006-12-10 23:59  castaglia

	* modules/mod_log.c: Ensure we don't inadvertently attempt to
	lookup a NULL environment variable name, or copy a NULL environment
	variable value.

2006-12-10 23:55  castaglia

	* src/trace.c: Paranoid check for improper indices into the
	allocated buffer.

2006-12-10 23:52  castaglia

	* src/support.c: Ensure that we don't accidentally go past the end
	of the allocated array.

2006-12-10 23:40  castaglia

	* modules/mod_site.c: Another possible negative array index catch.

2006-12-10 23:37  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: Catch another possible situation where the
	index used may inadvertently be -1.

2006-12-10 23:21  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: Pedantically fix some edge cases where an index of -1
	might accidentally be used.

2006-12-07 09:18  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	I think that the majority of sites don't use Classes so much, so
	move the log message about connections from unknown classes up a
	few debug log levels.

2006-12-06 16:10  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	If sorting of directory listings by file name is requested, and NLS
	support is enabled, be sure to use the locale-sensitive strcoll(3)
	function for comparison, rather than strcmp(3).

2006-12-06 10:56  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updated configure.

2006-12-06 10:55  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in, include/conf.h: 
	NLS support requires checking for the locale.h header, and
	including it if necessary.

2006-12-05 21:15  castaglia

	* doc/howto/DisplayFiles.html: 
	Renamed DisplayFirstChdir to DisplayChdir, and added mention of the
	new DisplayFileTransfer.

2006-12-05 20:29  castaglia

	* include/display.h, src/display.c: 
	Add the ability to display files via filehandles, using
	pr_display_fh(), in addition to displaying files via paths using
	pr_display_file().
	
	Why would we want pr_display_fh()?  Many sites, especially those
	with lots of users, like DisplayLogin, but they also want to chroot
	their users.  The handling of DisplayLogin could be changed to open
	a filehandle prior to the chroot, if necessary, and thus continue
	to display a file whilst allowing chrooted users.  That's the goal,
	anyway.

2006-12-05 20:22  castaglia

	* src/display.c: 
	Use tracing, rather than debug level 10, for logging about
	unresolved variables in Display files.

2006-12-05 20:21  castaglia

	* src/trace.c: 
	Add a default trace channel for logging from the Variables API
	layer.

2006-12-05 20:05  castaglia

	* lib/sstrncpy.c: 
	Include the library support header libsupp.h, at least, since that
	is what its purpose is.

2006-12-05 19:57  castaglia

	* lib/sstrncpy.c: 
	No need to pull in all of proftpd's configuration for sstrncpy().

2006-12-05 13:44  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_wrap2/mod_wrap2.c: 
	More updates to the current APIs.

2006-12-05 12:05  castaglia

	* contrib/: mod_ban.c, mod_wrap2/mod_wrap2.c: 
	Updating mod_ban, mod_wrap2 to use newer module API names and
	macros.

2006-12-05 11:00  castaglia

	* include/log.h: 
	Use GCC pragmas for checking callers of pr_log_writefile() as well.

2006-12-05 10:54  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Since the sendline() arguments were giving us such trouble, I
	decided to make use of GCC's attribute pragma to warn about
	printf-like functions, as is done in other places in the proftpd

	logging, depending on the mod_tls configuration.

2006-12-04 14:33  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Rather than logging when CRLs have not been configured, log when
	CRLs *are* present and being used.

2006-12-04 14:31  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	More paranoia.	Also some minor style changes.

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Increase the size of the buffer used to log X509 names from the

	If the client certificate cannot be verified because of an invalid
	purpose, log the purposes of the client certificate.

2006-12-04 13:56  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	X509_STORE_CTX_init() did not return a value in versions of OpenSSL

	Also conditionalize the use of the tls_crypto_device variable as
	per supporting OpenSSL version.

2006-12-04 11:31  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Correct one case where sendline() was being called with two format
	parameters but only one argument (led to garbage being sent to
	client in directory listing).  Also, make sure that all callers of

	library.

2006-12-01 18:13  castaglia

	catalog for translation.

2006-11-30 14:31  castaglia

	(Also add entry for Bug #2858.)

2006-11-28 19:47  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Prevent some possible NULL pointer dereferences by checking for
	tls_pkey before using it.
	
	Use root privileges when checking for the existence of certificate
	and key files, during the config handler runs.	These files are
	opened with root privs later in the module, so the checks for the
	existence should also use root privs.

2006-11-28 19:29  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_radius.c: 
	Fix typo in declaration of static MD5_Update() function.
	
	Also add paranoid check for size of attribute length, in RADIUS
	packet, which exceeds the maximum size of the data type.

2006-11-28 11:37  jwm

	* src/support.c: use the version that was released as part of
	1.3.0a; these integer "overflows" aren't exploitable, so there is
	no prophylactic difference

2006-11-27 06:49  jwm

2006-10-31 19:12  castaglia

	* lib/glibc-glob.c: 
	Catch a few cases, from code borrowed from glibc, where the return

	Prevent sstrcat() and sstrncpy() from working on buffers if the
	length argument is zero.

2006-10-31 18:36  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Since readlink(2) is not guaranteed to NUL-terminate the provided
	buffer, we need to save space for the NUL terminator.

2006-10-31 18:35  castaglia

	* src/netio.c: 
	Require that callers of pr_netio_gets() and pr_netio_telnet_gets()

	* src/parser.c: 
	Typo.

2006-10-13 07:51  castaglia

	* src/parser.c: 
	If we don't find an end-of-line marker (LF or CRLF) in the line of

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	When determining the backend database module to use, mod_sql was
	using the *first* entry in the list of backends, rather than the
	*last*, as is documented.  Updated the default behavior to properly
	use the last entry (which is the first module loaded).

2006-08-17 09:05  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Fix an issue noticed by Daniel, using lftp (but not ftp).
	
	When handling an NLST command on an empty directory, lftp would
	receive a TCP RST from proftpd, rather than the more polite FIN. 
	This would happen because proftpd did a lazy opening of the data
	connection; the connection would be opened only when proftpd, when
	listing the contents of the directory, encountered something to
	list.  In the case of an empty directory, there would be nothing to
	list.  Hence no accept(2) for the client's data connection,
	followed by a close() on the socket.  In the TCP world, this is
	"slamming the connection closed", and hence the client would
	receive a RST -- the initial handshake was not completed before the
	socket was closed.
	
	The fix, then, is trivial: always open the data connection,
	regardless of whether there is data to be sent, when handling NLST
	commands.  (For some reason this issue does not seem to affect the
	LIST command.)

	* configure.in: 
	Fix the --without-getopt configure option so that it properly
	disables checks for the getopt_long() function and getopt.h header,
	in addition to disabling the check for the getopt() function.  This
	was causing a problem on FreeBSD 4.x builds, where the libgnugetopt

	configure script) that had a conflicting redefinition of the getopt
	struct.

	* configure.in: 
	Fix a bug, reported via the Debian bug system, where the paths from
	which proftpd would look for shared libraries included the
	--sbindir.
	
	The issue was the use of the -rpath linker parameter when linking
	the proftpd executable; it is not necessary.  Loading of DSO
	modules does not seem to be affected by the removal of that -rpath.

2006-05-22 09:45  castaglia

2006-01-04 05:31  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Fix a warning about an unused variable.  The tcp_level variable is

	Mention the OSX tweaks in the Release Notes.

2005-12-26 19:04  castaglia

	* src/main.c: Initialise the session.proc_prefix string upon client
	connection.  There was a strange edge case, involving
	mod_wrap-2.0.x, where proftpd was calling set_proc_title() using a
	NULL session.proc_prefix.  GNU libc handles printfs of NULLs
	gracefully, but other libc implementations (e.g. Solaris) are not
	as forgiving; this edge case was leading to segfaults on those
	platforms.

2005-12-02 10:34  jwm

	* contrib/mod_ldap.c: some overdue cleanup: - use braces
	everywhere. honestly, i don't know why i wrote code this way.  -
	now that we're using strtoul() sanity checking on default [UG]IDs,
	we   don't need the isdigit() checking - use get_param_ptr for
	single-argument directives instead of find_config() - if a
	directive is present (get_param_ptr() returns non-NULL), assign its
	  value to the config variable; we don't want to assume default
	values	 in the variable initialization as well as the getconf
	handler.

2005-12-02 09:04  jwm

	* contrib/mod_ldap.c: - complain about invalid default [UG]IDs -
	only allocate enough arguments in the config_rec for LDAPDoAuth and
	  LDAPDoUIDLookups to cover the arguments specified

2005-12-02 08:51  jwm

	* contrib/mod_ldap.c: - remove get_param_int() usage; store values
	in an allocated pointer intsead - config handlers now take their
	directive name from c->argv[0], saving	 a few bytes of static
	strings

2005-11-14 08:33  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/pr-syslog.h, lib/pr-syslog.c, src/log.c: 
	Bug#2705 - proftpd fails to log anything to syslog after dropping
	privs on Solaris.
	
	Since proftpd has custom syslog routines, we can simply add an
	accessor function for setting the static log_facility variable. 
	libc-based syslogging cannot do this; proftpd used libc syslog
	routines in the past, hence the need to call openlog() again if the
	facility changed.
	
	Thanks to Kostantinos Koukopoulos for the patch.

2005-11-12 10:25  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_core.c:

	Drat.  Forgot to replace all occurrences of ->readlink() with
	pr_fsio_readlink().

2005-10-26 09:53  castaglia

	* modules/mod_facl.c: 
	Use direct pointer assignment rather than acl_copy_entry(); the
	latter is not needed.  Patch supplied by Patrick McHardy.

2005-10-26 09:34  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	When cleaning the path in pr_insert_fs(), only add a trailing path
	separator if the original path had one _and_ the current cleaned
	path does _not_ have one.  Thanks to Patrick McHardy for pointing
	this out.

2005-10-26 09:19  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	Patrick McHardy pointed out that in a couple of places, the FSIO
	API uses the readlink function pointer, registered for an fs_t,
	directly.  However, it is not required for registered fs_ts to
	provide any particular FSIO function.  Thus pr_fsio_readlink(),
	which iterates through the fs layers in order to find the first
	that does provide a readlink function, should be used.

2005-10-23 14:50  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Fix a segfault expanding the '%h' sequence for an SQLLog EXIT
	command by using the proper API.  Related to Bug #2695.

2005-10-20 08:33  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_tls.html: 
	Fixed example installation instructions for mod_tls.

2005-10-19 16:33  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2005-10-19 16:28  castaglia

	* configure.in, config.h.in, include/ctrls.h, modules/mod_ctrls.c,
	src/ctrls.c: 
	Change the location of the logic used to determine whether the
	platform prefers S_ISFIFO or S_ISSOCK for detecting Unix domain
	sockets.  Rather than using a test program as part of the configure
	script, move the check into the init_ctrls() code, so that it can
	be done at run-time.

2005-10-18 16:27  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c, modules/mod_log.c: 
	Fix handling of the %f log variable for the RNTO command.  Both
	mod_log and mod_sql were using session.xfer.path for %f, when in
	the case of RNTO, the %f that is desired is actually the argument
	of the command, cmd->arg, not session.xfer.path.

2005-10-18 11:30  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c, modules/mod_log.c: 
	When expanding the %J log variable (for command arguments), be sure
	to hide the arguments for the PASS command.

2005-10-10 10:58  castaglia

	* README.IPv6, src/netacl.c: 
	Only use the full range of characters which appear in an IPv6 (and
	IPv4) address when IPv6 support is enabled.
	
	Also, document the case where, when IPv6 support *is* enabled,
	certain DNS names are not handled as one would expect, due to the
	heuristics used by the ACL parser.

2005-10-08 13:51  castaglia

	* RELEASE_NOTES, doc/howto/Filters.html, doc/howto/Regex.html,

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2005-10-08 13:14  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in, modules/mod_ctrls.c: 
	Add an autoconf check to see if the platform prefers S_ISFIFO or
	S_ISSOCK for Unix domain sockets.  It seems that some systems (e.g.
	UnixWare) prefer S_ISFIFO, even though the file is created/bound
	using socket(2)/bind(2) rather than mknod(2).  Isn't portability
	grand.
	
	The added test defines a PR_ISSOCK_UNIX macro, defined to the
	appropriate S_IS* macro, for use in proftpd code.

2005-09-20 18:04  castaglia

	Use of the StdEnvVars TLSOption does not necessarily increase the

	* src/fsio.c: 
	After cleaning the path given to pr_insert_fs(), we make sure it

	When reporting on use or nonuse of <IfModule> and <IfDefine>
	sections, correctly report the "!" character.  Otherwise, the
	reporting is confusing.

2005-08-07 09:01  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	When handling any error returned by SSL_shutdown(3) (after it has
	been called the second time), and the error is not explicitly
	handled by the switch statement, log the error code.  This will
	help in debugging certain cases where tls_get_error() returns

	* NEWS: 
	Bug#2667 - mod_tls handles SIGHUP badly.  Stop registering the
	handler for the "core.postparse" event in the "core.restart" event
	handler; such multiple registrations cause the "core.postparse"
	event handler to be invoked multiple times.

2005-07-30 18:25  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	The "core.restart" event handler for mod_tls was registering a
	handler for the "core.postparse" event; however, one was already
	being registered.  The duplicate "core.postparse" registrations
	would cause the handler to be called repeatedly, leading to locking
	of key passphrases into memory multiple times and other unintended
	funniness.

2005-07-07 00:10  castaglia

	* modules/mod_log.c: 
	With the fixing of Bug #1965, the mod_log module no longer needs a
	PRE_CMD handler in order to properly log the QUIT command; the
	POST_CMD C_ANY handler suffices.  In fact, the PRE_CMD C_QUIT
	handler currently in place means that the QUIT command would be
	logged twice in an ExtendedLog.

2005-07-03 11:13  castaglia

	* NEWS: 
	Bug#2375 - Slow directory listing with several blank .ftpaccess
	files.

2005-07-03 11:08  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	When parsing .ftpaccess files, check that the size of the
	.ftpaccess file is non-zero before handling it.  This is related to
	Bug #2375, if not _the_ culprit.  I suspect that there are more
	improvements to be made with regards to .ftpaccess file processing,
	though.

2005-07-02 11:41  castaglia

	* NEWS, contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Fix segfault where using SQLLog to execute a SQLNamedQuery (which
	uses %L or %a) for the EXIT command would attempt to use freed
	memory.

2005-07-02 11:06  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Set the current working directory, in the FSIO layer, before an
	open() call.  This may be the cause of some strange behaviors seen
	with some of my FSIO modules (i.e. mod_md5).

2005-07-02 10:59  castaglia

	* modules/mod_delay.c: 
	More bounds checking in mod_delay, as part of an investigation into
	Bug #2621 using valgrind.

2005-06-29 17:39  castaglia

	* NEWS, contrib/mod_sql_mysql.c: 
	Bug#2644 - mod_sql_mysql should handle old MySQL password format

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2005-06-26 22:25  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in: 
	Check for the size of a time_t.  We do not need this immediately,
	but we will soon.

2005-06-23 16:23  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_quotatab_sql.c: 
	Fix a rather broken assignment.  Newer versions of gcc, being less
	lenient, choke on this assignment whereas older versions of gcc let
	it pass.

2005-06-22 13:56  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Always set the tls_pkey_list pointer to NULL after scrubbing the
	list.  Also, be sure to scrub that list at session initialization
	time if TLSEngine is not on for the session.

2005-06-22 10:22  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	The changes in the FSIO API to support chained FS objects changed
	some things; the lookup_file_fs() function made assumptions which
	were broken by those changes.  Update lookup_file_fs() to properly
	deal with FS objects whose stat or lstat function pointers may be
	NULL.

2005-06-21 18:58  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	Off by one in my calculation; PR_TUNABLE_PATH_MAX-1 is the last
	usable index in the buffer.  Of course, I may still be wrong here,
	but I'd rather be wrong by too large of a difference, rather than
	too small.

2005-06-21 16:11  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	Tracking down a bug in my crufty mod_md5fs module revealed the
	cause to be a subtle bug in pr_insert_fs().  The path provided by
	the caller was being cleaned via pr_fs_clean_path(), which would
	remove any trailing path separators.  However, in the case of FSIO
	FS objects, that trailing separator is important.  Re-add it if it
	was there.

2005-06-21 15:06  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Update configure.

2005-06-21 13:54  castaglia

	* src/bindings.c: 
	The ipv6_supported variable need only be defined if --enable-ipv6
	is used.

2005-06-21 11:49  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	If the --enable-ctrls configure option is used, mod_ctrls will be
	built as a static module.  To get mod_ctrls to be built as a shared
	module, use --enable-ctrls and list mod_ctrls in the --with-shared
	list.  However, I have not tested how well mod_ctrls behaves as a
	shared module...

2005-06-21 11:27  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Display the default libexec/ directory for the -V option, if DSO
	support is enabled.

2005-06-21 10:22  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2005-06-21 10:02  castaglia

	* configure.in, src/bindings.c: 
	Undo yesterday's autoconf change for IPv6 support detection. 
	Instead, move that detection into init_bindings(), although I
	suspect that it will be needed in other places of the code as well.
	 At least this way, though, a proftpd compiled using --enable-ipv6
	on an IPv4 box will still start up properly and accept connections.

2005-06-21 06:54  castaglia

	* NEWS: 
	Update the description of Bug #2573, making note of the changed
	behavior and how to address it (as per Bug #2640).

2005-06-20 15:57  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2005-06-20 15:35  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	Have autoconf check for IPv6 support when the --enable-ipv6
	configure option is used.  It is completely possible for an
	IPv4-only box to be used to compile a proftpd configured using
	--enable-ipv6.	When that proftpd is started on the IPv4-only box,
	it would choke inexplicably.  This is due to changes made for Bug
	#2758.

2005-06-20 15:16  castaglia

	* src/netaddr.c: 
	Log when we are looking for IPv4 addresses via DNS, and when we're
	looking for IPv6 addresses.

2005-06-19 22:41  castaglia

	* src/mkhome.c: 
	Make sure to reset the umask in the case where mkdir() could fail. 
	Otherwise, the umask of the process will be left in the wrong
	state.

2005-06-19 19:05  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_ifsession.html: 
	Updating mod_ifsession docs.

2005-06-18 14:05  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	OpenSSL 0.9.8 changed some macro names (and did not document it
	*sigh*).  Update mod_tls to use the new names as necessary.

2005-06-18 11:16  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_delay.c: 
	Bug#2630 - Use of mmap in mod_delay may be problematic on HP-UX.

2005-06-16 14:27  castaglia

	* include/table.h, src/table.c: 
	Add a new table flag, PR_TABLE_FL_USE_CACHE.  By default, this flag
	is off.  The caching behavior of previously-looked up keys in the
	table accessors was a bit confusing (which itself indicates the
	need for better table documentation).  Make use of that lookup
	cache disabled by default, so that the behavior is least surprising
	to developers.	Callers that require higher performance tables can
	enable the flag as needed.

2005-06-16 11:58  castaglia

	* src/table.c: 
	Added some missing pr_signals_handle() calls in while loops.

2005-06-15 10:38  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Bug#2639 - HiddenStores does not work.

2005-06-15 08:40  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Set a valid errno for pr_is_boolean().

2005-06-14 11:11  castaglia

	* src/auth.c: 
	Add debugging, level 10, of retrieved user/group names and
	UIDs/GIDs, similar to what is done during in pr_auth_getgroups().

2005-06-13 18:23  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_radius.c, contrib/mod_sql.c, contrib/mod_tls.c,
	include/compat.h, include/log.h, modules/mod_core.c,
	modules/mod_ctrls.c, modules/mod_log.c, src/log.c, src/xferlog.c: 
	Move the LOG_* macros (for indicating writable dirs, symlinks, and
	permission modes) into the PR_ namespace.  Provide compatibility
	macros for source compatibility for other modules, for now.

2005-06-13 15:01  castaglia

	* include/log.h, modules/mod_core.c, modules/mod_log.c, src/log.c: 
	Move the log_str2sysloglevel() function into the 'pr_' namespace.

2005-06-13 09:27  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_xfer.c, src/data.c: 
	Bug#2636 - Data connection failure when handling STOR does not
	trigger error response.

2005-06-11 21:42  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Bug#2637 - <Limit STAT> does not work.

2005-06-11 17:36  castaglia

	* include/: compat.h, dirtree.h: 
	Moving some macro (name redefinitions) into the more appropiate
	compat.h header.

2005-06-11 16:46  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Style consistency and cleanup.

2005-06-11 15:18  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Comment typo.

2005-06-10 10:21  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c, include/auth.h, modules/mod_auth.c,
	src/auth.c: 
	Removing the overloaded use of pr_auth_authenticate() in mod_auth
	for allowing RFC2228 modules to authenticate a user using non-PASS
	means.
	
	Instead, there is a new Auth API function, pr_auth_requires_pass().
	 All modules have a chance to provide handlers for this auth
	command; if any module can successfully authenticate the client
	without requiring the PASS command, then pr_auth_requires_pass()
	will return FALSE.  If and only if pr_auth_requires_pass() returns
	FALSE will mod_auth send the 232 response code to the client,
	indicating that no PASS command is required.

2005-06-10 10:06  castaglia

	* NEWS, lib/pr-syslog.c: 
	Bug#2632 - Invalid application of `sizeof' to an incomplete type on

	Bug#2631 - Segfault when using RadiusAcctServer.

2005-06-08 09:21  castaglia

	* doc/howto/SQL.html: 
	Grgoire COLBERT contributed a snippet of PHP code that can be used
	to generate base64-encoded MD5-digested password strings, suitable
	for use by mod_sql.

2005-06-07 11:58  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_radius.c: 
	Minor style cleanup.

2005-06-06 10:45  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_rewrite.html: 
	No need for the trailing /, as the closing } serves as the
	delimiter.

2005-06-06 10:40  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_rewrite.html: 
	The example RewriteRule directive provided had a problem.  One of
	its parameters contained an embedded whitespace, and the example
	did not enclose that parameter in quotations, which meant that the
	config parser would split that parameter incorrectly.

2005-06-05 11:26  castaglia

	* NEWS, README.FreeBSD: 
	Bug#2250 - Add ports, compiling info to FreeBSD README.

2005-06-05 11:20  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/fsio.h: 
	Bug#2624 - "fh_data" macro collision causes compiler error on Tru64
	V5.1A.

2005-06-02 08:25  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_radius.c: 
	Since mod_radius is distributed with the proftpd source, it should
	not have an "RC" version.  It will now be officially version 0.8.

2005-06-01 21:43  castaglia

	* modules/mod_delay.c: 
	Bug#2622 - Segfault seen randomly in mod_delay.
	
	This patch changes the bounds check for the j variable, which is
	decrementing, to be as necessary.

2005-06-01 16:21  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Add better logging of when PORT, PASV, EPRT, and EPSV are denied
	because of <Limit> configurations.  Minor code style changes.

2005-06-01 14:07  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_radius.html: 
	Remove extraneous space.

2005-06-01 14:03  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_radius.html: 
	Updating mod_radius documentation.

2005-06-01 13:52  castaglia

	* README.Solaris2.5x: 
	Use "ProFTPD", not "ProFTP".

2005-06-01 13:50  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_radius.c: 
	More strict checking of the number of parameters for the RadiusLog
	directive.
	
	In general, this a problem with the CHECK_ARGS macro.  It allows >=
	n parameters, where it should check strictly for == n.

2005-06-01 10:21  castaglia

	Bug#2601 - mod_delay sometimes delays for a long time.

2005-05-20 19:16  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c: 
	If we are unable to resolve a user's home directory, try to
	interpolate it (as when the home dir is "~"), in order to provide a
	more informative log message to the admin.  This will greatly help
	in debugging.

	Eliminated the need for Solaris users to do anything special when

2005-01-01 11:39  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_load/: configure.in, getloadavg.c, mod_load.c,
	mod_load.c.in: 
	Modified the configure script to detect when additional libraries
	are needed, and to generate mod_load.c from mod_load.c.in, with the
	$Libraries$ tag properly populated.
	
	Note that newer autoconf treatment of the AC_FUNC_GETLOADAVG macro
	requires that a getloadavg.c file be present, even if empty.  How
	annoying.

2005-01-01 11:13  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_load/mod_load.c: 
	No need for mod_load's getloadavg() function to be visible outside
	of the source file.

2005-01-01 11:02  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_load/mod_load.c: 
	Fix some compiler warnings about formats.
	
	Add an empty $Libraries$ tag.  Soon, mod_load's configure script
	will process the mod_load source, and substitute in a list of
	libraries that mod_load conditionally requires (e.g. libkstat on
	Solaris).

2005-01-01 10:55  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ifsession.c:

	Support being unloaded as a shared module.

2004-12-16 15:26  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_radius.c: 
	Add code to support being unloaded as a shared module.

2004-12-16 14:55  castaglia

	* contrib/: mod_quotatab.c, mod_quotatab.h, mod_quotatab_file.c,
	mod_quotatab_ldap.c, mod_quotatab_sql.c: 
	Add a new quotatab_unregister_backend() function to the
	mod_quotatab API, and rename quotatab_register() to
	quotatab_register_backend().  This makes it consistent with
	mod_sql's backend API, and also makes it possible to unregister a
	quotatab backend module.
	
	Adds support for graceful unloading of mod_quotatab et al as shared
	modules.

2004-12-16 11:38  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Add code to mod_tls to support being unloaded as a shared module.

2004-12-16 10:33  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c, src/main.c: 
	Rather than having the core engine unload modules during a restart,
	have them unloaded by mod_dso.	That's only fair, since a) mod_dso
	was responsible for loading the modules in the first place, and b)
	mod_dso also handles the unloaded of the handles from libltdl,
	about which the core engine knows nothing.

2004-12-16 10:17  castaglia

	* contrib/: mod_sql.c, mod_sql_mysql.c, mod_sql_postgres.c: 
	Tweak the SQL modules to better handle being built as shared
	modules.

2004-12-16 10:13  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	During a restart (e.g. SIGHUP), unload all non-static modules, i.e.
	all shared modules that have been dynamically loaded.  This is to
	handle the case where an admin removes a LoadModule directive from
	proftpd.conf, then issues a SIGHUP.
	
	Note that this requires changes to shared modules, to make sure
	they unload themselves properly.  Such changes for the contrib/
	modules will follow shortly.

2004-12-15 19:01  castaglia

	* include/event.h, src/event.c: 
	Tweak the Event API to allow blanket unregistration of all a
	module's event listeners in one pr_event_unregister() call.
	
	Gracefully avoid a possible segfault during pr_event_register().

2004-12-15 18:30  castaglia

	* src/auth.c: 
	'login' is a global variable somewhere, so compiling under
	--enable-devel kicks up compiler warnings.

2004-12-15 18:23  castaglia

	* Makefile.in: 
	The shell's test function prefers to operate on single strings, so
	enclose the expanded $SHARED_MODULE_OBJS list within quotations.

2004-12-15 16:54  castaglia

	* doc/howto/DisplayFiles.html: 
	Updating the DisplayFiles doc with the newly added Display
	variables.

2004-12-15 16:50  castaglia

2004-12-12 14:56  castaglia

2004-12-12 14:00  castaglia

	Bug#2229 - NLST and LIST behave differently e.g. when listing an

	consistent with respect to empty directories, and when listing
	nonexistent directories.

2004-12-12 13:52  castaglia

2004-12-11 16:14  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Bug#2027 - Add log message for timed out passive transfers.

2004-12-08 14:30  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_quotatab.html: 
	Explicitly mention that only one type of limit is in effect at a
	time, and that applicable limits for a given user are not combined.

2004-12-05 00:12  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Yet another place where main_server needs to be set to NULL before
	calling free_pools().  Only affects servers built using the
	--enable-devel=nodaemon option.

2004-12-05 00:03  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	If main_server is not set to NULL before freeing all of the pools
	(from which main_server is allocated), segfaults can occur if
	something tries to log a message.  Note that this only happens if
	the --enable-devel configure option is used, so it doesn't affect
	most users.

2004-12-04 23:58  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Properly set session.c and session.d to NULL once we've closed
	them.

2004-12-04 22:38  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Authentication.html: 
	Correct the RequireValidShell FAQ URL.

2004-12-04 21:50  castaglia

	* include/auth.h, modules/mod_auth.c, src/auth.c: 
	Move that code responsible for looking up the anonymous
	configuration for a given user name, if applicable, out of
	mod_auth.c and into the Auth API.  The main reason for this is to
	allow contrib modules that may need to determine whether a given
	login is to be handled anonymously (e.g.  mod_wrap, mod_sql) the
	ability to use the same code as mod_auth, rather than having to
	duplicate it themselves.  A nice side benefit as that the Auth API
	function added, pr_auth_get_anon_config(), more legibly describes
	what the function does.  This will help to make the mod_auth code
	slightly easier to understand (for some value of "easier").

2004-12-04 20:25  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Limit.html: 
	Add examples of blocking PORT or PASV commands.

2004-12-04 11:17  castaglia

	Add an Upgrade mini-HOWTO to doc/howto/.

2004-12-04 01:20  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_quotatab.html: 
	Fix up the links to the quotatab submodule docs.

	* doc/contrib/mod_quotatab.html: 
	Update the mod_quotatab installation instructions.

2004-12-03 23:52  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_quotatab.c, contrib/mod_quotatab.h,
	doc/contrib/mod_quotatab.html: 
	Add some Display variables for mod_quotatab:
	
	  %{mod_quotatab.limit.bytes_in}
	  %{mod_quotatab.limit.bytes_out}
	  %{mod_quotatab.limit.bytes_xfer}
	  %{mod_quotatab.limit.files_in}

	  %{mod_quotatab.tally.files_out}
	  %{mod_quotatab.tally.files_xfer}
	
	These are documented in the mod_quotatab documentation under
	doc/contrib/.

2004-12-03 23:43  castaglia

	* src/var.c: 
	Pass the exact pointers provided by callers of pr_var_set(), rather
	than copies of the pointed-to data.

2004-12-03 23:40  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Reduce complexity of code needed for displaying byte/file Variables
	by reducing the number of callbacks to two (as opposed to six).

2004-12-03 23:39  castaglia

	* src/display.c: 
	Fix displaying of variables.

2004-12-03 23:02  castaglia

	* RELEASE_NOTES: 
	Mention the new Display variables in the release notes.

2004-12-03 22:59  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/proftpd.h, modules/mod_core.c, modules/mod_xfer.c,
	src/display.c: 
	Bug#2170 - Add byte count variables, similar to the file count
	Display variables.

2004-12-03 17:16  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Handle the case where there's only one name provided in the
	Allow/Deny rule.

2004-12-02 15:15  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_core.c: 
	Bug#2528 - Incorrect username 'and' parsing in AllowUser.

2004-12-01 17:45  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Close the control and data connections before running any
	registered 'core.exit' event handlers.

2004-12-01 17:24  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Unregister the NetIO streams registered by mod_tls during its
	'core.exit' handler.  This prevents segfaults that can happen when
	a session is exiting (as when ABORting an in-progress data
	transfer).

2004-12-01 10:08  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_rewrite.c, modules/mod_core.c, modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Correct a few lingering cases where pr_log_pri() was being called
	with a log level that wasn't in the PR_ namespace.

2004-11-29 14:28  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Style cleanup.

2004-11-28 16:26  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Debugging.html: 
	Updating URL.

2004-11-25 11:03  jwm

	* modules/mod_delay.c: include signal.h to fix the build under
	Solaris 8

2004-11-24 12:38  castaglia

	* src/support.c: 
	More old-style exit handler cruft.

2004-11-22 19:43  castaglia

	* src/display.c: 
	Extraneous #include (and at the bottom of a file).

2004-11-22 19:30  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	We were calling pr_display_file() on DisplayQuit files with the
	arguments in the wrong order.

2004-11-21 22:09  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html: 
	Fix the mod_ctrls_admin documentation.	First, there was a
	duplicate entry for the 'down' control action.	Second, the
	'shutdown' entry had gone completely missing.

2004-11-21 21:36  castaglia

	* NEWS: 
	Bug#2510 - Use of ExportCertData TLSOption leads to segfault.

2004-11-21 21:21  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Since we stuff an SSL * in the strm_data slot for each NetIO
	stream, and there are two streams for a connection, when closing a
	connection, we want to call tls_end_session() (which ends up
	freeing that SSL *) only once per connection.  I chose to do this
	always for the write stream of a connection.  Should help with some
	of the OpenSSL reference counter issues we've been seeing.
	
	This patch is also part of the solution for Bug #2313.

2004-11-21 17:37  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Adding some missing logic; pointers that have been free()'d should
	always be set to NULL afterwards.

2004-11-21 16:34  castaglia

	* Makefile.in: 
	As per Michael's suggestion, remove the .libs/ directory, and
	libtool, during the 'distclean' target.

2004-11-21 16:27  castaglia

	* src/support.c: 
	More old-style exit handler cruft.

2004-11-21 16:26  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Straggler run_exit_handlers() call.  Be gone with ye!

2004-11-21 16:21  castaglia

	* include/support.h, src/main.c, src/support.c: 
	No more support for the old-style exit handlers.

2004-11-21 15:36  castaglia

	* modules/mod_delay.c: 
	Allow SIGTERM to interrupt mod_delay.

2004-11-21 12:26  castaglia

	* modules/mod_delay.c: 
	Since mod_delay uses mmap(), any updates it makes to the DelayTable
	won't be reflected in the mtime field of the file's metadata.  To
	help alleviate this perception, add a 'core.exit' event handler
	that explicitly writes out the DelayTable to disk.
	
	Fix up some memory problems spotted under valgrind.  Also, if the
	expected DelayTable is smaller than the current table, make sure we
	truncate the file.

2004-11-21 11:16  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_ifsession.html: 
	Forgot to list MaxInstances as not being alterable by
	mod_ifsession.

2004-11-21 11:09  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_auth.c: 
	Bug#2520 - Turning on AuthAliasOnly disables MaxClientsPerHost. 
	ProFTPD was not using the TOPLEVEL_CONF macro, as it should have
	been.

2004-11-20 14:35  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/timers.h, src/main.c, src/timers.c: 
	Bug#2516 - Getting "421 Login Timeout" immediately upon connect. 
	The child processes were inheriting the values of static Timer API
	variables, including the parent's timer list.  This causes problems
	when, in the parent process, one of those static variables stops
	being properly updated.  I'm not convinced that the root cause of
	this bug has been found, but this patch addresses the problematic
	behavior, so that at least session processes aren't affected so
	badly.

2004-11-20 13:20  castaglia

	* src/timers.c: 
	Be a little more paranoid: don't set the indispatch flag until
	after alarms have been blocked.

2004-11-20 12:38  castaglia

	* README.IPv6: 
	Remove mention of the Bind directive.  We want it gone.

2004-11-20 12:32  castaglia

	* NEWS, README.IPv6, RELEASE_NOTES, include/bindings.h,
	modules/mod_core.c, src/bindings.c, src/dirtree.c: 
	Bug#2454 - Extend <VirtualHost> to honor multiple addresses.

2004-11-19 19:15  castaglia

	* RELEASE_NOTES: 
	Adding a comment about how use of sendfile() causes download
	transfer speeds not to be displayable.

2004-11-17 09:58  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Controls.html: 
	Mention that only primary groups, not supplemental groups, are
	used.

2004-11-17 09:33  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-11-17 09:28  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	Tweak the configure script to always use our bundled version of
	getaddrinfo() on HP-UX 11.x, since HP-UX's getaddrinfo() (among
	many other things) is busted.

2004-11-14 17:39  castaglia

	* README.modules: 
	Updating README.modules.

2004-11-14 16:21  castaglia

	* modules/: mod_core.c, mod_xfer.c: 
	Deny the SIZE command if we're in ASCII mode, as we do for REST. 
	Be sure to add debug logging for both of these cases.

2004-11-14 15:58  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Check that a scoreboard entry's PID is non-zero before sending the
	zero signal to that PID.

2004-11-14 15:45  castaglia

	* NEWS, doc/howto/ASCII.html, doc/howto/index.html,
	modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Bug#2471 - Restart command (REST) is not working correctly for text
	files.

2004-11-14 13:03  castaglia

	* doc/howto/: Scoreboard.html, index.html: 
	Adding a ScoreboardFile mini-HOWTO.

2004-11-13 15:01  castaglia

	* ltmain.sh: 
	Increase the max allowed command line length in the libtool script
	to be 4K.  I'd rather we encounter the system limit before an
	arbitrarily imposed one.

2004-11-13 14:47  castaglia

	* include/fsio.h, src/fsio.c: 
	Beginnings of support for stackable FSIO layers.  Rather than
	allowing only a one-to-one mapping between paths and FS objects,
	this patch allows for one-to-many mappings, linking FS objects
	together in a linked list for the same path.
	
	At present, only the top layer on the stack, for a given FSIO
	operation, will be used.  I anticipate that it will be the
	responsibility of the called FSIO handler to decide whether it
	wants to act as a filter handler, and pass the parameters farther
	down the stack, or whether it wants to act as a source/sink handler
	and handle the parameters entirely by itself.  This behavior allows
	for backward compatibility with existing FSIO modules.

2004-11-13 14:41  castaglia

	* modules/mod_delay.c: 
	Use proper grammar.

2004-11-11 10:58  castaglia

	* RELEASE_NOTES, modules/mod_log.c: 
	Make "SECURE" an alias for "SEC" when configuring ExtendedLog
	logging classes.

2004-11-10 18:44  castaglia

	* include/table.h, src/main.c, src/table.c: 
	Add a function, pr_table_nalloc(), to the Table API which allows
	for allocating a table with the given number of chains. 
	Previously, callers would need to call pr_table_alloc(), then
	pr_table_ctl() to resize the number of chains, and in doing so
	there would be a slight memory leak.  Now such callers can allocate
	the number of chains (usually smaller than the default of 32) as
	they need.

2004-11-10 10:54  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-11-10 10:34  castaglia

	* RELEASE_NOTES: 
	Mention the new UseSendfile directive.

2004-11-10 10:32  castaglia

	* NEWS, configure.in, modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Bug#2507 - Enable use of sendfile by default.

2004-11-10 10:19  castaglia

	* NEWS, RELEASE_NOTES, contrib/mod_tls.c, include/modules.h,

	Bug#2518 - Ability to log SSL/TLS commands in an ExtendedLog.

2004-11-09 19:26  castaglia

	* src/timers.c: 
	Prevent callers from providing a negative number of seconds when
	adding a timer.

2004-11-09 11:17  castaglia

	* NEWS: 
	Add a header to the NEWS file indicating the Bugzilla URL to use
	for looking up the mentioned bug reports.

2004-11-08 19:07  castaglia

	* modules/mod_delay.c: 
	Use PR_RUN_DIR, not RUN_DIR.

2004-11-08 18:46  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-11-08 18:45  castaglia

	Bug#2480 - Remote users discovery.

2004-11-08 18:41  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	Make mod_delay one of the default modules.

2004-11-08 18:37  castaglia

	* modules/mod_delay.c, doc/modules/mod_delay.html: 
	Adding mod_delay to the distribution.  Part of Bug #2480.

2004-11-07 17:43  castaglia

	* modules/Makefile.in: 
	Found a case where make(1) was not providing $(RM).  How annoying.

2004-11-06 13:25  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-11-06 13:21  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	I prefer, if possible, to see the functions checked in alphabetical
	order.

2004-11-04 21:12  castaglia

	* README.DSO: 
	Adding reminder note.

2004-11-04 16:49  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updated configure.

2004-11-04 16:43  castaglia

	* configure.in, config.h.in: 
	Check for the fdatasync(2) function.

2004-11-04 14:48  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/data.h, modules/mod_xfer.c, src/data.c: 
	Bug#2509 - sendfile() usage fails with > 2GB files.

2004-11-04 14:17  castaglia

	* doc/GetConf: 
	Removing crufty old file.

2004-11-04 11:25  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-11-04 11:11  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in: 
	Add checks for iconv() and nl_langinfo(), which will be needed for
	i18n support.

2004-11-03 12:11  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/index.html: 
	Adding an index to the doc/contrib/ directory.

2004-11-03 11:37  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/: ftpasswd.html, ftpquota.html, mod_ctrls_admin.html,

	Moving the HTML documentation from contrib/ to doc/contrib/.

2004-11-03 11:37  castaglia

	* contrib/: ftpasswd.html, ftpquota.html, mod_ctrls_admin.html,

	Moving the HTML documentation from contrib/ into doc/contrib/.

2004-11-03 08:53  castaglia

	* modules/: mod_auth_pam.c, mod_core.c, mod_ls.c, mod_xfer.c: 
	Removing deprecated directives.

2004-11-03 08:44  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Cleaning up the style of code in mod_sql.  It still needs work, as
	it's inconsistent and thus harder to read and maintain.

2004-11-02 19:18  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in: 
	Check for, and record, the size of a size_t.

2004-11-02 17:54  castaglia

	* include/table.h, src/table.c: 
	When removing keys and entries from the table, rather than
	destroying their pools, add them to free lists, associated with the
	table itself.  Check these free lists when adding new keys and
	entries.  Thus the total memory for a table is proportional to the
	total number of entries ever used at one time, and we don't have as
	much memory churn from the destroying of pools.  The pool members
	of the key and entry structs have thus been removed.
	
	Also handle signals while iterating through the table chains in
	pr_table_empty().

2004-11-02 16:40  castaglia

	* include/default_paths.h: 
	Remove an unused macro, and its accompanying crufty comment.

2004-11-02 10:18  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in, contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c,
	contrib/mod_radius.c, include/conf.h, include/default_paths.h,
	include/mod_ctrls.h, include/netaddr.h, include/scoreboard.h,

	utils/ftpshut.c, utils/ftptop.c, utils/ftpwho.c,
	utils/scoreboard.c, utils/utils.h: 
	Moving many of the macros defining default paths into the 'PR_'
	namespace.  This isn't an issue now, but will become one when
	proftpd installs its header files into the production location,
	which will allow DSO modules to be built outside of the proftpd
	source tree.  When that happens, the likelihood of symbol
	collisions between ProFTPD macros/names and other files increases.

2004-11-01 20:01  castaglia

	* Makefile.in: 
	No need to invoke modules/Makefile's 'shared-modules' target if
	there are no shared module to build.

2004-11-01 19:35  castaglia

	* Makefile.in, lib/Makefile.in, modules/Makefile.in: 
	More tweaks to get builds using just --with-modules to work again.

2004-11-01 19:23  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-11-01 19:15  castaglia

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, lib/Makefile.in, modules/Makefile.in: 
	Need to properly handle the case where the user might specify
	--with-modules, and no --with-shared.  In this case, the
	$(SHARED_MODULE_OBJS) variable will be empty, which was not being
	handled.

2004-11-01 09:48  castaglia

	* NEWS, README.DSO: 
	Mention the addition of DSO support in NEWS, and start on an
	accompanying README.DSO.  There will eventually appear a DSO
	mini-HOWTO as well.

2004-11-01 09:42  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-11-01 09:38  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, Makefile.in, configure.in, modules/Makefile.in: 
	Adding support for a --with-shared configure option, for building
	DSO (aka shared) modules.

2004-11-01 09:30  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c: 
	Calling lt_dlexit() in a 'core.exit' event handler caused proftpd
	to segfault when shutting down.  All of the stashed module *m
	pointers for dynamically loaded modules become invalid after a call
	to lt_dlexit(), and those pointers can be used after mod_dso's exit
	handler.  The solution (though not clean) is to not call
	lt_dlexit().

2004-11-01 09:21  castaglia

	* src/display.c: 
	Bad reuse of variable name.

2004-11-01 09:12  castaglia

	* include/var.h: 
	Forgot to declare the pr_var_delete() function.

2004-10-31 14:39  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c: 
	The dso_unload_module() function is only used if the 'rmmod'
	control action is used, which means that it requires Controls
	support.  Otherwise, we don't need it.

2004-10-31 14:36  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c: 
	Remove an unnecessary function.

2004-10-31 14:27  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Report the line number of the <IfDefine>, <IfModule> sections used
	or skipped.

2004-10-31 14:26  castaglia

	* include/parser.h, src/parser.c: 
	Add a function to the Parser API for getting the current line
	number.  This is useful for better reporting.

2004-10-31 14:11  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c: 
	Some of the loop variables are only used if Controls support is
	enabled.

2004-10-31 14:03  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-10-31 14:00  castaglia

	* aclocal.m4: 
	Update our local autoconf macros, specifically those dealing with
	libtool.  This should fix the warning:
	
	  libtool: link: warning: `AC_LIBTOOL_DLOPEN' not used. Assuming no
	dlopen support.
	
	that I was seeing.

2004-10-31 13:22  castaglia

	* src/table.c: 
	Quell a compiler warning about "use of cast expressions as lvalues"
	by being explicit.

2004-10-31 13:06  castaglia

	* config.h.in, include/conf.h: 
	The configure script was checking for <inttypes.h>, but we were not
	recording whether it was present or not, or including the header if
	it was present.  Shame on us.

2004-10-31 12:58  castaglia

	* modules/Makefile.in: 
	The building of modules should require the libltdl header or
	library.  Just libtool to handle the linking.

2004-10-31 12:56  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Add the display of PR_TUNABLE_RCVBUFSZ, PR_TUNABLE_SNDBUFSZ to the
	-V output.

2004-10-31 12:49  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-10-31 12:46  castaglia

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: 
	Attempting to get a DSO-enabled proftpd to link properly on
	platforms other than Linux by linking with libltdl as an object
	file, rather than linking against it as a library.

2004-10-31 12:24  castaglia

	* modules/mod_log.c: 
	Since we're using %ld as a format, explicitly cast the value as a
	long int, rather than as a time_t.

2004-10-31 12:19  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-10-31 12:16  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, configure.in: 
	Let's move the definition of HAVE_CONFIG_H into Make.rules.  The
	ordering of HAVE_CONFIG_H in the flags is therefore nicer.

2004-10-31 12:13  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-10-31 12:11  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	Define HAVE_CONFIG_H when compiling proftpd.  Some of the files
	under lib/ require this, in order to pull in <config.h>, and
	subsequently some of the system headers needed.

2004-10-31 12:06  castaglia

	* lib/Makefile.in: 
	If LIB_DEPS happens to be the empty string (as needed for Solaris),

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-10-31 11:09  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in, include/options.h, src/data.c,
	src/dirtree.c: 
	First, fix a bug where session.xfer.buf was allocated as
	PR_TUNABLE_BUFFER_SIZE, rather than PR_TUNABLE_XFER_BUFFER_SIZE.
	
	Next, try to be smarter about the default value for
	PR_TUNABLE_XFER_BUFFER_SIZE.  The configure script now runs a small
	test program that uses getsockopt(2) to determine the sizes of a
	TCP socket's send and receive buffers.	The smaller of the two
	buffer sizes is used as the default value for
	PR_TUNABLE_XFER_BUFFER_SIZE; the --enable-transfer-buffer-size
	option will override this test.  The test program also records
	those send/receive buffer sizes in PR_TUNABLE_RCVBUFSZ and
	PR_TUNABLE_SNDBUFSZ, which were previously hardcoded to be 8K.

2004-10-31 11:03  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c, src/data.c: 
	Style nits: struct stat variables should be named 'st', and the
	'xlate' name for the ASCII handling routines is not appropriate in
	light of the i18n translation we will be needing.  It's more of a
	transformation, really.

	modules/mod_core.c, src/display.c, src/main.c, src/var.c: 
	Bug#2701 - Add Variables API.
	
	This also separates the code used for handling Display* files into
	its own file; src/main.c was calling into modules/mod_core.c for
	that function, which is bad design.  Core code should not be using
	functions implemented in modules.

2004-10-31 10:45  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in, src/main.c:

	include/dirtree.h, include/parser.h, modules/mod_core.c,

	Separating the parser code out from src/dirtree.c into its own
	file, src/parser.c, with a proper header file documenting the API
	(include/parser.h).  Update the rest of the core code to use the
	new API as needed.

2004-10-30 17:57  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ifsession.c: 
	There is not enough information to call resolve_deferred_dirs() at
	session init time.  This function is usually for expanding the
	tilde in path names, and at session init time, we don't know the
	user name for expansion.

2004-10-30 16:18  castaglia

2004-10-30 16:14  castaglia

	Use the Auth API functions in the 'pr_' namespace rather than

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-10-30 15:06  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	Tweaking the configure script a bit, providing more complete path
	information in flags, etc.  Not really needed for the default build
	process which we all know and love, but will become necessary when
	building DSO modules.

2004-10-30 14:55  castaglia

	* src/timers.c: 
	This struct is no longer typedef'd.

2004-10-30 14:01  castaglia

	* include/timers.h: 
	Include some redefines for supporting legacy modules that may not

	* contrib/mod_sql_mysql.c, contrib/mod_sql_postgres.c,
	contrib/mod_tls.c, modules/mod_ctrls.c: 
	Update the contrib/ modules to use the Timer API in the 'pr_'

2004-10-30 13:45  castaglia

	* include/timers.h, modules/mod_auth.c, modules/mod_core.c,

	* doc/modules/mod_dso.html: 
	Adding documentation for mod_dso.

2004-10-29 14:46  castaglia

	* src/event.c: 
	As a comment to myself indicated, it is necessary to pstrdup() the
	name of the event for which a listener is being registered, rather
	than stashing a pointer to the given name directly.  This was
	causing a segfault when the pointer to the name given was part of a
	dynamically loaded module.

2004-10-29 12:17  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	The DebugLevel configuration handler was not recognizing 10 as a

	Disable the actions that try to use autoheader and automake.  These
	aren't installed on every system, and we don't really use them.

2004-10-28 22:51  castaglia

	* configure.in, lib/Makefile.in: 
	Only configure, build, and clean the libltdl/ directory if
	--enable-dso is selected.  Otherwise, let the build proceed as
	usual, and let the normal 'clean' target work without throwing an
	error.

2004-10-28 22:33  castaglia

	* ltmain.sh, modules/mod_dso.c: 
	Adding a (slightly modified) copy of ltmain.sh, which is
	responsible for creating the libtool executable.  Also adding
	mod_dso.c.  All part of the preparations for adding DSO support to
	ProFTPD.

2004-10-28 22:19  castaglia

	Adding GNU libtool M4 definitions to our aclocal.m4.

2004-10-28 18:10  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	The checks for <IfDefine>, </IfDefine>, <IfModule>, and

2004-10-26 15:14  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, include/conf.h, include/table.h, src/table.c: 
	Adding the Table API source.

2004-10-19 18:32  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	It is possible for SSL_read() to return SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE as
	well, so handle that case the same way as handling
	SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ: select() on the socket until it is available
	for writing, then call SSL_read() again.
	
	Note that this happens (ideally) only when a renegotiation is
	occuring on the underlying SSL session.  So set the
	SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY mode too (if the OpenSSL version supports it),
	which will hopefully keep renegotiations from causing SSL_read() to
	return SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE.

2004-10-18 09:42  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	A few cases where log_pri() was being used, rather than

	Bug#2499 - make_cmd() does not NULL-terminate cmd->argv[].

2004-10-14 19:43  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c: 
	Move the handling of the AccessGrantMsg and DisplayLogin directives
	into the POST_CMD handler for PASS, rather than in the CMD handler.
	 This is aesthetically where such handling should occur, and it
	makes it possible for future enhancements where contrib modules can
	add their own variables to be interpolated into the DisplayLogin
	file.

2004-10-11 20:07  castaglia

	* src/inet.c: 
	Nicer error message.

	* src/bindings.c: 
	Avoid an infinite loop problem with Bind is used by stashing
	pointers to the bindings to use, when accepting a client
	connection, in an array_header, rather than overloading the 'next'
	field in the conn_t struct.

2004-10-11 09:33  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Fix case where the config tree was not dumped if the server_rec had
	an empty set of config_recs.  The name of the server_rec should
	still be dumped in such cases.

2004-10-09 15:34  castaglia

	* doc/howto/TLS.html: 
	Update link to FTPS Draft.

2004-10-09 15:24  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	The parser internals are crufty, and are in need of rewriting and

	(to me, at least).

2004-10-09 13:46  castaglia

	Use the Auth API in the 'pr_' namespace.

2004-10-06 11:42  castaglia

	deprecated in the 1.2.10 release cycle.

2004-10-02 13:22  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Handle signals when in potentially infinite gotos, so that the
	process can be interrupted.
	
	Expand the TLSLog entry for refused PROT commands a little more, to
	explain why the PROT command was refused (e.g. 'PROT C' was sent,

	compile-time settings, a la Apache.

2004-09-04 19:37  castaglia

	* config.h.in, include/conf.h: 
	Move the HPUX socklen_t bug fix to include/conf.h, a header file
	that is not preprocessed by autoconf.  The autoconf preprocessing
	was causing the #undef in the generated config.h header file to be
	commented out, which would result in complaints from stringent
	compilers.

2004-09-04 19:23  castaglia

	* contrib/: mod_sql.c, mod_sql_mysql.c, mod_sql_postgres.c: 
	Remove the _MOD_VERSION #define from mod_sql, as it was not doing
	as was intended, I think.  Much better, cleaner, and more explicit
	to have each module #define its own VERSION string, and to use that
	version string consistently within the module.

2004-08-25 11:08  castaglia

	* src/data.c: 
	When using sendfile(), only reset the transmission timers if bytes
	have actually been written out.  sendfile() can return zero,
	indicating that it wrote zero bytes -- we do not want to reset the
	timers in this case, for it could indicate other issues with the
	file descriptor from which data are being read.
	
	This fixes an endless loop seen at a particular site involving use
	of sendfile() and NFS/SAN-shared files.

2004-08-24 15:24  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Reset the 'have_prot' flag to false when a successful PROT C
	command is processed.

2004-08-12 16:24  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Update to patch to mod_xfer for Bug #2444: the PROT command is
	allowed before authentication.	The patch was required
	authentication first, causing issutes for FTPS clients that sent
	PROT before USER.

	* NEWS, src/log.c, src/main.c: 
	Bug#2427 - proftpd gets a memory fault when run from ssh batch
	mode.

2004-08-07 15:21  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Two more cases where the IP address contacted by the client should
	be used, if present, rather than the ServerAddress field of the
	relevant server_rec.

2004-08-07 13:58  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Fix a minor bug in the reporting of ServerIdent, where the wrong IP
	address may be displayed.  For example, with the following
	configuration:
	
	  <VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>
	    Bind 1.2.3.4
	    ...
	  </VirtualHost>
	
	a client connecting to 1.2.3.4 should see "[127.0.0.1]" at the tail
	end of the default ServerIdent displayed, rather than the more
	appropriate "[1.2.3.4]".  The fix is to use the IP address to which
	the client connected, rather than the ServerAddress field of the
	server_rec to which the client connected.  As the case with Bind
	shows, multiple IP addresses may be associated with the same
	server_rec, and the IP address displayed to the connecting client
	should not "leak" this fact.

2004-08-05 19:16  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Reorder the timing of calling pr_ident_lookup(), making it occur
	after modules have been initialized.  This makes it possible for
	mod_ifsession, for example, to alter if ident lookups will be
	enabled, e.g.:
	
	  <IfClass foo>
	    IdentLookups off
	  </IfClass>
	
	so that ident lookups can be enabled/disabled selectively.

	* NEWS, modules/mod_auth_file.c: 
	Bug#2445 - AuthUserFile in <Global> context overrides <VirtualHost>

	cycle, and fixed The Right Way(tm).

2004-07-30 18:35  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Store the original name configured by a MasqueradeAddress directive
	in the config_rec, along with the resolved netaddr object.  This
	will make it possible to re-resolve the original name at a later
	date.

2004-07-30 17:07  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Limit.html: 
	Add example <Limit LOGIN> configuration that allows only anonymous

2004-07-30 10:42  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c:

2004-07-21 16:58  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_auth_file.c, modules/mod_auth_unix.c: 
	Bug #2411 - AIX5 portability bug with mod_auth_unix, mod_auth_file.
	 Using gcc on AIX5, these files compile without complaint. 
	However, using the IBM compiler and following the instructions in
	README.AIX, they will fail on AIX5.  The fix is to extend for AIX5
	the portability hack that is done for AIX4.

2004-07-20 10:39  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/modules.h, modules/mod_core.c, src/auth.c: 
	Bug #2440 - Unable to use PAM authentication properly.	As
	explained in the bug report, the deprecation of all *Authoritative
	directives causes an issue with modules like mod_auth_pam.  This
	patch makes use of an unused flag variable in the authtable
	structure in order to implement the setting of auth module
	authoritativeness via the AuthOrder directive.

2004-07-14 17:08  castaglia

	Only perform <Limit LOGIN> checks if we've actually merged

	TOPLEVEL_CONF macro (which correctly handles <Anonymous> contexts)
	to avoid inadvertently checking the wrong <Limit LOGIN> block.

	Updating the FTPS Draft to the current version.

2004-06-30 19:00  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Fix pr_expr_eval_class_and() and pr_expr_eval_class_or() to
	properly handle the case where session.class may be NULL (as when
	there is no <Class> definition that matches the connecting client).
	 Previously, if there was no matching <Class> for a client, a rule
	such as:
	
	  <IfClass !name>
	
	would evaluate to false.  It _should_ evaluate to true; this change
	makes it so.
	
	This fixes a problem Michael was encountering with mod_ifsession
	and Classes.

2004-06-30 18:52  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	When handling <Global> contexts in fixup_globals(), only handle
	contexts that have both the right config_type (CONF_GLOBAL) _and_
	the right name ("<Global>").  Contrib modules (e.g. mod_ifsession)
	might create their own contexts that use the CONF_GLOBAL flag; in
	the case of mod_ifsession, the fact that fixup_globals() was
	handling the mod_ifsession-created context config_recs was causing
	a bug when <If*> sections were used within <Global> contexts.
	
	This change also includes some style cleanup.

2004-06-30 18:17  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c:

	* NEWS, contrib/mod_quotatab_sql.c, contrib/mod_sql.c,
	include/support.h, src/support.c: 
	Bug#2420 - Name field is not escaped before querying database.
	
	This patch fixes mod_quotatab_sql to escape the name string used. 
	To do this, several changes were made: the _sql_strip_spaces()
	function of mod_sql.c was made a public ProFTPD API string function
	(pr_str_strip), so that that code need not be duplicated in both
	mod_sql.c and mod_quotatab_sql.c, a new HOOK to mod_sql's
	sql_escapestring function was added, under the symbol
	'sql_escapestr', to avoid further code duplication, and
	mod_quotatab_sql was updated to make use of the new API.

2004-05-31 14:49  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c: 
	Removing the 'dump' control action from mod_ctrls_admin.  A new

2004-05-31 10:47  castaglia

	* src/modules.c: 
	Missed a case where the PR_SYM_CONF hashing needed to be handled
	differently.

2004-05-30 18:51  castaglia

	* src/modules.c: 
	The changes made earlier, to have processing of configuration
	directives use the stash directly, caused a problem.  The prior
	structure allowed for case-insensitive comparisons between the
	directive name in the config file and the name defined by the
	processing module.  By switching to doing lookups from the stash
	directly, such case-insensitive comparisons became difficult.
	
	So, for now, whenever a PR_SYM_CONF symbol is added or requested
	from the stash, its hash value is calculated not from the symbol
	name directly, but from a lowercased version of the name (and only
	for PR_SYM_CONF symbols).  In order to make this work, there is now
	special-case handling of PR_SYM_CONF, and the stash_lookup()
	functions use strcasecmp() rather than strcmp().  I hope this
	doesn't cause any problems with other symbols.
	
	In the future, when the proposed Tables API is complete, I'd like
	to have completely separate tables for the different symbol types. 
	This will (hopefully) make lookups faster (smaller namespace to
	search) and allow customized hashing/comparison functions
	(PR_SYM_CONF symbols needing different treatment from other symbols
	in this case) on a per-table basis.

2004-05-30 15:46  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c, include/modules.h, modules/mod_core.c,
	src/modules.c: 
	Add pr_module_load() and pr_module_unload() functions, for loading
	and unloading modules (and their symbols) from the stash.  Rework
	the rest of the code to work with the changes (i.e. removed crufty
	globals).

2004-05-30 14:54  castaglia

	* NEWS: 
	Bug#2125 - -vv command line switch should list versions of modules.

2004-05-30 14:50  castaglia

	* modules/mod_cap.c, src/main.c: 
	Minor formatting tweak.  Update mod_cap to report its version. 
	Other modules will follow.

2004-05-30 14:48  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Typo.

2004-05-30 14:45  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Bug#2125 - -vv command line switch should list versions of modules.
	
	With this change, modules _can_ report their version (or other
	short descriptor)in such a way that it will be listed if the -vv
	command line option is used.  It is not required for modules to do
	so; if they do not, just the module name is displayed.

2004-05-30 14:34  castaglia

	* include/modules.h: 
	Extend the module structure to include fields for module version,
	and an opage handle for the module (for libltdl pointers).  This
	extension do not break the currently-defined module structures in
	module files.

2004-05-29 19:39  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c, src/dirtree.c, src/modules.c,
	src/sets.c: 
	More prep work for loadable modules.  This change removes use of
	the m_conftable global variable, shifting the users of that
	variable to using the stash directly, via pr_stash_get_symbol(). 
	For example, mod_ctrls_admin was using m_conftable for supporting
	the 'get directives' control action.  Now that handler iterates
	through the stash directly for PR_SYM_CONF symbols (which required
	some adjusting of the stash internals to allow for such
	interating).

2004-05-29 16:38  castaglia

	* src/event.c: 
	Make pr_event_unregister() function as documented if given a NULL
	callback argument.

2004-05-29 16:02  castaglia

	* include/modules.h, modules/glue.sh, modules/mod_core.c,
	src/modules.c: 
	More fun with the loaded_modules list.	Initially, the
	loaded_modules linked list will be NULL; it is the job of
	modules_init() to initialize the modules in the static_modules
	list, and add a pointer to the loaded module to the loaded_modules
	list.
	
	More work needs to be done on abstracting the process of loading of
	a module.

2004-05-29 15:31  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ctrls.c: 
	Clean up the ControlsLog entries when encountering a stale
	connection: we don't need to know the full timestamps, just the
	difference as compared to the ControlsAuthFreshness.

2004-05-29 14:02  castaglia

	* include/modules.h, src/main.c, src/modules.c: 
	Use "modules", plural, to indicate that the function acts on
	multiple modules, not just one.

2004-05-29 13:13  castaglia

	* src/modules.c: 
	Add sane errno values.

2004-05-29 13:03  castaglia

	* include/modules.h, modules/glue.sh, modules/mod_core.c,
	modules/mod_ctrls.c, src/main.c, src/modules.c: 
	Beginning work on supporting loadable modules.	The modules/glue.sh
	file autogenerates a file that defines the static_modules array,
	which contains the module structure pointers from all the
	statically compiled modules.  This list cannot be modified.  For
	loadable modules, we need a modifiable list, which I've added to
	the script: loaded_modules.  Initially, loaded_modules is identical
	to static_modules.  A pr_module_get() function has been added, to
	lookup a module pointer given its name.

2004-05-29 12:52  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ctrls.c: 
	Add more info to the ControlsLog when the ControlsAuthFreshness is
	exceeded, to help in debugging why this happens.

	* doc/howto/Directory.html: 
	Wording update.

2004-05-28 21:19  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Fix handling of memory passed to mlock(2).  It seems that mlock(2)
	is very picky, and wants a page-aligned address only. 
	malloc(3)/calloc(3) do not return page-aligned addresses by default
	(although FreeBSD's man page suggests that for a sufficient size
	request, they will), so we help them along by adding some
	page-alignment code.  We still want to stash the pointer returned
	by malloc(), not the aligned address, so that we can properly free
	the allocated memory later.
	
	Also use pr_log_debug(), rather than logging to the TLSLog, when
	locking passphrases into memory, for at that point in the server
	lifecycle, the TLSLog has not yet been opened.

2004-05-28 18:56  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Silence a compiler warning by providing a default value.

2004-05-27 10:20  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Registering for the wrong event: we want 'core.postparse', not
	'core.restart'.  Close the TLSLog during a restart, so that it can
	be rolled.  The TLSLog will be reopened by the next session.

2004-05-26 12:25  castaglia

2004-05-25 16:00  castaglia

2004-05-25 10:17  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Make sure that fixup_servers() happens before generating the
	'core.postparse' event (mod_tls' 'core.postparse' handler was
	tickling a segfault because one of the server_recs had a NULL
	ServerName field; fixup_servers() sets all of the server_rec fields
	appropriately).

2004-05-24 16:27  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ctrls.c: 
	Fix a problem when restarting a proftpd with mod_ctrls.  Some
	variables were allocated from the module pool, and then being used
	after that pool had been destroyed/reallocated.  This meant that
	different configurations and interactions might (or might not)
	work.

2004-05-24 14:35  castaglia

	Update the release notes with mention of TimeoutLinger.

2004-05-21 10:19  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/data.h, modules/mod_core.c, src/data.c: 
	Add a TimeoutLinger option.  It's just simpler to change this value
	via the config file, for those sites that encounter troubles with
	lingering closes, rather than requiring a reconfigure and
	recompile.

2004-05-20 10:28  castaglia

	Check for signals while waiting for all kids to end when handling a

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html: 
	Typo.

2004-05-18 15:43  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html: 
	Document that 'ftpdctl get' accepts both 'config' and 'directives'
	parameters.

2004-05-17 11:24  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c, modules/mod_xfer.c, src/data.c, src/main.c: 
	Generate events when the Timeout* callbacks cause the session to
	time out.

2004-05-15 10:25  castaglia

	* src/data.c: 
	Fix an edge case when handling ASCII translation: if this buffer
	ends in a CR, and the next buffer starts with an LF, we need not
	add a CR in front of the LF.  Prior to this change, though, proftpd
	would forget about that dangling CR in the previous buffer, treat
	the LF as a bare LF, and add a CR, resulting in a CR-CR-LF sequence
	in the output stream rather than the proper CR-LF.

2004-05-13 07:01  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c, include/modules.h, src/main.c, src/modules.c: 
	Remove the explicit postparse callback registration code in favor
	of the new Events API.

2004-05-12 19:58  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Use more future-proof APIs to access the X509v3 subjectAltNames in
	the client cert.  Properly NUL-terminate strings obtained from
	memory BIOs.

2004-05-12 18:13  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_auth.c, src/mkhome.c: 
	Bug#2410 - CreateHome always copies skel directory.

2004-05-11 19:20  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	I don't think this is valid anymore, if it ever was.  The
	IPV6_ADDRFORM socket option is not supported on FreeBSD or Solaris,
	and looks to be deprecated (if not removed entirely) in later Linux
	kernels.

2004-05-11 16:37  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_auth_file.c, modules/mod_auth_unix.c: 
	Bug#2407 - mod_auth_file does not allow for proper cascading of
	"end" and "set" auth requests

2004-05-11 09:56  castaglia

	* include/modules.h, src/main.c, src/modules.c: 
	Removing the daemon startup registration handlers; these have been
	superceded by Events (e.g. the "core.startup" event).

2004-05-10 10:50  castaglia

	* NEWS, src/main.c: 
	Bug#2332 - SO_OOBINLINE error after upgrading proftpd from 1.2.6 to
	1.2.9.	Attempt to fix by moving the setting of these socket
	options to happen earlier in the session.

2004-05-09 13:05  castaglia

	* src/data.c: 
	When opening a data connection, check for the ESPV ALL mode as
	well.

2004-05-08 18:07  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	When looking up the FS to use for a path, always start with the
	root FS ("/") as the best FS to handle the path.  This fixes a bug
	where the FS handlers registered by modules like mod_md5fs or
	mod_gzipfs were being used for paths other than those for which
	they were registered.
	
	Also fix a bug where an FS that did not start with a '/', such as
	one used by mod_conf_sql, would cause the FSIO API to prepend the
	current location when it shouldn't have; the FSIO API simply needed
	to use the proper check for whether the given path was an absolute
	path or not.

2004-05-07 20:21  castaglia

	* contrib/: mod_sql_mysql.c, mod_sql_postgres.c: 
	Style cleanup of the SQL backend modules.  Also updating them to
	use an event handler for the "core.exit" event.
	
	Fixed their session initialization routines to always allocate a
	new conn_pool and a new conn_cache.  Eventually the mod_sql API
	will be revamped to handle these structures a little better.

	* NEWS, modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Bug#2405 - "LIST *" should not list dotfiles.

2004-05-05 10:49  castaglia

	* src/child.c: 
	Fix the logic determining when to create a new child list.  Also,
	when creating that list, use a subpool of the child_pool, rather
	than passing child_pool itself; the list allocator assigns the
	given pool into the list's 'pool' member, rather than creating a
	subpool from the given pool and allocating the list from what
	(which is how I would expect it to be done).

2004-05-04 09:54  castaglia

	* lib/glibc-glob.c: 
	The buffer length should be PR_TUNABLE_LOGIN_MAX + 1.

2004-05-03 19:59  castaglia

	* lib/glibc-glob.c: 
	Patch the bundled glob implementation to use PR_TUNABLE_LOGIN_MAX
	when the _SC_LOGIN_MAX sysconf variable is not available.  This
	brings the implementation more in line with the rest of proftpd.

2004-05-03 10:25  castaglia

2004-04-29 12:28  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, include/child.h, include/conf.h, src/child.c,
	src/main.c: 
	Move the handling of child objects into their own file.  This will
	help by letting modules be able to know how many existing sessions
	there are.  However, the child list routines will not be in the
	public "pr_" namespace, as they are not currently suitable for

	* contrib/mod_ldap.c, include/sets.h, modules/mod_auth_unix.c,
	src/dirtree.c, src/main.c, src/sets.c, src/support.c:

	consistent with the pool members of other proftpd structures.

2004-04-28 20:35  castaglia

	* README.IPv6: 
	Note the sysctl names that affect handling of wildcard sockets and

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Protect against a possible segfault that occurs when mod_sql
	assumes that a query has data, by checking for a valid data pointed
	in the returned modret_t object.

2004-04-21 18:32  castaglia

	* src/inet.c: 
	Only set the TOS (Type Of Service) flags on IPv4 sockets; IPv6
	sockets don't support TOS flags, as far as I know.  This should fix
	the
	
	  error setting write fd IP_TOS: Option not supported by protocol
	
	errors seen on some platforms (e.g. Solaris).

	Fix the logging of IP addresses in the utmp/wtmp log on Linux. 
	Formatting cleanup.

2004-04-19 16:59  castaglia

	* include/class.h, modules/mod_core.c, src/class.c: 
	Add a Satisfy directive.  Note that this directive does NOT
	function like Apache's Satisfy directive.  This current
	implementation is to be used when defining a class, to specify how
	to evaluate all of the rules of the class: any, or all.
	
	Future work will overload this directive to work as users would
	like (see Bug#1898) for the <Limit> context.

2004-04-19 16:33  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Report line numbers when parsing .ftpaccess files, too.

2004-04-18 10:00  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Have the fatal messages reported during configuration parsing
	report the line number and configuration file, for easier fixing of
	broken configs.

2004-04-16 09:33  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/privs.h: 
	Bug#2317 - Wrong order of privs calls on HP generates "unable to
	setregid()".  error.  The problem turned out to be a call to
	setregid() before a call to setreuid(), but only in the HP privs
	code (non-seteuid() case).  The fix was trivial: call setreuid()
	first, to make sure the proper UIDs are set, then call setregid().

	* contrib/mod_rewrite.html: 
	The features listed under "future work" have been implemented.

2004-04-15 15:14  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Much improved handling of OpenSSL's error queue, so that the TLSLog
	can properly show all of the errors in the queue (rather than just
	the top error, which is usually not too helpful in pinpointing the
	actual problem).

2004-04-15 14:31  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_rewrite.html: 
	Document the flags parameters for RewriteCondition, RewriteRule. 
	Also document the possible pattern variants allowed for
	RewriteCondition.  Add an example of using mod_rewrite to make all
	uploaded files have uppercased filenames.

2004-04-15 11:46  castaglia

	* sample-configurations/basic.conf: 
	The default configuration file should not allow use of SITE CHMOD.

2004-04-14 11:11  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c, modules/mod_ctrls.c, src/ctrls.c: 
	Remove the unused 'set' control action from mod_ctrls_admin.  Make
	the 'lsctrl' control action list only enabled control actions. 
	Initialize the ControlsSocketACL such that access to the socket is
	allowed to everyone by default; access to individual control
	actions still defaults to "deny" unless access is explicitly
	granted via configuration.

2004-04-13 13:19  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Filters.html: 
	Emphasize _not_ using both an Allow and a Deny Filter at the same

2004-04-13 10:55  castaglia

	* include/privs.h: 
	Revert part of my previous update to privs.h; it included a

2004-04-13 10:52  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/privs.h:

	primary GID.

2004-04-13 09:48  castaglia

	* include/dirtree.h, src/dirtree.c: 
	Add a SID (Server ID) to every server_rec.  This SID is a unique ID
	that is automatically assigned to each generated server_rec when
	proftpd parses its configuration.  SIDs are useful for tracking
	purposes, particularly for contrib modules that want to track which
	vhost caused something to happen.
	
	Format/style cleanups, removed unused CLASS_USER #define.

2004-04-13 09:46  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c: 
	Update the proftpd version required by mod_ctrls_admin.

2004-04-12 10:41  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c: 
	Have AnonRejectPasswords generate an event.

2004-04-12 10:35  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ctrls.c: 
	Consistent use of strcmp().  Use ANY_MODULE where appropriate,
	rather than NULL.

2004-04-12 10:14  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	Fix pr_fsio_getline() to handle the case where a config line,
	broken across several lines in the config file using line
	continuations, has one of the lines commented out, e.g.:
	
	   SomeDirective \
	     foo \
	   #  bar \
	     baz
	
	Without this patch, pr_fsio_getline() would return the '#'
	character, which is not what most people would think would happen.

2004-04-12 10:09  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Be a little more strict when checking for "${env:...}" strings in
	the config file.
	
	Format/style cleanup.

2004-04-11 15:50  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Typo.

2004-04-11 15:03  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Make the 'core.signal.USR2' event handler check for new
	TransferRates when involved in any of the file data transfer
	commands (APPE, RETR, STOR, STOU), not just RETR.  Update comments
	as well.

2004-04-11 13:42  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_ctrls.c, src/ctrls.c: 
	Bug#2383 - mod_ctrls.c: ctrls_listen(): Invalid size in bind()
	argument.

2004-04-11 13:35  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Add a handler for the event 'core.signal.USR2' to mod_xfer.  The
	handler causes mod_xfer, if and only if the RETR command is
	currently being handled, to rescan the config tree for TransferRate
	entries.
	
	The 'core.signal.USR2' event is only generated when Controls have
	been enabled, so in most cases this won't change anything.  Its
	purpose is mainly to help the mod_shaper module be able to change
	the TransferRate for a session in mid-transfer.

2004-04-11 13:27  castaglia

	* include/dirtree.h, src/dirtree.c: 
	Add a new merge flag, CF_SILENT.  Unlike the rest of the CF_ flags,
	this flag is handled by fixup_dirs(); the other CF_ flags are
	handled by the internal _reorder_dirs() function.  When
	fixup_dirs() sees CF_SILENT, it will not print a debug
	configuration dump, which is its default behavior.

2004-04-11 13:22  castaglia

	* src/event.c: 
	Make sure that the order of event registration matches module load
	order.	This helps when the same event may be handled by multiple
	modules, and the order of handling is important.

2004-04-11 13:12  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	This copy of copy_file() is no longer needed.

2004-04-10 13:55  castaglia

2004-04-10 11:33  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Directory.html:

	* doc/howto/ServerType.html: 
	Adding ServerType doc.

2004-04-09 19:30  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth_unix.c: 
	When compiling on a HP-UX box which supports bigcrypt(), the
	following warning is seen:
	
	  passing arg 1 of `bigcrypt' discards qualifiers from pointer
	target type
	
	Quell this warning by explicitly casting the arguments to
	bigcrypt() to be char *.

2004-04-09 19:01  castaglia

2004-04-09 09:58  castaglia

	* include/fsio.h, modules/mod_core.c, src/fsio.c, src/mkhome.c: 
	The CreateHome code also included a static copy_file() function. 
	This change refactors the code so that both CreateHome and the
	rename-across-mount-points code both use the same function, added
	to the FSIO code as pr_fs_copy_file().	Code reuse good.

2004-04-09 09:54  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ifsession.c: 
	Removing this HOOK, as it won't work as intended.  May re-add in

2004-04-08 17:23  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_core.c: 
	Bug#2385 - Renames fail with error "Invalid cross-device link".  In

	existing at the destination location is lost.

2004-04-08 15:50  castaglia

	Add comment about per-session settings in mod_quotatab docs.

2004-04-07 12:02  castaglia

	QuotaTallyTable will not be updated.

2004-04-06 16:17  castaglia

	* NEWS, config.h.in: 
	Bug#2221 - proftpd on hp-ux 11.22.  Override the default socklen_t

2004-04-05 18:50  castaglia

	* src/ctrls.c: 
	Fix a format warning on Solaris.

2004-04-05 11:01  castaglia

	* src/ctrls.c: 
	Remove a hardcoded maximum limit on the size of request strings
	that can be sent using the Controls API.  Uncovered when trying to
	send messages larger than 8 Kb via SysV message queues.

2004-04-05 10:59  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c, src/scoreboard.c: 
	Check for an error return value from pr_rewind_scoreboard().
	
	Keep track of the process which opened the cached scoreboard fd. 
	It's possible to have the daemon process open the fd, and then
	fork, which means the child will have that same fd.  However, the
	child may fdopen() another file onto that fd (e.g. if the fd is 0),
	thus losing the scoreboard fd.	This patch also prevents the
	possibility of a file descriptor leak by having the same process
	open the scoreboard multiple times (e.g. when multiple modules call
	pr_open_scoreboard()).

2004-04-05 10:54  castaglia

	* NEWS: 
	Mention the adding of mini-HOWTOs in NEWS.

2004-03-23 15:29  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Be more explicit about the expected return value from

	not handling printing of NULL pointers gracefully, unlike glibc.

2004-03-19 12:22  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_core.c: 
	Bug#2369 - EPSV should not send network address when
	MasqueradeAddress is used.  RFC 2428 is not very clear on this
	point, for it introduces a discrepancy in the possible responses to
	PASV versus EPSV.  Until this can be cleared up, do not honor
	MasqueradeAddress when EPSV is used by the client.

	Add some debug logging, level 10, showing when a name is being

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Make sure that errno has an appropriate value in the case where a

	  CreateHome on skel /etc/ftpd/skel dirmode 700
	
	However, the current CreateHome implementation assumes that the
	parameter after the Boolean will always be the mode.  This change
	makes the config handler check for any preceding 'skel' or
	'dirmode' keywords before trying to process that parameter as the
	mode.  Hopefully now the examples will work properly.

	* contrib/mod_quotatab.c:

	data, and quotatab_read() would degrade that write-lock to a
	read-lock, then release it completely, leaving the actual write
	operation unprotected by a lock.  This patch fixes the contention
	in the locking routinese by having them check and set a static
	variable.

	multiple handlers for this same event.	This way, mod_ctrls_common
	can use SIGUSR2 to get other proftpd processes to print memory
	dumps, and thus keeping the ability to get memory dumps from any
	proftpd process.  Without this change, if controls are enabled, we
	can only get a memory dump of the daemon process (and most of the

	* modules/mod_auth_file.c: 
	The new group membership debugging found a bug: mod_auth_file, when

	for the group was different from the user's primary GID.  For GID
	stuff, this is fine; however, for group expressions in proftpd.conf
	that may rely on those group names, it's a bug.
	
	This allows for an interesting situation: assign a user to multiple
	groups with different names, but the same GID.	Thus you can
	workaround the NGROUPS_MAX system limit using a long list of group
	names; the operating system won't notice, and proftpd will happily
	check the names.  Nice.

	Bug#2242 - Parsing during rehashing was failing with an EPERM.	The
	problem was that configuration directive handlers (specifically,
	SyslogFacility and SystemLog) were using PRIVS_RELINQUISH, which

	use the PRIVS macros.

2003-10-13 00:15  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2003-10-13 00:12  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in: 
	Not all systems have the hsterror() function, for converting
	resolver error codes (h_errno) to strings.  Thus, we need to check
	for it, and provide a bundled replacement if it is not present. 
	I'll be adding the glibc implementation of hstrerror() soon.

2003-10-12 22:02  castaglia

	* src/netaddr.c: 
	This get_v4inaddr() function is only called from one place (at
	present), and all the necessary sanity checks have already been
	performed, so there is no need to do them again.

2003-10-11 12:32  castaglia

	* src/netaddr.c: 
	Typo.

2003-10-11 12:29  castaglia

	* src/netaddr.c: 
	The retrieval of the IPv4 portion of an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address is
	only necessary when gethostbyname2() is being used, rather than
	gethostbyname() (I think...this may need to change in the future).

2003-10-11 12:27  castaglia

	* src/netaddr.c: 
	When performing reverse DNS lookups on IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses,
	we need to be a little more careful about which checks are
	performed.  This change alters the call to gethostbyname2() (when
	it is present) to be AF_INET if the netaddr is an IPv4-mapped IPv6
	address, rather than using AF_INET6 as was done previously.  The
	subsequent memcmps need to be adjusted accordingly.  This should
	hopefully resolve Bug#2204.

2003-10-11 10:01  castaglia

	* src/netaddr.c: 
	The BSDs are not the only systems that might provide
	gethostbyname2().  It seems that some Linux kernels have been
	patched to have that function as well.

2003-10-11 09:57  castaglia

	* include/netaddr.h, modules/mod_core.c, src/netaddr.c: 
	Since pr_netaddr_v4mappedv6() returns TRUE or FALSE (or -1 on

2003-10-09 22:37  castaglia

	* include/netaddr.h, src/dirtree.c, src/netaddr.c: 
	Removing the pr_netaddr_get_fqdn() function.  It was only being
	used in one place: to set the main_server->ServerFQDN member. 
	ServerFQDN is used in the logging prefix, and for vhosts, was
	usually the IP address.  With this change, the log prefix for
	entries generated by vhosts will be their DNS names (if possible). 
	It also removes a call to gethostbyname() which on *BSDs might not
	have performed as expected for IPv6 strings.

2003-10-09 18:30  castaglia

	<netinet/ip.h> were not being reported as found and useable in

2003-10-06 00:16  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Be a little more careful in tls_blinding_on(): it's possible that

	* modules/: mod_auth.c, mod_auth_unix.c:

2003-09-28 10:04  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	One of the changes I made to quell a valgrind warning (something
	about reading possibly uninitialized memory, probably due to a
	zero-length path variable in this case) had disastrous side effects
	on directive lookups.  This highlights that the build_dyn_config()
	function needs comments and/or to be rewritten entirely.
	
	Also includes some style cleanup.

2003-09-27 15:16  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2003-09-27 15:13  castaglia

	* configure.in, src/main.c: 
	Some of the pedantic memory cleanups added in 1.2.9rc2, after some
	time spent under valgrind, turn out to affect performance, when a
	session exits, particularly on busy machines.  So I've made these
	checks enabled only when proftpd is compiled using the
	--enable-devel flag.

2003-09-27 13:48  castaglia

	* NEWS, src/bindings.c: 
	Bug#2024 - DefaultServer not functioning properly.  The addition of
	the Bindings API in 1.2.8rc1 broke the DefaultServer directive in
	many configurations.  For inetd-run proftpds, all configured
	<VirtualHost> servers were being treated like they had
	"DefaultServer on", which meant that the last such configured
	server would be used, instead of the true DefaultServer.  For both
	inetd- and standalone-run proftpds, if no exactly matching vhost
	was found for a client, the localhost server (i.e. the "server
	config" vhost) would be used before the DefaultServer vhost.  Both
	problems are fixed by this change.

2003-09-13 16:29  castaglia

	* NEWS, README.IPv6, config.h.in, configure.in, src/netaddr.c: 
	Bug#2167 - getnameinfo() on FreeBSD doesn't support IP address
	lookups.
	
	FreeBSD's struct sockaddr_in and struct sockaddr_in6 have the
	sin_len and sin6_len members.  The code in pr_netaddr_get_addr()
	was not properly initializing these members, and so when those
	structs were given to getnameinfo(), getnameinfo() didn't handle
	them well.  Solaris and Linux don't have these _len members, so the
	problem didn't crop up there.
	
	IPv6 systems whose structs have these _len members are supposed to
	define the SIN6_LEN symbol, by RFC design.  However, it's possible
	that a system not support IPv6 and yet have the sin_len member and
	the getnameinfo() function.  So rather than just rely on SIN6_LEN
	being present, I added an autoconf check for the sin_len member,
	and an IPv4 SIN_LEN symbol.

	appropriate in most module code.

2003-09-07 17:32  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c: 
	Changed some uses of permanent_pool here to be session.pool, as is
	more appropriate in most module code.

2003-09-07 17:31  castaglia

	* include/modules.h, src/modules.c: 
	Removing cruft.  The call_module_auth() and call_module_cmd()
	functions were duplicates of call_module(), so there is no need to
	keep them around.  Also fixed some of the pools being used when
	adding symbols to the stash.  Fixed a bug where the stash pool was
	not being properly allocated from permanent_pool (valgrind found
	this).

2003-09-07 17:29  castaglia

	* include/pool.h, src/pool.c: 
	Cleaning up the pool interface.  The pr_ prefix for initializing
	the pool code, as many of the subsystem initializers are not meant
	to be called by module code; the pr_ suffix is meant to denote the
	API for use by module authors.	Also fixed a possible
	alarm-blocking bug in destroy_pool().

2003-09-07 17:26  castaglia

	* include/inet.h, src/inet.c: 
	Removing cruft.  The iplist/niplist members of the conn_t struct

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Another leak fixed.  In this case, listdir() was (inappropriately)
	setting pointers in the array--allocated and returned by
	sreaddir()--to NULL.  Those pointers were allocated using calloc()
	in sreaddir(), which meant that later, when listdir() went to free
	the memory, it couldn't -- the address was lost.  All better now.

	* src/pool.c: 
	Rename xmalloc, xcalloc, and xrealloc to be smalloc, scalloc, and
	srealloc ("s" for "safe", just like sstrncpy and sstrcat).  This
	moves these functions out of the way of dmalloc's symbols (and
	doesn't hurt proftpd at all).

	* NEWS, include/bindings.h, src/bindings.c: 
	Bug#2146 - DNS names not handled properly when --enable-ipv6 is
	used.  As mentioned in the report, this was caused by a design
	assumption revealed by the addition of IPv6 support: that of a
	one-to-one association between a server_rec and its listening
	connection.  For DNS names resolving to A and AAAA records, there
	can be two listening connections for a given server_rec.  The fix
	occurs in the Bindings API, where a server_rec's listeners are now
	associated with the bindings for the server_rec, rather than with
	the server_rec itself.	Multiple bindings can point to the same
	server_rec.

	* NEWS, contrib/mod_ifsession.c: 
	Fixed mod_ifsession's handling of multiple configuration sets.	The
	problem was that mod_ifsession, after merging in the configuration
	from a config_rec, would call xaset_remove() and remove that
	config_rec from the main server's configuration sets.  This had the
	side effect of making other config_recs in the set, in the set
	after the removed config_rec, no longer visible by the iterating
	function.  As in Perl: don't change the items in a list while
	iterating over it.  Instead, queue up the changes you want to make
	while iterating, wait until finished iterating, and then change the
	list.

	ignoring any configured classifiers on Max{Retrieve,Store}FileSize

	* contrib/mod_sql.c, modules/mod_log.c: 
	Adding new LogFormat variable, %J (and mod_sql support for it). 
	This variable expands to the arguments given in an FTP command. 
	Currently, there is %m for just the command, %r for the full
	command (command + arguments), but nothing for just the arguments. 
	Hence the need for a new variable.

2003-05-30 17:07  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Changed handling of RNTO slightly.  It would clear session.xfer.p
	at the end of the CMD phase.  Unfortunately, this meant that for
	ExtendedLog/SQLLog, which might want to use %f for RNTO, the path
	allocated from that pool would be gone.  Now, a LOG_CMD/LOG_CMD_ERR
	handler for RNTO does the clearing of session.xfer.p for RNTO, thus
	letting mod_log/mod_sql have a chance to do their stuff.

	configure script by actually testing use of printf(3), rather than
	relying on _FILE_OFFSET_BITS (which some platforms don't use) or
	SIZEOF_OFFSET_T (which doesn't convey the host printf()'s ability

	caught by xfer_err_cleanup().  Still, at least the code will be

	doing:
	
	  CFLAGS="-DPR_DEVEL_NO_FORK -DPR_DEVEL_COREDUMP" ./configure
	--enable-devel ...

	started, else the new daemon will complain of the scoreboard being
	too old.  (I think this is what we are seeing now with people
	upgrading from 1.2.7 to 1.2.8; it's the first time in who knows how

	Changing way mod_radius looks up custom attributes in response

	mod_radius will use VSA IDs.  The new RadiusVendor directive is
	used to configure the vendor for which mod_radius will search.	The

	Modifying the checking of configuration paths slightly.  Rather
	than now only accepting absolute paths (criterion: string begins
	with '/'), paths that start with any of the paths registered with
	the FSIO layer will be accepted.  This allows FSIO modules to
	register handlers for paths that may not necessarily be local

	Adding yet another module callback registration set of functions. 
	This set is for allowing modules to register callbacks that are

	when you want to make sure that the daemon process is affected,
	e.g. adding a timer.  Calling alarm(3) in a module_init function
	won't work for standalone daemons, for part of the daemonizing
	process involves forking() twice (to dissociate the process
	completely from the terminal), and all pending alarms are cleared
	for a child process.

	address/port collisions.  The second is the more likely of the

	* contrib/mod_sql_postgres.c: 
	Postgres added a string-escaping function at some point, so just as
	mod_sql_mysql does, now mod_sql_postgres will make use of its
	library-provided function.
	
	Note that a manual #define had to be used, to ensure backward
	compatibility with Postgres installations that don't have the
	escape function.  Ideally a configure script could check for the
	function; this is yet another case for having proftpd's build
	system support per-module build directories and scripts.

	* contrib/mod_sql.c, include/modules.h, src/modules.c: 
	Formalizing the use of "hooks", which are custom cmdtable entries
	that contrib modules can add.  mod_sql started the trend with its
	"sql_lookup" and "sql_change" hooks.  This patch makes sure that
	any such hooks will not be accidentally used; it was possible, if a
	custom hook was entered that has an all uppercase name, for a
	client to send an FTP command that matched that name, leading to a
	possible bad interaction.
	
	This patch avoids the above scenario by defining a new symbol tag,
	PR_SYM_HOOK, to be used for "hook" cmdtable entries.  I'll add
	documentation about this in the Developer's Guide as appropriate.

	Actually check for a negative return value from the module

2003-01-13 11:20  castaglia

	* src/data.c: 
	Fixing the timing of setting of socket options.  The
	tcpReceiveWindow and tcpSendWindow configuration directives were
	not taking effect properly because setsockopt(2) was being called,
	for the data connection, _after_ the TCP handshake was done.  As it
	is during the handshake when such things as window sizes are
	negotiated, this timing rendered any configuration settings
	useless.

2003-01-13 10:25  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	As John pointed out, it's better to have run-time generated files,
	much like coredumps, to be under RUN_DIR (/var/run/proftpd), or
	CORE_DIR (although CORE_DIR is #defined to be RUN_DIR).  So now,
	the profiling gmon.out and bb.out files will be found there, rather
	than /tmp.
	
	Thanks, John! =)

2003-01-12 21:38  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, modules/mod_core.c, src/main.c: 
	Added DEVEL_NO_DAEMON define, and changed other DEBUG_* defines to
	match.	The purpose for these is to be able to build a proftpd
	daemon that can be profiled.  Now, one can have a configure
	statement such as:
	
	  CFLAGS="-DDEVEL_NO_DAEMON -DDEVEL_NO_FORK -g -pg -a" \
	    LIBS="-pg" ./configure ...
	
	The resulting daemon will only handle one session.  The bb.out and
	gmon.out profiling files will be written to /tmp.

	The distinction for which I am striving is to have all the
	functions that module developers should use to be prefixed with
	pr_; public functions may be available without a pr_ prefix, but
	such functions will be intended for use by the core code only.
	
	Also, more in the RFC2228 support department:
	
	  session_t has a new field, rfc2228_mech.  This is to be filled in
	by
	  the RFC2228 module that handles an AUTH command, so that other
	  RFC2228 modules, should they be higher in the module load order,
	know
	  not to process RFC2228 commands meant for the handling module.
	
	  The response formatting callback function now takes an additional
	  parameter, a pool pointer, as the first argument.  The pool that
	will
	  be passed to that function will be the same pool used by the
	other
	  response functions.

	or
	
	  <Global>
	  </Global>
	
	appear in the configuration file.  These empty sets are useless,
	and serve only to use up memory unnecessarily; that memory usage is
	compounded when directives are merged down into these sets.

	Returning ERROR from an auth handler (specifically, in an "auth" or

	ERROR macro sets a value of 1, and the switch() case in mod_auth
	looks for negative values.  So, to handle this case, I've added
	PR_AUTH_ERROR return value (-1) for auth handlers that encounter

	* include/options.h, lib/glibc-glob.c: 
	These changes make it possible to tune the maximum number of
	recursion levels supported when globbing.  A better way of dealing
	with possible DoS attacks via globbing is via the RLimit*
	directives, or to disable globbing support altogether by using the
	UseGlobbing directive.	However, in some cases it may be necessary
	to support globbing, but to do so in as restrictive a manner as
	possible.
	
	The default maximum number of levels supported by GNU's globbing is
	8.  This patch keeps that default, but allows the administrator, if
	need be, to tune that level lower by means of the
	PR_TUNABLE_GLOBBING_MAX macro, defined in include/options.h.  When
	compiling proftpd, it can be defined to some lower value, e.g.:
	
	  CFLAGS="-DPR_TUNABLE_GLOBBING_MAX=2" ./configure ...

	Solaris, the utilities did not compile.  The modifications

	be like that of the main proftpd binary, which consequently is

2002-07-26 10:02  castaglia

	* src/: dirtree.c, main.c, support.c: 
	Fixed minor HUP memory leak, caused by use of schedule() to
	schedule an invocation of main_rehash().  A sched_t object is
	allocated for the scheduling from permanent_pool, but that object
	is never freed.  The fix was to add a pool member to the sched_t
	struct, allocated a subpool from permanent_pool, allocate the
	sched_t struct from that subpool, and assign the subpool to the
	struct's pool member.  That way, the sched_t object can be
	destroyed once the scheduled callback has been invoked.  Also
	cleaned up some of the main_rehash() code, to make it more legible.

2002-06-27 15:09  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Convert some of the configuration handlers to allocating memory for
	passing numeric values, rather than squeezing them into void *. 
	This fixes a border case where using 0 as the value for
	SQLDefault{UID,GID} or SQLMinUser{ID,UID,GID} would cause that
	directive setting to not be honored; a value of zero cast as a void
	* means that that void * would most likely be interpreted as NULL
	upon retrieval.

2002-06-25 10:35  castaglia

	* include/conf.h: 
	Add checking of SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG to the list of macros
	used for determining when to use %lu and when to use %llu.  FreeBSD
	does not require the other macros used (_FILE_OFFSET_BITS or
	_LARGE_FILES), and so this additional check (which assumes that if
	the size of an unsigned long long is 8 bytes, the underlying
	platform will support use of %llu -- and we all know what happens
	when one assumes) is required for proper LFS detection and support
	on FreeBSD (and perhaps other platforms?).

2002-06-25 10:17  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c:

	* configure.in: 
	
	TJ: being pedantic, changing the order of functions check to be
	alphabetical.	   Also, I need to check configure.in separately
	from, and before, configure.	  This is so that when users
	download from CVS, and run ./configure && make,      the make
	program's check of the timestamp on configure.in shows an     
	earlier date on configure.in than on configure (if both
	configure.in and      configure are checked into CVS
	simultaneously, they will have the same      timestamps, and make
	will cause the configure script to be run again).      What a pain.
