                    1.3.5 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.3.5 release cycle, from the 1.3.5rc1 release to the 1.3.5 maintenance
releases.  More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and
ChangeLog files.

1.3.5
---------

  + TLS 1.1/1.2 configuration now works properly.

  + New Configuration Directives

    RLimitChroot
      When proftpd chroots a session (e.g. via DefaultRoot or <Anonymous>),
      certain attacks become possible, such as the "Roaring Beast" attack:

        http://auscert.org.au/15286
        https://auscert.org.au/15526

      To help mitigate these attacks, proftpd now rejects any attempt to do
      a write of any kind to paths under /etc and /lib, when the session is
      chrooted to a path other than "/".

      If these restrictions cause problems for any sites, this guard can be
      disabled via the new RLimitChroot directive, e.g.:

        RLimitChroot off

      See doc/modules/mod_rlimit.html#RLimitChroot for more information.


  + Changed Configuration Directives

    SFTPOptions AllowInsecureLogin
      Some SFTP clients may wish to use the 'none' cipher, and/or 'none' digest,
      for testing purposes.  For example, disabling the cipher and digest can
      be used for testing the raw transfer speed over SFTP.

      mod_sftp, by default, will not allow connections which attempt to use the
      'none' cipher or 'none' digest, even if these are explicitly enabled via
      the SFTPCiphers and SFTPDigests directive, as use of these algorithms
      disables the security protections on the transferred data (such as
      username/password).

      Thus to explicitly allow usage for these insecure algorithms, use:

        SFTPOptions AllowInsecureLogin

      See doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPOptions for details.

    SQLPasswordPBKDF2 sql://
      The mod_sql_passwd module now supports retrieval of PBKDF2 parameters,
      such as algorithm, iteration count, and output length, on a per-user
      basis, via a SQLNamedQuery, in addition to staticly configured
      parameters.

      See doc/contrib/mod_sql_passwd.html#SQLPasswordPBKDF2 for details.


1.3.5rc4
---------

  + Fixed mod_sftp/mod_sftp_pam memory allocation (CVE-2013-4359).
  + Added support for SSCN FTP command, for secure site-to-site (FXP) transfers.
  + Added support for Elliptic Curve (EC) suites to mod_tls.
  + Fixed handling of LDFLAGS settings for module builds
  + Changed log levels on many log messages, in order to have more consistently
    applied log levels when logging.

  + New Modules

    mod_dnsbl
      The mod_dnsbl module can be used to provide connection access control
      using DNS "blacklists", i.e. denying connections from clients which
      are known "bad" addresses/networks.  See doc/contrib/mod_dnsbl.html
      for more information.


  + New Configuration Directives

    LDAPLog
      The mod_ldap module now supports the LDAPLog directive, for directing
      all of the mod_ldap logging to a file.  More details can be found at
      doc/contrib/mod_ldap.html#LDAPLog.

    TLSECCertificateFile, TLSECCertificateKeyFile
      The mod_tls module now supports Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptography.
      These ciphers and algorithms require an EC certificate/key, which
      are configured with these new directives.  See the
      doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSECCertificateFile and
      doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSECCertificateKeyFile for more information.

    TLSVerifyServer
      The mod_tls module now supports secure FXP (site-to-site) transfers
      via the SSCN FTP command.  Since mod_tls now acts as a client for
      part of these transfers, there is a new TLSVerifyServer directive
      that controls how mod_tls will verify the certificate of the remote
      server.  See doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSVerifyServer for details.


  + Changed Configuration Directives

    CapabilitiesSet
      Some sites use directories with the SGID bit set, and to preserve the
      SGID bit on directories created in these directories, on Linux systems,
      the mod_cap module either needs to be disabled, OR it needs to support
      the CAP_FSETID capability.

      The CapabilitiesSet directive now handles the CAP_FSETID capability,
      which is not enabled by default.  To enable its use, you would use the
      following in your proftpd.conf:

        <IfModule mod_cap.c>
          CapabilitiesSet +CAP_FSETID
        </IfModule>

      See doc/contrib/mod_cap.html#CapabilitiesSet for more information.

    ExecOnEvent
      Executed commands can now be executed with the privileges of the
      logged-in user using the '~' notation in the ExecOnEvent directive;
      see doc/contrib/mod_exec.html#ExecOnEvent for details.

      The ExecOnEvent directive is now supported in the <VirtualHost>
      and <Global> contexts, as well as the "server config" default context.

    LogFormat, SQLLog
      The %s LogFormat variable is now properly resolved for SFTP transfers.

      The %D/%d LogFormat variables are now properly resolved for directory
      listings, for both FTP and SFTP sessions.

      There is a new LogFormat variable, %{basename}, for logging the last
      component of a path, <i>i.e.</i> just the file/directory name.

    PersistentPasswd 
      The PersistentPasswd directive now defaults to 'off'.  See
      doc/modules/mod_auth_unix.html#PersistentPasswd for more information.

    SFTPOptions
      To prevent users from changing the timestamp of their files
      uploaded via SCP, the SFTPOptions directive
      (doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPOptions) now supports an
      IgnoreSCPUploadTimes parameter.

    SQLOptions
      In some environments (e.g. those with very strict policies such as
      SELinux, or perhaps memory-constrained environments), mod_sql needs
      to be told to not try to read any database-specific configuration
      files.  For this, the SQLOptions directive now supports the
      IgnoreConfigFile parameter; see doc/contrib/mod_sql.html#SQLOptions.


  + Changed Utilities

    ftpasswd
      The ftpasswd utility has two new command-line options, --lock and
      --unlock, for "administratively" locking/unlocking specific accounts,
      akin to the functionality offered by passwd(1).

      The ftpasswd utility also now checks for concurrent modifications:
      only one process can be modifying the target files at a time.


  + New Documentation

    We went through ProFTPD source code with an eye toward logged messages,
    wanting to make sure that similar types of messages were consistently
    logged at the same level.  With this, we can now provide documentation
    which describes the messages logged at each log level, along with
    a catalog of the most common log messages and what they mean.  See
    doc/howto/LogLevels.html and doc/howto/LogMessages.html, respsectively.

    A new howto for the mod_radius module, including some example FreeRADIUS
    configurations, has been added; see doc/howto/Radius.html.

 
1.3.5rc3
---------

  + Fixed mod_sql "SQLAuthType Backend" MySQL issues
  + HideUser/HideGroup now work as expected for virtual users

  + New Modules

    mod_snmp
      The mod_snmp module is intended to collect various state information
      and expose them via SNMP counters and gauges.  Currently only
      SNMPv1/SNMPv2 are supported.  See doc/contrib/mod_snmp.html for more
      information.


  + New Configuration Directives

    SQLUserPrimaryKey, SQLGroupPrimaryKey
      The mod_sql module now has directives for specifying primary key
      columns for user/group data; these can be used for storing user/group
      values in tables which require foreign key constraints.  See
      doc/howto/SQL.html#SQLPrimaryKeys for a more detailed description
      and use cases for these directives.

    SQLPasswordPBKDF2
      The mod_sql_passwd module now supports handling passwords encrypted
      using the PBKDF2 algorithm.  See
      doc/contrib/mod_sql_passwd.html#SQLPasswordPBKDF2 for more information.


  + Changed Configuration Directives

    DeleteAbortedStores
      To preserve the principle of least surprise, the behavior of the
      DeleteAbortedStores directive has been changed slightly.  Specifically,
      DeleteAbortedStores is automatically enabled now whenever
      "HiddenStores on" is configured.

    LogFormat, SQLLog
      The LogFormat and SQLLog directives now supports a %g variable, for
      logging the name of the primary group of the logged-in user.
      See doc/modules/mod_log.html#LogFormat.

    SFTPDigests
      The mod_sftp module now supports UMAC as an SSH digest algorithm,
      using the digest name as used by OpenSSH, i.e. "umac-64@openssh".
      Support for this digest is automatically enabled where supported.
      See doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPDigests for details.

    SFTPExtensions fsync
      The mod_sftp module now supports the custom "fsync@openssh"
      SFTP extension, for handling fsync requests from SFTP clients that
      need to ensure that any buffered uploaded data has been flushed out
      to the backing store on the server.  See
      doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPExtensions for details.    


1.3.5rc2
---------

  + New Modules

    mod_log_forensic
      The mod_log_forensic module is intended to collect logging information
      while a session runs, but only to write that log information out to
      a file when certain conditions happen, and thus to avoid logging
      redundant information for "normal" sessions.  See
      doc/contrib/mod_log_forensic.html for more information.

    mod_rlimit
      The handling of the RLimitCPU, RLimitMemory, and RLimitOpenFiles
      directives were refactored into a new mod_rlimit module.  This module
      also automatically sets the RLIMIT_NPROC resource limit for session
      processes (as a protective measure).  See doc/modules/mod_rlimit.html
      for details.


  + New Configuration Directives

    GeoIPPolicy
      The GeoIPPolicy directive for the mod_geoip module is used to configure
      the default allow/deny policy of the module, when evaluating any
      configured GeoIPFilters.  See doc/contrib/mod_geoip.html#GeoIPPolicy.

    TLSMasqueradeAddress
      There are particular situations where MasqueradeAddress functionality
      is needed, but *only for FTPS connections*.  For these situations,
      use the new TLSMasqueradeAddress directive; see
      doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSMasqueradeAddress for details.

    TLSUserName
      The mod_tls module can now be configured to authenticate users based
      on contents of a client-provided certificate (assuming the client
      provided one).  By using:

       TLSVerifyClient on

      and the new TLSUserName directive, mod_tls may verify the user
      without requiring a password.  See doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSUserName.


  + Changed Configuration Directives

    AuthUserFile, AuthGroupFile
      The mod_auth_file module is now more strict about the permissions
      on configured AuthUserFile and AuthGroupFile, and about the permissions
      of the directories containing these files.  These restrictions are to
      prevent accidental (or malicious) altering of these files by any
      user on the system.  See
      doc/modules/mod_auth_file.html#AuthFilePermissions for a discussion
      of these new restrictions.

    BanOnEvent TLSHandshake
      There is a particular type of Denial-of-Service attack where malicious
      clients request just enough of an SSL/TLS handshake to cause the server
      to perform the expensive decryption operations; if this happens
      frequently enough, the server will consume much of its CPU, thus
      starving other clients.  See:

        http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2011-ssl-dos-mitigation.html
        http://www.thc.org/thc-ssl-dos/

      The BanOnEvent directive now supports a TLSHandshake rule, to impose
      bans on such clients.

    HiddenStores
      The default "." suffix used for HiddenStores filenames can now be
      customised.  See doc/modules/mod_xfer.html#HiddenStores.

    LogFormat
      The LogFormat directive now supports variables for timestamps with
      millisecond and microsecond granularity, via %{millisecs} and
      %{microsecs}, respectively.  In addition, a new shorthand variable,
      %{iso8601}, is supported.  See doc/modules/mod_log.html#LogFormat.

      Important note: the new %{iso8601} timestamp format is *also* now the
      timestamp format used for the default system logging that proftpd uses.

    TLSProtocol
      Almost all of the mod_tls configuration directives can be configured
      on a per-<VirtualHost> basis, except for the TLSProtocol directive.
      This has now been corrected, such that TLSProtocol can be set on
      a per-<VirtualHost> basis (and is also allowed in <Global> sections).

    TLSSessionCache
      The default SSL session cache timeout, when no explicit timeout has
      been configured, has been increased to be slightly longer than the
      default control channel renegotiation timeout.  This means that the
      out-of-the-box mod_tls behavior will be better for FTPS clients that
      have long-lived (i.e. on the order of multiple hours) sessions.


  + Logging Format changes

    Note that the logging format for SystemLog, TraceLog, and all per-module
    log files has changed.  Specifically, the log lines now have an ISO-8601
    timestamp format, so that they now look like:

      2013-01-31 15:33:03,832

    instead of:

      Jan 31 15:33:03

    The new format does not use textual month abbreviations, and includes
    milliseconds in the timestamp, for finer-grained logging granularity.

    NOTE: This WILL have impact on sites using DenyHosts, banhosts, fail2ban,
    depending on the configured log recognition patterns used by those
    applications.


1.3.5rc1
---------

  + Added support for SHA-256, SHA-512 password hashes to the ftpasswd tool
  + Many mod_sftp bugfixes
  + Added Japanese and Spanish translations

  + New Modules

    mod_geoip
      The mod_geoip module provides lookup of geographic information based
      on the IP address of the connecting client.  This information can
      be logged, and used to drop the connection if necessary.  See
      doc/contrib/mod_geoip.html for complete information.


  + Changed Modules

    mod_sftp
      The mod_sftp module now supports use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography
      (ECC).  This includes ECDSA host keys and user keys, and the ECDH
      key exchange method.

      Improved FIPS support in mod_sftp.

      The mod_sftp module now honors the MaxStoreFileSize directive.


  + New Configuration Directives:

    AllowChrootSymlinks
      By default, when chrooting a process (via the DefaultRoot directive
      or for <Anonymous> logins), proftpd will follow a symlink.  Some sites
      wish to restrict this; for these sites, there is the new
      AllowChrootSymlinks directive.  See
      doc/modules/mod_auth.html#AllowChrootSymlinks for details.

    CapabilitiesRootRevoke
      The mod_cap module now completely drops root privileges; the retained
      Linux capabilities should suffice.  To revert to the previous behavior,
      use this new CapabilitiesRootRevoke directive; see
      doc/modules/mod_cap.html#CapabilitiesRootRevoke.

    <IfAuthenticated>
      There are times when a site might wish to have directives that apply
      <b>only</b> to sessions once the user has been authenticated, and not
      before then.  The mod_ifsession module now provides this ability via
      the <IfAuthenticated> section; see
      doc/contrib/mod_ifsession.html#IfAuthenticated.

    FactsOptions
      The FactsOptions directive is used to tweak the outputs used by
      the mod_facts module for the MLSD/MLST output.  One such option is
      UseSlink, which provides better compatibility with the output expected
      e.g. by FileZilla.  The doc/modules/mod_facts.html#FactsOptions
      description has more details.

    QuotaDefault
      The QuotaDefault directive is used to provide a "default" quota,
      via the mod_quotatab module, if mod_quotatab is unable to find a
      quota for the logging-in user.  See
      doc/contrib/mod_quotatab.html#QuotaDefault for details.

    RewriteMaxReplace
      The RewriteMaxReplace directive is used to change the number of
      replacements that mod_rewrite will do when rewriting commands.  See
      doc/contrib/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteMaxReplace for more details.

    TLSServerCipherPreference
      This directive can be used to configure mod_tls so that the server
      ciphersuites are preferred, rather than preferring the client
      ciphersuites.  See doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSServerCipherPreference
      for more information.


  + Changed Configuration Directives

    AllowFilter, DenyFilter
      The "[NC]" (or "[nocase]") case-insensitive flags for the PathAllowFilter
      and PathDenyFilter directives have now been extended to apply to the
      AllowFilter and DenyFilter directives as well.  For example:

        AllowFilter \.html [NC]
        DenyFilter \.jpg$ [nocase]

    CreateHome
      When creating a home directory via the CreateHome directive, proftpd
      will automatically use root privileges, in order to create the
      necessary directories with configured ownership and permissions.
      However, for some sites which use e.g. NFS, use of root privileges
      will cause problems.  For such situations, the CreateHome directive
      now supports a NoRootPrivs parameter; see doc/howto/CreateHome.html
      for examples.

    ListOptions
      The mod_ls module now supports the -1 option (list one file per line),
      which can also be configured via the ListOptions directive.

      The ListOptions directive now supports new "LISTOnly" and "NLSTOnly"
      keywords, for applying the restrictions only to the LIST (or NLST)
      FTP commands.

    LogFormat
      The LogFormat directive can now handle logging variables of the format
      %{note:<name>}, where <name> refers to an internal "note" name.  The
      supported names vary depending on the various modules.  In most cases,
      these note names are not useful for general purpose logging, however.

    RewriteCondition, RewriteRule
      The RewriteCondition and RewriteRule directives of the mod_rewrite
      module now support time-related variables; see
      doc/contrib/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteCondition for more information.

    RootRevoke
      The RootRevoke directive now supports a "UseNonCompliantActiveTransfers"
      parameter, for dropping root privileges BUT still allowing active
      data transfers by using a non-standard source port for the active
      transfer.  See doc/modules/mod_auth.html#RootRevoke for more information.

    ScoreboardFile
      Some sites have found that maintaining the ScoreboardFile can lead to
      a fair amount of overhead.  Those sites who wish to remove this overhead
      can now disable use of the ScoreboardFile altogether by using:

        ScoreboardFile off

      Note that doing so means that certain configuration directives (e.g.
      MaxClients) and certain tools (e.g. ftptop, ftpwho, ftpcount) will no
      longer work.  See doc/modules/mod_core.html#ScoreboardFile for details.

    ServerIdent
      The ServerIdent directive is now honored by the mod_sftp module.
      For example, you can configure mod_sftp to not provide any version
      information at all, or to provide a different server name/token
      altogether; see doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPVersionId.

    SFTPDigests
      The SFTPDigests directive (see doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPDigests)
      now handles/supports the SHA-256 and SHA-512 digest algorithms.

    SFTPHostKey
      The mod_sftp module can now load its host keys from an SSH agent
      process such as OpenSSH ssh-agent(1) tool; see
      doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPHostKey for details.

    SFTPOptions
      To prevent users from changing the ownership of their files via SFTP,
      the SFTPOptions directive (doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPOptions) now
      supports an IgnoreSFTPSetOwners parameter.

    SocketOptions
      The SocketOptions directive (see doc/modules/mod_core.html#SocketOptions)
      now supports a new "keepalive" parameter, for tuning the TCP keepalive
      behavior.  A more detailed explanation of TCP keepalives, and other
      forms of keepalive, is provided in doc/howto/KeepAlives.html.

    SQLLog, LogFormat
      The LogFormat and SQLLog directives support two new logging variables:
      %{transfer-status} and %{transfer-failure}.  The %{transfer-status}
      variable indicates the status of a data transfer: "success", "failed",
      "cancelled", "timeout", or "-" (if not applicable).  The
      %{transfer-failure} variable indicates the reason for the data transfer
      failure, or "-" if there was no failure.

    SystemLog
      The SystemLog can now be disabled via <IfClass>, e.g. for disabling
      logging for specific clients.

    TLSCipherSuite
      The default SSL/TLS ciphersuites offered/used by mod_tls have changed
      from "ALL:!ADH" to a more secure ordering of "DEFAULT:!ADH:!EXPORT:!DES".

    TLSProtocol
      When compiled using OpenSSL 1.0.1 or later, the TLSProtocol directive
      can be used to specify TLS versionf "TLSv1.1" and "TLSv1.2".

    UseEncoding
      When the UseEncoding directive (doc/modules/mod_lang.html#UseEncoding)
      is used to specify encodings, it used to require that the client use
      these encodings, and not allow clients to request different encodings.
      This requirement is now related.  To preserve the old behavior, a
      new "strict" keyword is supported; the directive documentation covers
      this in more details.

    <VirtualHost>, MasqueradeAddress, DefaultAddress
      All of these directives can now take an interface name, in addition
      to DNS names or IP addresses, to be resolved to an IP address.  This
      is useful in cases where the same proftpd.conf needs to be deployed or
      shared across a cluster; each machine has the same interface name which
      handles different IP addresses.

      Examples:

        DefaultAddress lo0
        MasqueradeAddress eth0

        <VirtualHost eth0>
          ...
        </VirtualHost>


  + Changed Command Handling

    PORT/EPRT
      When handling PORT and EPRT FTP commands from clients, proftpd now
      checks for RFC 1918 addresses in those commands; these are non-publicly
      routable IP addresses, and should NOT be being sent by clients.  When
      proftpd detects these RFC1918 addresses being used for a WAN server
      address, then proftpd will ignore the RFC1918 address, and instead
      use the IP address of the connecting client.  This change should help
      interoperability of data transfers for some FTP clients.


  + API Changes

    The session.class struct member has been renamed to session.conn_class.
    This was done to allow for support of C++ modules.  Similarly, the
    cmd_rec.class struct member has been renamed to cmd_rec.cmd_class,
    and cmdtable.class renamed to cmdtable.cmd_class.  See Bug#3079 for
    details.
