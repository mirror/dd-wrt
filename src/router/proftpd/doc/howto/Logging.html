<b>Logging</b><br>
Logging the activity of the server is an integral part of effective server
administration.  ProFTPD provides several different and flexing logging
mechanisms.  When examining the different logging mechanisms, have in
mind the intended use of the logged data, the volume, any post-processing
that may need to be done, etc.  Log files are more useful when they contain a
complete record of server activity. It is often easier to simply post-process
the log files to remove requests that you do not want to consider.  

<p>
<b>Security Warning</b><br>
Anyone who can write to the directory where ProFTPD is writing a log file can
almost certainly gain access to the UID that the server is started under, which
is normally <code>root</code>. <b>Do not</b> give people write access to the
directory where the logs are stored without being aware of the consequences:
if the logs directory is writable (by a non-<code>root</code> user), someone
could replace a log file with a symlink to some other system file, and then
<code>root</code> might overwrite that file with arbitrary data. If the log
files themselves are writable (by a non-<code>root</code> user), then someone
may be able to overwrite the log itself with bogus data.

<p>
When opening log files, <code>proftpd</code> will by default log a warning if
the file being opened for logging is in a directory that does not exist, or
is world-writable.  The log file will <b>not</b> be written in world-writable
directories; there are no exceptions.  (If you have configured log files in
your <code>proftpd.conf</code> that are not appearing, check for the warnings
about world-writable directories.)  The <code>proftpd</code> process will also,
by default, log a warning if the file given is a symlink; this symlink check
can be configured via the <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_AllowLogSymlinks.html"><code>AllowLogSymlinks</code></a> directive.

<p>
In addition, log files may contain information supplied directly by the client,
without escaping. Therefore, it is possible for malicious clients to insert
control-characters in the log files, so care must be taken in dealing with
raw logs.

<p><a name="Syslog"></a>
<b><code>syslog</code></b><br>
By default, <code>proftpd</code> will log via <code>syslog(3)</code>, using
the <code>daemon</code> facility (<code>auth</code> for some logging),
at various levels: <code>err</code>, <code>notice</code>, <code>warn</code>,
<code>info</code>, and <code>debug</code> (debugging is done at this syslog
level).  The location of the server's log files in this case is determined by
your <code>/etc/syslog.conf</code> configuration.

<p><a name="LogFiles"></a>
<b><code>Log Files</code></b><br>
There are three main types of logs that a <code>proftpd</code> daemon can
generate: <code>TransferLog</code>s, a <code>SystemLog</code>, and
<code>ExtendedLog</code>s.

<p><a name="TransferLog"></a>
A <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_TransferLog.html"><code>TransferLog</code></a> is the most common log kept, recording file
transfers.  Its format is described in the <code>xferlog(5)</code> man page,
also available <a href="http://www.castaglia.org/proftpd/doc/xferlog.html">here</a>

<p><a name="SystemLog"</a>
If the site administrator wants to have <code>proftpd</code> log its
messages to a file rather than going through <code>syslogd</code>, the
<a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_SystemLog.html"><code>SystemLog</code></a> configuration directive is the one to use.  There
is only one such file kept for the entire daemon.  See the <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_ServerLog.html"><code>ServerLog</code></a> directive for keeping a similar log on a per-vhost basis.

<p><a name="ExtendedLog"></a>
The <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_ExtendedLog.html">ExtendedLog</a> directive is used to create log files of a very
flexible and configurable format, and to have granular control over what is
logged, and when.  The format of an <code>ExtendedLog</code> is described
using the <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_LogFormat.html">LogFormat</a> directive.  Multiple <code>ExtendedLogs</code> can
be configured, each with a different format.

<!-- Add note/chunk about FTP response codes, from RFC959, for ExtendedLog? -->

<p><a name="LogAnalysis"></a>
<b>Log Analysis</b><br>
There are a variety of log analyzers available; these are just a few:
<ul>
  <li>Webalizer: <a href="http://www.webalizer.org/">http://www.webalizer.org/</a>
  <li>HTTP-analyze: <a href="http://www.netstore.de/Supply/http-analyze/">http://www.netstore.de/Supply/http-analyze/</a>
  <li>Analog: <a href="http://www.analog.cx/">http://www.analog.cx/</a>
  <li>Report Magic: <a href="http://www.reportmagic.org/">http://www.reportmagic.org/</a>
  <li>FTPWeblog: <a href="http://www.nihongo.org/snowhare/utilities/ftpweblog/">http://www.nihongo.org/snowhare/utilities/ftpweblog/</a>
</ul>

<p><a name="LogRotation"></a>
<b>Log Rotation</b><br>
On even a moderately busy server, the quantity of information stored in the log
files is very large.  It will consequently be necessary to periodically rotate
the log files by moving or deleting the existing logs. This cannot be done
while the server is running, because the daemon will continue writing to the
old log file as long as it holds the file open.  Instead, the server must be
<a href="Stopping.html">restarted</a> after the log files are moved or deleted
so that it will open new log files.

<p>
Another way to perform log rotation is using <a href="#FIFOs">FIFOs</a> as
discussed in the next section.

<p><a name="FIFOs"></a>
<b>FIFOs (<i>a.k.a.</i> named pipes)</b><br>
ProFTPD is capable of writing log files to FIFOs, from which another
process can read.  Use of this capability dramatically increases the
flexibility of logging, without adding code to the main server.  In order to
write logs to a pipe, simply create the FIFO at the desired path
(<code>man mkfifo(1)</code>), and use that path in the logging configuration
directive.

<p>
One important use of piped logs is to allow log rotation without having to
restart the server.  One such popular flexible log rotation program is
<a href="http://www.ford-mason.co.uk/resources/cronolog/">cronolog</a>;
however, at present cronolog requires a small patch to enable it to read
from a FIFO (by default, cronolog reads data from stdin).  Please contact
the author of this article for details concerning the patch.

<p>
Here's an example of FIFO-based logging script, based on one posted by Michael
Renner:
<pre>
  #!/usr/bin/perl

  use strict;

  use File::Basename qw(basename);
  use Sys::Syslog qw(:DEFAULT setlogsock);

  my $program = basename($0);

  my $fifo = '/var/log/proftpd-log.fifo';
  my $syslog_facility = 'daemon';
  my $syslog_level = 'info';

  open(FIFO, "< $fifo") or die "$program: unable to open $fifo: $!\n";

  setlogsock 'unix';

  openlog($program, 'pid', $syslog_facility);
  syslog($syslog_level, $_) while (<FIFO>);
  closelog();

  close(FIFO);
  exit 0;
</pre>
More complex filtering can be added to such scripts.  

<p>
If using FIFOs, there are some caveats to keep in mind.  If you use in
<code>init.d</code> script to start <code>standalone</code> daemons, you can
add commands to start the FIFO logging programs first, before the daemon.
For <code>inetd</code>-run servers, consider wrapping up the necessary
commands for starting a FIFO reader and the server into a simple shell
script, or simply run the FIFO-reading program from an <code>init.d</code>
script, and save the overhead of starting that process, in addition to the
<code>proftpd</code> process, for each FTP session.

<p>
FIFO-based log readers are a very powerful tool, but they should not be
used where a simpler solution like off-line post-processing is available.

<p><a name="SQLLogging"></a>
<b>SQL Logging</b><br>
The <code>mod_sql</code> module also enables some powerful and complex
logging capabilities...

<p><a name="PidFile"></a>
<b>Pid File</b><br>
On startup, <code>proftpd</code> saves the process ID of the parent daemon
process to the file <code>var/proftpd/proftpd.pid</code>. This filename can be
changed with the <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_PidFile.html">PidFile</a> directive. The process ID (<i>aka</i> PID) is for
use by the administrator in restarting and terminating the daemon by sending
signals to the parent process.  For more information see the
<a href="Stopping.html">stopping and starting</a> page.

<p>
<b>Scoreboard File</b><br>
The last type of &quot;logging&quot; is done via the scoreboard file.  The
scoreboard is binary-formatted file the server uses to store information
about each session; it is this file that is read by <code>ftptop</code>,
<code>ftpwho</code> and <code>ftpcount</code>.  The location for the
scoreboard file is determined by the
<a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_ScoreboardFile.html"><code>ScoreboardFile</code></a> directive.
