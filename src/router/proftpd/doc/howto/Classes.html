<b>What are Classes?</b><br>
When configuring <code>proftpd</code>, it is sometimes nice, or even necessary,
to tag or label a client as belonging to some group, based on that client's
IP address or DNS hostname.  A &quot;class&quot; is the name for such
connection-based groupings in ProFTPD terms.  A class is defined to have
a <em>name</em>, and as having certain criteria such as IP addresses, IP
subnets/masks, and DNS hostnames.  A client that connects to the daemon
that has matching characteristics is then labeled as belonging to that class.

<p>
<b>How are Classes Defined?</b><br>
To define a class, use a <code>&lt;Class&gt;</code> section in your
<code>proftpd.conf</code>:
<pre>
  &lt;Class internal&gt;
    From 192.168.0.0/16
  &lt;/Class&gt;
</pre>
This defines a class named &quot;internal&quot;; any client connecting from
192.168.0.0/16 will belong to this class.  And if you wanted to define a
class for all clients not connecting from 192.168.0.0/16 address space:
<pre>
  &lt;Class external&gt;
    From !192.168.0.0/16
  &lt;/Class&gt;
</pre>
A more complicated class might include matching DNS names as well:
<pre>
  &lt;Class test&gt;
    From 1.2.3.4
    From proxy.*.com
    From my.example.com
    From 5.6.7.8
  &lt;/Class&gt;
</pre>
This &quot;test&quot; class will then be used for a client with any of the
defined characteristics.

<p>
Note that if your class rules use only DNS names, and <code>proftpd</code>
is unable to resolve the IP address of a client to a DNS name, that
class may not be matched as you might expect.  This can be seen in
the server debugging output, at level 10, as something like:
<pre>
  comparing DNS name '1.2.3.4' to pattern 'proxy.*.com'
</pre>
Here you see the 1.2.3.4 IP address, where a DNS name should be.  In order
for DNS name based class rules to function properly, both a) DNS resolution
is needed (<i>i.e.</i> <code>UseReverseDNS</code> must be <em>on</em>, which
is the default), and b) the IP address of a connecting client must be
resolvable to a DNS name.

<p>
What if there are multiple classes defined, and the classes overlap, <i>e.g.</i>
two classes both have:
<pre>
  From *.example.com
</pre>
Which one will be used for the connecting client?  This will depend on the
order in which classes are defined in the <code>proftpd.conf</code> file.
When searching the list of classes for the one that matches the client,
<code>proftpd</code> checks each class in the order in which they are defined.
The first class definition that matches is used.

<p>
How do you define a class that includes all clients from a certain
domain <b>except</b> one specific host in that domain?  To define a class with
these sorts of characteristics, use the <code>Satisfy</code> configuration
directive:
<pre>
  &lt;Class foo&gt;
    From *.example.com
    From !bad.example.com
    Satisfy all
  &lt;/Class&gt;
</pre>

<p>
<b>How are Classes Used?</b><br>
By itself, a class does nothing.  It is merely a way to define a set of clients
and to give that set a name.  Once that name is defined, though, it can be
use as part of your configuration.  There are a limited number of configuration
directives that make use of classes directly:
<ul>
  <li><code>AllowClass</code>
  <li><code>DenyClass</code>
  <li><code>DisplayGoAway</code>
  <li><code>MaxClientsPerClass</code>
</ul>
The <code>AllowClass</code> and <code>DenyClass</code> directives are the
main directives to use, for example in <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> sections:
<pre>
  &lt;Limit ALL&gt;
    AllowClass internal
    DenyAll
  &lt;/Limit&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.castaglia.org/proftpd/modules/mod_ifsession.html"><code>mod_ifsession</code></a> module also makes use of classes with its
<code>&lt;IfClass&gt;</code> configuration section.  Using classes and
<code>mod_ifsession</code>, you can write a <code>proftpd.conf</code> that
has specific configurations for specific classes of clients.  Here's an
example snippet demonstrating use of <code>&lt;IfClass&gt;</code>:
<pre>
  &lt;IfClass internal&gt;
    MaxClients 100
  &lt;/IfClass&gt;

  &lt;IfClass !internal&gt;
    MaxClients 25
  &lt;/IfClass&gt;
</pre>
This allows clients from class &quot;internal&quot; to see an effective
<code>MaxClients</code> limit of 100 simultaneous clients, and clients
<b>not</b> in class &quot;internal&quot; to see an effective limit of only 25.
