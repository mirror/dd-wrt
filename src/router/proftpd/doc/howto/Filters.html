<p>
ProFTPD supports the ability to &quot;filter&quot; the FTP commands it receives
from the client.  These filters are written as
<a href="Regex.html">regular expressions</a>.  This means that while the
filters can be very powerful, they can also be complex and harder to construct.

<p>
First, there are the <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_AllowFilter.html"><code>AllowFilter</code></a> and <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_DenyFilter.html"><code>DenyFilter</code></a> configuration directives.  These configuration directives are used
to set filters on <b>every</b> FTP command.  If an <code>AllowFilter</code> is
used, the command parameters <b>must</b> match the given filter, otherwise the
command will be denied.  If a <code>DenyFilter</code> is used, the command
parameters <b>must not</b> match the given filter, otherwise the command will
be denied.  If both <code>AllowFilter</code> and <code>DenyFilter</code> are
used, then the <code>AllowFilter</code> will be checked first.

<p>
Second, there are some special filter configuration directives aimed at those
FTP commands that cause changes to files and directories on the server system: <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_PathAllowFilter.html"><code>PathAllowFilter</code></a> and <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_PathDenyFilter.html"><code>PathDenyFilter</code></a>.  Like <code>AllowFilter</code> and <code>DenyFilter</code>, the
<code>Allow</code> filter, if present, is checked first, then a
<code>DenyFilter</code>, if present.  <code>PathAllowFilter</code> and
<code>PathDenyFilter</code> are checked <i>after</i> the
<code>AllowFilter</code> and <code>DenyFilter</code> directives.  These
<code>Path</code> filters are only applied to the following FTP commands:
<code>DELE</code>, <code>MKD/XMKD</code>, <code>RMD/XRMD</code>,
<code>RNFR</code>, <code>RNTO</code>, <code>STOR</code>, <code>STOU</code>,
and to the <code>SITE</code> commands <code>CHGRP</code> and <code>CHMOD</code>.
Note that using both <code>PathAllowFilter</code> and
<code>PathDenyFilter</code> at the same time is not a good idea; only one
filter is generally needed.

<p>
One property that often catches the unwary administrator is the fact that
<code>proftpd</code> only operates on the first <code>Filter</code> directive
defined in the configuration file; it does not cycle through multiple
<code>Filter</code> directives.  This is because multiple regular expressions
can be combined into a single (albeit more complex) regular expression.  The
alternation metacharacter is helpful in creating such combined regular
expressions.  For example, if you had the following in your
<code>proftpd.conf</code>:
<pre>
  PathAllowFilter \.jpg$
  PathAllowFilter \.jpeg$
  PathAllowFilter \.mpeg$
  PathAllowFilter \.mpg$
  PathAllowFilter \.mp3$
</pre>
only the first <code>PathAllowFilter</code> would be enforced.  To enforce
all Filter simultaneously, use:
<pre>
  PathAllowFilter \.(jpg|jpgeg|mpeg|mpg|mp3)$
</pre>
Matches are case-sensitive! Also note that if you surround your regular
expression in quotation (&quot;) marks, any backslash will itself need
to be escaped; ProFTPD's configuration parser interprets backslashes inside
of quoted strings a little differently.  Thus, the example above would look
like this:
<pre>
  PathAllowFilter &quot;\\.(jpg|jpgeg|mpeg|mpg|mp3)$&quot;
</pre>
if using quotation marks.

<p>
Another characteristic to keep in mind is that Filters are only applied to
FTP command <i>parameters</i>, not to the FTP command itself.  Most of the
time, this is not a problem.  It would be useful sometimes, though, to
be able to filter parameters of commands other than those filtered by the
<code>Path</code> filter directives.  It would be an easy change to the
source code; however, there is no feature request for the ability to do this
on <a href="http://bugs.proftpd.org">bugs.proftpd.org</a> with a good
justification for such a feature.  If you can think of one, please open
such a request.

<p>
When developing your Filter directives, it often helps to keep an eye on the
server <a href="Debugging.html">debugging</a> output, to see how well your
filters are being applied.
