"""Restricted Python transformation examples

This module contains pairs of functions. Each pair has a before and an
after function.  The after function shows the source code equivalent
of the before function after it has been modified by the restricted
compiler.

These examples are actually used in the testRestrictions.py
checkBeforeAndAfter() unit tests, which verifies that the restricted compiler
actually produces the same output as would be output by the normal compiler
for the after function.

# makes the elements of two_element_sequence visible to f via its 'a' and
# 'b' arguments, and the dict_with_key_c['c'] value visible via its 'c'
# argument.  That is, it's a devious way to extract values without going
