# __import__
# apply
# dict
# enumerate
# filter
# getattr
# hasattr
# iter
# list
# map
# max
# min
# sum
# all
# any

# Builtins that are intentionally disabled
# compile   - don't let them produce new code
# dir       - a general purpose introspector, probably hard to wrap
# execfile  - no direct I/O
# file      - no direct I/O
# globals   - uncontrolled namespace access
# input     - no direct I/O
# locals    - uncontrolled namespace access
# open      - no direct I/O
# raw_input - no direct I/O
# vars      - uncontrolled namespace access

# There are several strings that describe Python.  I think there's no
# point to including these, although they are obviously safe:
# copyright, credits, exit, help, license, quit

# Not provided anywhere.  Do something about these?  Several are
# related to new-style classes, which we are too scared of to support
# <0.3 wink>.  coerce, buffer, and reload are esoteric enough that no
# one should care.

# buffer
# classmethod
# coerce
# eval
# intern
# object
# property
# reload
# slice
# staticmethod
# super
# type
