# PAP module to authenticate users based on their stored password
#
#  Supports multiple encryption/hash schemes.
#
#  The "auto_header" configuration item can be set to "yes".
#  In this case, the module will look inside of the User-Password
#  attribute for the headers {crypt}, {clear}, etc., and will
#  automatically create the attribute on the right-hand side,
#  with the correct value.  It will also automatically handle
#  Base-64 encoded data, hex strings, and binary data.
#
#  For instructions on creating the various types of passwords, see:
#
#  http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/347.html
