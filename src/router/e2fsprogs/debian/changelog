        999,999,999 in its progress display.
  * tune2fs will not allow the user from setting a ridiculous number of
        reserved blocks which would cause e2fsck to assume the superblock
        was corrupt.  E2fsck's standards for what is a ridiculous number
        of reserved blocks has also been relaxed to 50% of the blocks in
        the filesystem.
  * The blkid library will return vfat in preference to msdos, and ext3 in
        preference to ext2 (if the journalling flag is set) so that mount
        will do the right thing.  (Closes: #287455)
  * The fsck program will now accept an optional filedescriptor argument
        to the -C option.
  * Mke2fs will now use the -E option for extended options; the old -R
        (raid options) option is still accepted for backwards compatibility.
  * Fix a double-free problem in resize2fs.  (Red Hat Bugzilla #132707)
  * Mke2fs will now accept a size in megabytes or gigabytes (via "32m" or
        "4g" on the command line) if the user finds this more convenient
        than specifying a block count.
  * Fix an obscure, hard-to find bug in "e2fsck -S" caused by an inode
        cache conherency problem.
  * Debugfs now supports a new command, set_inode_field, which allows a
        user to manually set a specific inode field more conveniently, as
        well as set entries in the indirect block map.
  * Debugfs's set_super_value command has been enhanced so that the user
        can set most superblock fields, including the date/time fields and
        some of the more newsly added superblock fields.
  * E2fsprogs programs now accept an offset to be passed to the file
        specifiers, via the syntax: "/tmp/test.img?offset=1024"
  * E2fsprogs will now accept blocksizes up to 65536; kernel support on
        the x86 doesn't exist, but it is useful on other architectures.
  * Fix bug in debugfs where kill_file would lead to errors when deleting
        devices and symlinks.  (Sourceforge Bugs #954741 and #957244)
  * Fix bug in the blkid library when detecting the ocfs1 filesystem 
  * Updated Italian translation file
  * E2fsck will now recover from a journal containing illegal blocks.

    few potential hangs, and eliminated a file descriptor leak.
  * E2fsck now updates the global free block and inode counters from
    the block group specific counters quietly.  This is needed for an
    experimental kernel patch which improves SMP scalability by not 
    locking the entire filesystem during block or inode allocation; if

  ** Fixes for data-corruption bugs not reported to the BTS: e2fsck
    trashed external journals needing to be replayed, e2fsck now hides
    visible journal files (data corruption problems when not excluded from
    a backup and then restored) (Closes: #132654).
  ** Other noticable bugs fixed include: e2fsck null pointer
    dereferencing, fsck did not finds LVM volumes by UUID or by label,
    largefile support (ie. dealing with filesystems inside 2GB+ files) was
    broken in several programs.
  * Switch to debhelper v3 to get ldconfig automatically handled
    (lintian reported that it was broken).  Now call dh_makeshlibs, but
    still override its generated shlibs file with ours, to get compiled
    packages depend of the correct virtual packages, which include
    full sonames.
  * Removed call do dh_installman (Closes: #115526).
  * Cleaned up maintainer scripts with dead code - most things are now
    more properly handled by debhelper.  Removed an "exit 0" lurking in
    preinst - can't find a reason for it in the changelog, it was probably
    here for ages.
  * Remove obsolete maint-scripts in binary-arch, as they are provided by
    upstream.
  * Also remove upstream-shipped config.cache before configuring.  That
    shouldn't impact us, but well, that makes lintian happy :)

  * Converted to debstd - let it do the stripping stuff.
  * Separated libcomerr into a standalone lib - includes full doc and tools.
  * Separated development files into e2fslibs-dev, which Provides the 4 other
    -dev packages.
  * Now Provides the 4 other lib packages, to make it possible not to depend
    upon e2fsprogs itself. These libs WILL be taken out of "progs" in the
    next release.
