Version 0.11 (2015-05-30)
-------------------------
	- implemented 'suboption' configuration tag which allows to set
	  other relay-agent information beside the agent-id.  In detail,
          setting of RFC 3527 link selection and RFC 5107 server identifier
	  is now supported (thanks to Michael Rack for idea and code).

	- fixed possible misalignment problem when calculating the ip
	  checksum

	- massive cleanup of code which handles the relay-agent information.

	  COMPATIBILITY: this can change the generated DHCP requests when
	  relaying non RFC compliant messages (e.g. when multiple 82 relay
	  agent information are present).

	- require a C99 compiler; this allows to cleanup code by using
	  flexible arrays and designated array initializers

	  COMPATIBILITY: this will break build with ancient toolchains but
	  C99 exists now for 16 years already...

	- fixed build with recent glibc

Version 0.10 (2012-04-30)
-------------------------
	- removed duplicate dot in logged timestamp

	- removed compatibility hack which breaks build within recent
	  environments

	- added systemd unit

	- added 'compathack' configuration parameter

	- changed client addressing; responses are sent now to the yiaddr
	  instead of to the ciaddr. Generation of broadcast vs. unicast
	  message more consistent with RFC 2131 now (non-trivial patch
	  provided by Robin Haberkorn).

	  COMPATIBILITY: old behavior can be restored by 'compathack 0'.

Version 0.9 (2010-12-14)
------------------------
	- fixed inconsistencies in the naming of default configuration
	  file; now it is named 'dhcp-fwd.conf' everywhere. Previously,
	  'dhcp-fwd.cfg' was used at some places

	- set SO_REUSEADDR option for client sockets; this allows
	  dhcp-forwarder and another dhcp server to run simultaneously
	  on the same host (patch provided by Stefan Keller)

Version 0.8 (2008-12-30)
--------------------------
	- relicensed to GPLv3
	- implemented $VAR expansion in configuration file
	- moved to git
	- fixed build on big-endian systems
	- implemented better support for upstart init system by raising
	  SIGSTOP signal after initialization
	- added 'ports' configuration option to specify client/server
	  ports to be used on the specified interface
	- support loopback interfaces

Version 0.7 (2004-08-19)
------------------------
	- fixed compilation with dietlibc 0.27

Version 0.6 (2004-06-17)
------------------------
	- allowed to bind sender-side sockets to one interface only; this
	  should allow to run multiple instances of dhcp-forwarder. To
	  enable this feature, an additional parameter was added to the
	  'server ip ...' option

Version 0.5 (2003-07-15)
------------------------
	- minor cleanups in the spec-file
	- allowed '.' in interface names to make it work with VLAN kernels

Version 0.4 (2002-08-29)
------------------------
	- remove agent-id in BOOTREPLYs instead of padding it; WinNT seems
	  to misinterpret it
	- non-ethernet interfaces on server-side are allowed now; thanks to
	  Michal Pokrywka for reporting this
	- minor enhancements in the initscript
	- controlling-terminal will be now closed after forking; thanks to
	  Michal Pokrywka for reporting the problem and giving the proper
	  solution
	- minor code cleanups
	- it _should_ compile with uClibc now
	- FIX: fixed improper usage of alloca() which caused burning
	  computers and crashing satellites when not enabling inlining
	  (reported by Michal Pokrywka)
	- fixed 'condrestart' command of the initscript

Version 0.3 (2002-07-12)
------------------------
	- Minor enhancements in the build-system (generalized sed-subst
	  rule)
	- FIX: closing cfg-files after parsing now
	- closing unneeded fd 0 before forking
	- FIX: remove agent-id accordingly RFC 3046 when relaying
	  BOOTREPLY messages
	- 'make splint' finishes checking without warnings now (requires
	  recent CVS version of splint)
	- minor cross-compilation fixes
	- minor fixes to compile with CVS version of dietlibc
	- added option to set specific 'giaddr'; see man-page for
	  instructions
	- added sample configurations to README
	- resource-limits will be used now (after killing remotely a 10km
	  away located router by memory-overcommiting I felt this a good
	  idea)
	- improved logging
	- compiles with egcs-1.1.2 and glibc-2.1.3 now
	- added whitebox-testsuite for some error-prone functions
	- made resource-limits configurabely
	- splint succeeds now with '-strict' settings
	- minor fixes and extensions in the configfile parser
	- SECFIX: drop supplemental groups also
	- awakened the logfile-functionality to life
	- changed default username from dhcpfwd to dhcp-fwd; using three
	  different names (dhcp-forwarder, dhcp-fwd and dhcpfwd) in one
	  small project is a little bit too confusing...

Version 0.2 (2002-06-14)
------------------------
	- Small fixes in the build-system (WWW distribution rules,
	  requirements for automake 1.6
	- Fixed broken '--disable-dietlibc' and enhanced this option
	- Added doc
	- Added man-page


Version 0.1 (2002-06-13)
------------------------
	- initial release
