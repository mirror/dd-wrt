.SH "NAME"
upscmd \- UPS administration program for instant commands
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBupscmd\fR \-h
.sp
\fBupscmd\fR \-l \fIups\fR
.sp
\fBupscmd\fR [\-u \fIusername\fR] [\-p \fIpassword\fR] [\-w] [\-t <timeout>] \fIups\fR \fIcommand\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBupscmd\fR allows you to invoke "instant commands" in your UPS hardware\&. Not all hardware supports this, so check the list with \-l to see if anything will work on your equipment\&.
.sp
On hardware that supports it, you can use this program to start and stop battery tests, invoke a front panel test (beep!), turn the load on or off, and more\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-h\fR
.RS 4
Display the help message\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l\fR \fIups\fR
.RS 4
Show the list of supported instant commands on that UPS\&. Some hardware may not support any of them\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-u\fR \fIusername\fR
.RS 4
Set the username for the connection to the server\&. This is optional, and you will be prompted for this when invoking a command if \-u is not used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR \fIpassword\fR
.RS 4
Set the password to authenticate to the server\&. This is also optional like \-u, and you will be prompted for it if necessary\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-w\fR
.RS 4
Wait for the completion of command execution by the driver and return its actual result from the device\&. Note that this feature requires that both upsd and the driver support TRACKING (NUT version 2\&.8\&.0 or higher) or it will otherwise fail\&. The command will also block until an actual result is provided from the driver, or the timeout is reached (see
\fB\-t\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR \fIseconds\fR
.RS 4
Set a timeout when using
\fB\-w\fR\&. Defaults to 10 seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIups\fR
.RS 4
Connect to this UPS\&. The format is
upsname[@hostname[:port]]\&. The default hostname is "localhost"\&.
.RE
.SH "UNATTENDED MODE"
.sp
If you run this program inside a shell script or similar to invoke a command, you will need to specify all of the information on the command line\&. This means using \-u and \-p\&. Otherwise it will put up a prompt and your program will hang\&.
.sp
This is not necessary when displaying the list, as the username and password are not required for read\-only mode\&.
.sp
Moreover, if you run this program inside a shell script or similar, you should only consider using output from stdout, not stderr\&.
.SH "DANGEROUS COMMANDS"
.sp
Some drivers like \fBapcsmart\fR(8) have built\-in paranoia for the dangerous commands like load\&.off\&. To make them actually turn off the load, you will have to send the command twice within a short window\&. That is, you will have to send it once, then send it again after 3 seconds elapse but before 15 seconds pass\&.
.sp
This paranoia is entirely defined within the driver\&. upsd and upscmd have no control over the timing\&.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.sp
upscmd won\(cqt work unless you provide a valid username and password\&. If you get "access denied" errors, make sure that your \fBupsd.users\fR(5) has an entry for you, and that the username you are using has permissions to SET variables\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
There is currently no way to tell the user when the driver requires confirmation to invoke a command such as load\&.off\&.
.sp
This is on the list of things to fix in the future, so don\(cqt despair\&. It involves magic cookies\&.
