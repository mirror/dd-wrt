This man page only documents the hardware\-specific features of the bestups driver\&. For information about the core driver, see \fBnutupsdrv\fR(8)\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.SH "NOTE"
.sp
Please note that this driver is deprecated and will not receive new development\&. If it works for managing your devices \(em fine, but if you are running it to try setting up a new device, please consider the newer \fBnutdrv_qx\fR(8) instead, which should handle all \fIQ*\fR protocol variants for NUT\&.
.sp
If your device works with this driver, but does not work with \fBnutdrv_qx\fR(8), please report this via the mailing list or issue tracker\&.
.SH "SUPPORTED HARDWARE"
.sp
\fBbestups\fR was designed to monitor Best Power UPS hardware like the Fortress, Fortress Telecom, Axxium Rackmount and Patriot Pro\&. It also recognizes and supports SOLA units such as the 325, 520 and 620\&. In addition, the Best 610 is supported using the \(oqID\(cq option\&.
.sp
Other UPS hardware using the Phoenixtec protocol should also work, but they will generate a warning since their battery information is not known\&.
.sp
This driver does not support some older Best/SOLA units\&. (For older Fortress units, see \fBbestfortress\fR(8)\&.)
.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"
.sp
This driver supports the following optional settings in the \fBups.conf\fR(5):
.PP
\fBnombattvolt=\fR\fInum\fR
.RS 4
Override the battery float voltage which is normally determined by asking the hardware\&. This is useful if your UPS constantly reports
battery\&.charge
values just below 100% even when it\(cqs completely charged\&.
.sp
If you have this problem, set this to whatever
battery\&.voltage
reports when the UPS is known to be completely charged with a good battery\&.
.sp
The author\(cqs Best Fortress 750 uses
nombattvolt=27\&.4\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBbattvoltmult=\fR\fInum\fR
.RS 4
Multiply the reported battery voltage by this number\&. Some devices report only a fraction of the total battery voltage\&.
.sp
For example, the SOLA 610 700VA UPS (with a 24V battery) reports the single cell voltage (about 2\&.27V when fully charged)\&. In this particular case you can set
battvoltmult = 12
in
\fBups.conf\fR(8)
to fix this\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBID=\fR\fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Set the Identification response string\&. This should only be used with hardware that supports the Phoenixtec protocol status inquiry commands, but not the "ID" command, such as the Best/SOLA 610\&. Format of the ID string is: AAA,BBBB,CCC,DDD,EE\&.E,FF\&.F
.sp
AAA is the three\-character identification for the UPS model\&.
.sp
BBBB is the output power in VA (volt amperes)\&. B is an integer number ranging from 0 to 9\&.
.sp
CCC is the Nominal Input Voltage\&. C is an integer number ranging from 0 to 9\&. The unit is Volts AC\&.
.sp
DDD is the Nominal Output Voltage\&. D is an integer number ranging from 0 to 9\&. The unit is Volts AC\&.
.sp
EE\&.E is the Battery Voltage that will cause the UPS to shut itself off\&. E is an integer number ranging from 0 to 9\&. Then unit is Volts DC and a decimal point is present\&.
.sp
FF\&.F or FFF\&.F is the Battery Voltage at full charge\&. F is an integer number ranging from 0 to 9\&. Then unit is Volts DC\&. Typically, for 700VA, 1KVA and 1\&.5KVA units, the format is FF\&.F\&. For 2KVA and 3KVA units, the format is FFF\&.F\&.
.sp
Example: a Best 610 1\&.5KVA unit would use the string "610,1500,120,120,10\&.0,48\&.0"\&.
.RE
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
The battery charge percentage value (in battery\&.charge) is derived from the voltage data that the UPS returns, since the UPS doesn\(cqt return that value directly\&. On some hardware, the charge will remain at 100% for a long time and then drops quickly shortly before the battery runs out\&. You can confirm from the battery\&.voltage readings that this is a problem with the UPS and not this driver\&.
.sp
Similarly, the float from the charger in some models forces the battery charge percentage back up to 100% immediately after the UPS goes back on\-line, so you can\(cqt tell when it is really recharged\&.
.sp
Finally, some models give one value for the battery\(cqs nominal voltage and yet actually have a nominal voltage slightly below that\&. This leads to things such as the perpetual 98\&.7% charge on the author\(cqs Fortress 750, even when it\(cqs been charging for weeks\&. You can use nombattvolt= in \fBups.conf\fR(8) to fix this\&.
