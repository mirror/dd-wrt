This man page only documents the specific features of the nutdrv_atcl_usb driver\&. For information about the core driver, see \fBnutupsdrv\fR(8)\&.

.SH "SUPPORTED HARDWARE"
.sp
This driver is for UPS hardware which identifies itself as USB idVendor 0001 and idProduct 0000, and iManufacturer ATCL FOR UPS\&. Known manufacturers include Kanji and Plexus\&.
.sp
The UPS interface seems to be a generic USB\-to\-serial chip, and for hardware manufactured by Kanji and Plexus, the microcontroller appears to emulate a traditional contact\-closure interface\&. This translates into only three states in ups\&.status: \fBOL\fR, \fBOB\fR and \fBOB LB\fR (similar to \fBgenericups\fR(8)), with no other dynamic status values reported\&.
.sp
Note that these USB identifiers (including the iManufacturer string) have also been seen on devices that are supported by the fuji subdriver of \fBnutdrv_qx\fR(8)\&.
.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"
.sp
This driver supports the following optional setting:
.PP
\fBvendor =\fR \fIname\fR
.RS 4
In case your iManufacturer (Vendor) string does not exactly match
ATCL FOR UPS, you may provide an alternate string here (or specify "NULL" if the device does not provide a vendor string but you want this driver to match)\&.
.sp
Note that a more likely case for mismatch is that your device is handled by another driver for
0001:0000
devices, such as
\fBnutdrv_qx\fR(8)\&.

This driver does not intend to support USB\-matching settings common to other drivers, such as
\fBvendorid\fR,
\fBproduct\fR,
\fBproductid\fR,
\fBserial\fR,
\fBdevice\fR
or
\fBbus\fR; also the
\fBvendor\fR
setting supported here is not a regular expression\&.

.SH "BUGS"
.sp
The UPS returns the same code for "load power is off" as for "on line power"\&. This condition will not be observed if the NUT upsmon in primary mode runs on the box powered by the UPS, but may be an issue if the UPS is monitored by a remote (secondary) system\&.
.sp
The time between the shutdown command and removal of power seems to be fixed at 30 seconds\&. Ensure that the NUT shutdown script is invoked as late as possible in the shutdown procedure (in case some services take longer than others to clean up)\&.
.sp
Most contact\-closure UPSes will not power down the load if the line power is present\&. This can create a race when using secondary \fBupsmon\fR(8) systems\&. See the \fBupsmon\fR(8) man page for more information\&. The solution to this problem is to upgrade to a smart protocol UPS of some kind that allows detection and proper load cycling on command\&.
