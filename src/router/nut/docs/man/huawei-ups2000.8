The UPS2000 series has two variants: UPS2000\-A with a tower chassis, and UPS2000\-G with a rack\-mount chassis\&. Within these two variants, there are also two sub\-variants: a standard runtime model powered by an internal battery pack denoted by an "S" suffix, and a long runtime model powered by an external battery pack denoted by an "L" suffix\&.
.sp
All of these models should be equally supported, but more testers are needed\&. Currently, it has been tested on the following models\&.

If your model is not in the list, we encourage you to report successful or unsuccessful results to the bug tracker or the mailing list\&. Make sure to include the full model number of your UPS manually in your report, because many units only report themselves as "UPS2000\-A" regardless of their models, including the G series\&.
.sp
As of 2022, there is also a new hardware variant with a WCH CH341 USB\-to\-serial chip instead of a MaxLinear/Exar RX21V1410 chip and reports itself as "UPS2000G"\&. Driver support has been added since v0\&.03\&.
.sp
huawei\-ups2000 uses the libmodbus project, for Modbus implementation\&.
.SH "CABLING"
.sp
The UPS has a USB port and a RS\-232 port\&. Both are supported, but on most UPS models, USB is only usable on Linux 5\&.12 and later, via the \fBxr_serial\fR kernel module\&. But for the newer hardware variant with a WCH CH341 chip, it should have better compatibility via the \fBch341\fR kernel module\&. See subsection \fBUSB\fR for details\&. On the other hand, RS\-232 is always supported on all operating systems\&.
.sp
Only one port can be used at a time\&. When USB is used, RS\-232 should be unplugged from the UPS, and vice versa\&. Further, optional adapter cards, such as RS\-485 or SNMP, are not supported\&. They should be removed from the UPS\&.
.sp
Because the UPS port can be unresponsive under certain circumstances, it\(cqs recommended to power cycle your UPS after making a cabling change, especially after changing the port type\&. That is, turn off the UPS power output via the front panel, then unplug the UPS from line power input\&. Wait for the LCD screen to go black\&. Finally reconnect line power and restart your UPS\&.
.SS "USB"
.sp
The USB port on the UPS2000 is originally powered by a MaxLinear/Exar RX21V1410 USB\-to\-serial converter chip, it\(cqs only supported by Linux 5\&.12 or newer, via the \fBxr_serial\fR kernel module\&. Its \fBlsusb\fR report is:
.sp

.RS 4

.nf

.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
However, a recent hardware variant switched to the WCH CH341 serial chip:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If your unit has a WCH CH341 chip (likely only found in units made after 2022), when the UPS2000 is connected via USB, you should see the following logs in \fBdmesg\fR\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If so, you should be able to proceed without worrying about kernel compatibility\&. This CH341 chip has been around for a decade and should be compatible with your system\&.
.sp
On the other hand, if your unit has a MaxLinear/Exar XR21V1410 chip, like most users do, when the UPS2000 is connected via USB to a supported Linux system, you should see the following logs in \fBdmesg\fR\&.
.sp
.if n \{\

On an unsupported system, the XR21V1410 USB device can still be recognized as a USB ACM device, but communication is impossible, please don\(cqt waste your time on \fBcdc_acm\fR\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.sp
If you\(cqre already running on Linux 5\&.12 or newer kernels, but still cannot see the \fBxr_serial\fR driver, it means the driver is not enabled in your kernel build\&. If you\(cqre a regular user, you should file a bug report to your Linux distro maintainers and ask them to enable \fBxr_serial\fR (kernel option CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_XR)\&.
.sp
When upgrading the Linux kernel isn\(cqt an option, or when you are using another operating system (e\&.g\&. FreeBSD), RS\-232 must be used\&. Even for CH341 users, one can try this option if USB somehow refuses to work\&.
.SS "RS\-232"
.sp
RS\-232 is supported on all operating systems, either via a built\-in serial port on your computer, or by using an external USB\-to\-RS\-232 converter\&. If you plan to use an USB\-to\-RS\-232 converter, make sure it\(cqs supported by your operating system\&.
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.sp
This driver is not built by default\&. You can build it by installing libmodbus (with development packages) and running
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
configure \-\-with\-serial=yes \-\-with\-modbus=yes
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
You also need to give proper (R/W) permissions on the local serial device file to allow the NUT driver run\-time user to access it\&. This may need additional setup for start\-up scripting, udev or upower rules, to apply the rights on every boot \(em especially if your device nodes are tracked by a virtual filesystem\&.
.sp
For example, a USB\-to\-serial converter can be identified as /dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux, or /dev/ttyU0 on FreeBSD (note the capital "U")\&. A built\-in serial port can be identified as /dev/ttyS0 on Linux or one of /dev/cua* names on FreeBSD\&.
.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"

This driver supports the following optional settings in the \fBups.conf\fR(5) file:
.PP
\fBoffdelay=\fR\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Time to wait before shutting down the UPS (seconds), acceptable range is 6 seconds (0\&.1 minutes) to 5940 seconds (99 minutes)\&. Defaults to 60 seconds\&. Must be a multiple of 6 seconds\&.

.PP
\fBrebootdelay=\fR\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4

instant command\&. If you\(cqve adjusted
\fBoffdelay\fR, you should also adjust
\fBrebootdelay\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBondelay=\fR\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Time to wait before switching on the UPS (seconds), acceptable range is 60 seconds (1 minutes) to 5940 seconds (99 minutes)\&. Defaults to 60 seconds\&. Must be a multiple of 60 seconds (not 6 seconds)\&. You don\(cqt need to adjust this delay unless you have special requirements\&.

Normally, the load is turned on as soon as line power is back\&. But if line power is never lost, or has came back unexpectedly in the middle of an ongoing shutdown (an undesirable "power race" condition that many entry\-level products on the market fail to recover from), the load is turned on after an \fBondelay\fR\&. Thus, UPS2000 is unaffected by a power race, the load is guaranteed to always restart\&.

The driver has a basic foolproof mechanism\&. If the bypass input is already abnormal due to a power failure, the driver refuses to enter bypass mode by aborting the command and logging an error\&.

Under certain circumstances, some registers can return invalid values and trigger a "data stale" error\&. Once a data stale error has occurred, you should see error messages similar to the example below in the system log\&.

.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
So far all known problems have been fixed by the author, but an unknown one cannot be ruled out\&. If you have encountered "data stale" problems during normal uses, please file a bug report with full logs attached\&.
.sp
Before troubleshooting or reporting a problem, it\(cqs important to check your \fBdmesg\fR log for USB connect and disconnect events to avoid wasting time on the NUT driver when the actual problem is USB\&. For example, if someone yanks the cable out of the USB port, or if a new USB device is plugged into a USB host/hub that is struggling to power its ports (common on single\-board computers like Raspberry Pi), or if you have flaky cabling or EMI noise, the serial converter can get disconnected from USB, at least briefly\&. This creates a permanent data stale, the driver must be restarted (plugging the USB back won\(cqt fix it, since the driver is still using the nonexistent serial device)\&. These USB problems usually have nothing to do with NUT\&. If it\(cqs the case, you should solve the underlying USB problem \- check the cable, check the converter, try a powered USB hub, try a full\-speed USB isolator, etc\&.
.SS "Serial port becomes unresponsive"
.sp
Some malformed commands are known to lock up the serial port (including USB, which is a USB\-to\-serial device)\&. Upon receiving them, UPS2000 stops all serial communications\&. The result is a completely unresponsive UPS, regardless of what you do \- restarting NUT, rebooting the computer \- cannot restore connectivity, as if someone has unplugged the RS\-232 cable\&. To recover, simply power cycle the UPS: Turn off the UPS output via the front panel, then unplug the UPS from line power\&. Wait for the LCD front screen to go black\&. Finally reconnect line power and restart your UPS\&.
.sp
That being said, a serial port lockup is unlikely to happen\&. To our best knowledge, this driver never sends malformed commands to the UPS (it was only a problem during early development)\&. Furthermore, due to a CRC checksum, they\(cqre unlikely to be accidentally generated\&.
.sp
Still, we recommend to power cycle your UPS after making a cabling change, especially after changing from RS\-485/USB to RS\-232, just to ensure the UPS selects the correct communication interface\&. Also, if you have discovered a reproducible serial port lockup problem, it can be an previously unknown bug, make sure to file a bug report\&.
.SS "USB chip (MaxLinear/Exar RX21V1410) is unsupported"
.sp
As previously stated, only RS\-232 is supported on all systems\&. On most UPS units, the USB chip RX21V1410 is used, and it requires a device\-specific driver \fBxr_serial\fR, which is only available on Linux 5\&.12 and newer kernels\&.
.sp
On an unsupported system, the USB device can still be recognized as a USB ACM device, but in reality, communication is impossible\&. It can only be fixed by implementing a driver for your system, nothing can be done within NUT\&. Please use the RS\-232 port instead\&.
.sp
Alternatively, if your unit has a WCH CH341 chip (likely only found in units made after 2022), it should have better compatibility\&.
.sp
See the previous section \fBCabling\fR for more information\&.
.sp
Finally, in the unlike scenario that you are using NUT on Microsoft Windows, you should be able to install the USB device driver following the steps in the Huawei UPS2000 (1 kVA\-3 kVA) Modbus Protocol Development Guide\&.
