apc_modbus \- Driver for APC Smart\-UPS Modbus protocol

.SH "SUPPORTED HARDWARE"
.sp
Generally this driver should work for all the APC Modbus UPS devices\&. Some devices might expose more than is currently supported, like multiple phases\&. A general rule of thumb is that APC devices (or firmware versions) released after 2010 are more likely to support Modbus than the USB HID standard\&.

This driver was tested with Serial, TCP and USB interfaces for Modbus\&. Notably, the Serial ports are not available on all devices nowadays; the TCP support may require a purchase of an additional network management card; and the USB support \fBcurrently\fR requires a non\-standard build of libmodbus (pull request against the upstream library is pending, as of at the time of this publication) as a pre\-requisite to building NUT with this part of the support\&. For more details (including how to build the custom library and NUT with it) please see NUT PR #2063

As currently published, this driver supports reading information from the UPS\&. Implementation of support to write (set modifiable variables or send commands) is expected with a later release\&. This can impact the host shutdown routines in particular (no ability to actively tell the UPS to power off or cycle in the end)\&. As a workaround, you can try integrating apctest (from the "apcupsd" project) with a "Test to kill power" into your late\-shutdown procedure, if needed\&.

This driver also supports the following optional settings:

\fBport =\fR \fIstring\fR

Some
\fIvalue\fR
must be set, typically
\fBauto\fR\&.

This could be a device filesystem path like
/dev/usb/hiddev0
but current use of libusb API precludes knowing and matching by such identifiers\&. They may also be inherently unreliable (dependent on re\-plugging and enumeration order)\&. At this time the actual
\fIvalue\fR
is ignored, but syntactically some
\fIport\fR
configuration must still be there\&.

It is possible to control multiple UPS units simultaneously by running several instances of this driver, provided they can be uniquely distinguished by setting some combination of the \fBvendor\fR, \fBproduct\fR, \fBvendorid\fR, \fBproductid\fR, \fBserial\fR, \fBbus\fR and/or \fBdevice\fR options detailed below\&. For devices or operating systems that do not provide sufficient information, the \fBallow_duplicates\fR option can be of use (limited and risky!)

\fBvendorid =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBproductid =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBvendor =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBproduct =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBserial =\fR \fIregex\fR
.RS 4
Select a specific UPS, in case there is more than one connected via USB\&. Each option specifies an extended regular expression (see
\fBregex(7)\fR
for more information on regular expressions), which must match the UPS\(cqs entire respective vendor/product/serial string (minus any surrounding whitespace), or the whole 4\-digit hexadecimal code for
vendorid
and
productid\&.
.sp
Try
\fBlsusb(8)\fR
or running this NUT driver with
\fB\-DD\fR
command\-line argument for finding out the strings to match\&.

\fBbusport =\fR \fIregex\fR
.RS 4
If supported by the hardware, OS and libusb on the particular deployment, this option should allow to specify physical port numbers on an USB hub, rather than logical
device
enumeration values, and in turn \(em this should be less volatile across reboots or re\-plugging\&. The value may be seen in the USB topology output of
lsusb \-tv
on systems with that tool, for example\&.

\fBallow_duplicates\fR
.RS 4
If you have several UPS devices which may not be uniquely identified by the options above (e\&.g\&. only VID:PID can be discovered there), this flag allows each driver instance where it is set to take the first match if available, or proceed to try another\&.
.sp
Normally the driver initialization would abort at this point claiming "Resource busy" or similar error, assuming that the otherwise properly matched device is unique \(em and some other process already handles it\&.

This feature is inherently non\-deterministic! The association of driver instance name to actual device may vary between runs!

If you only care to know that

one of your no\-name UPSes is online, this option can help\&.

\fBwhich\fR
one, it will not!

Force use of specific interface, endpoint, descriptor index etc\&. numbers, rather than defaulting to 0 (rarely other values in certain drivers for some devices known to use non\-zero numbers)\&. Specified as a hexadecimal number\&.

As a rule of thumb for
usb_hid_desc_index
discovery, you can see larger
wDescriptorLength

\fBport\fR=\fIvalue\fR

Depending on the port type you can select a port here\&. For usb only auto is supported, for serial you can pass a device path like /dev/ttyS0 and for tcp you can pass a hostname with optional port like example\&.com:502\&.

.RE
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
This driver relies on advanced features of libmodbus to talk Modbus protocol over USB specifically (Serial and TCP are part of common library codebase)\&. At the time of this writing, the common library project is just expecting a merge of the pull request with this ability\&.
.sp
For the time being, if your OS distribution does not ship the required feature set, you may have to build your own libmodbus and subsequently (re\-)build NUT against this library, as detailed in the NUT GitHub Wiki at https://github\&.com/networkupstools/nut/wiki/APC\-UPS\-with\-Modbus\-protocol

you may need to \(oqmake && sudo make install` if you want to place this library files\(cq variant into a system path (like

conversely, you may want to
\&./configure \-\-with\-libusb \-\-enable\-static \-\-disable\-shared \-\-prefix=/path/to/prefix
and only build and install a static
libmodbus\&.a
(can well be installed into
/tmp
or similarly short\-lived location), so that the customized Modbus+USB logic gets built directly into
apc_modbus
binary program and there would be no potential run\-time conflict with a dynamic library file available elsewhere in the system\&.
