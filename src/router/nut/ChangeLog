	* tests/getexponenttest-belkin-hid.c, drivers/belkin-hid.c: absorb
	  liebert_psi5_line_voltage_fun() into common

	  those which serve this or that HID subtree only. Follows up from PR
	  #2369

2024-03-25  Jim Klimov <jimklimov+nut@gmail.com>

	* drivers/belkin-hid.c: fix liebert_line_voltage_fun() and friends

	  liebert_config_voltage_fun() at the moment as have no non-integer

	  getexponenttest-belkin-hid  Suffices that we #include it in the
	  test source, and drivers/ are among include dirs
	* tests/.gitignore, tests/Makefile.am, tests/driver-stub-usb.c,
	  tests/{getexponenttest.c => getexponenttest-belkin-hid.c}: tests:
	  rename getexponenttest => getexponenttest-belkin-hid since it

	  an example/blueprint for other drivers' tests.

	  ignore potentially unreachable code in platforms-dependent range
	  checks  Same as 34056dd43261c92e9230e2d18ddf5e8f498d98e9 earlier.

2024-03-21  Jim Klimov <jimklimov+nut@gmail.com>

	* docs/man/apc_modbus.txt, docs/nut.dict: update manpage with
	  instructions for USB-capable builds [#2063]
	* m4/nut_check_libmodbus.m4: make it visible when some libmodbus is

2024-03-18  Jim Klimov <jimklimov+nut@gmail.com>

	* Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix: for autotools-only builds, select by
	  OS_DISTRO (avoide duplicates with OS_FAMILY)
	* Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix: exclude GCC on OpenBSD 6.5 from autotools
	  CI builds  Old compiler that won't hush about warnings, pollutes CI
	  dashboard. Equivalent builds handled by `ci_build.sh` are in quiet
	  mode for the first compilation attempt (usually the only one, if
	  all is OK) so these warnings are just not seen by build-log
	  analysis parser.
	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, docs/Makefile.am,
	  tools/gitlog2changelog.py.in: detect if we should mangle
	  ChangeLog.pdf section titles with non-ASCII contributor names
	* docs/Makefile.am: hint to asciidoc/dblatex to trivialize section
	  names into ASCII themselves  Inspired by
	  http://aerostitch.github.io/misc/asciidoc/asciidoc-title_uft8.html
	  but did not directly help at least for Ubuntu 14.04 worker  NOTE:
	  Fallback suggestion to add
	  --dblatex-opts="--param=latex.encoding=utf8" actually broke the PDF
	  doc builds, not only for ChangeLog.
	* tools/gitlog2changelog.py.in: trivialize author names into plain
	  ASCII  Older asciidoc/a2x/dblatex stack fails with non-ASCII
	  characters in section titles (date and commit author become
	  ChangeLog sections).  Inspired by:  *
	  http://aerostitch.github.io/misc/asciidoc/asciidoc-title_uft8.html

	* Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix: wrap unstashing of sources into their own
	  pipeline sub-stage
	* Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix: fix passing of (multi-token)
	  DISTCHECK_FLAGS to autotools build/test variants
	* Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix: add a section for direct use of autotools
	  (once per platform) in all stable-branch builds  In fallout of PR
	  #2256 we had situations "caused" by tighter integration for NUT CI
	  builds (and developer convenience via ./ci_build.sh) which were not
	  seen on the NUT CI farm but could bite the common approach of
	  `./autogen.sh && ./configure && make` on some (not all) platforms.
	* common/nutstream.cpp: avoid pedantic warning about a const/static
	  variable
	* tools/nutconf/Makefile.am: apply convenience CCACHE exports like
	  for other compiled sources [#2256]

	  be consistent in the same file
	* tools/nut-scanner/Makefile.am: rearrange and deduplicate lines for

2024-02-21  Jim Klimov <jimklimov+nut@gmail.com>

	* docs/Makefile.am: abolish dependency from spellcheck on

	* docs/nut.dict: learn about "wildcard" (singular)
	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/man/Makefile.am: do not "ls" files for

	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/man/Makefile.am: chop non-trivial "srcdir"

2024-02-20  Jim Klimov <jimklimov+nut@gmail.com>

	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/man/Makefile.am: only the paths deal in
	  absolutes!
	* docs/Makefile.am: depend spellcheck on .prep-src-docs too, for
	  completeness
	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/man/Makefile.am: .prep-src-docs: for in-tree

	  document products again
	* .gitignore, docs/Makefile.am, docs/man/Makefile.am:
	  docs/man/Makefile.am, docs/Makefile.am, Makefile.am: use
	  *.txt_prepped (with underscore) for suffix rules
	* docs/man/Makefile.am, docs/Makefile.am: insist on having a
	  "$(builddir)/.prep-src-docs"  ...do not get distracted by one
	  in-tree, if any, when doing out-of-tree builds
	* docs/.gitignore: GitIgnore .prep-src-docs* touch-files
	* .gitignore, Makefile.am, docs/Makefile.am, docs/man/Makefile.am:
	  docs/man/Makefile.am, docs/Makefile.am, Makefile.am: avoid hacky
	  rules to pre-call .prep-src-docs; use hacky touch-files instead
	* Makefile.am: try to be sure to use the job server for docs-related
	  sub-makes  ...when using custom make targets to build specific docs
	  or checks
	* docs/man/Makefile.am: enable the opportunistic suffix rule for
	  build products to depend on .prep-src-docs  Hopefully avoids
	  duplicate parallel runs of the helper where the make implementation
	  would support it (courtesy above standard requirements).
	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/man/Makefile.am: play with VPATH to help
	  prefer PREP_SRC symlinks

	  generate" separately from actually "Generating"

	  target for building out-of-tree
	* docs/Makefile.am: do not make a "NOTE:..." line into a heading
	* Makefile.am: ChangeLog: re-use one from tarball when not building
	  from git
	* Makefile.am: call tools/gitlog2changelog.py in SOURCE dir (where
	  git repo is) and use CHANGELOG_FILE to store the result in BUILD
	  dir
	* Makefile.am: add a shortcut to "make ChangeLog.adoc"; fix formal
	  markup if we "failed to generate the ChangeLog" to produce a sane
	  adoc=>pdf note anyway
	* tools/gitlog2changelog.py.in: allow to use CHANGELOG_FILE="-" for
	  redirect to stdout
	* tools/gitlog2changelog.py.in: allow to customize CHANGELOG_FILE
	* tools/nut-scanner/nutscan-display.c: update comments about
	  last_nutdev_num

	* tests/nutconf_ut.cpp: with fixed ABS_TOP_SRCDIR for WIN32, un-block
	  config file parsing tests
	* configure.ac: The more slashes - the better! One can never fully
	  escape them!
	* .github/workflows/codeql.yml: update to v3  Due to

	* configure.ac: fix up ABS_TOP_SRCDIR/ABS_TOP_BUILDDIR for builds of
	  NUT directly on Windows agents
	* common/nutstream.cpp: NutFile::open(): try to report the filename

	  mingw/msys)
	* common/nutstream.cpp: try more locations for getTmpDirPath(),
	  particularly on WIN32
	* tests/nutstream_ut.cpp: improve chances on parallel CI testing:

	* common/nutstream.cpp: neuter fallback localtime_r(), gmtime_r() on
	  mingw builds
	* configure.ac: fix nut_with_debuginfo*="legacy" to consider flag
	  list snapshots made just after autoconf might have mangled them
	* configure.ac: to not change nut_with_debuginfo* from "no" to
	  "legacy", leave it strictly as caller asked  Recent changes are
	  more careful about the "LEGACY FALLBACK" application. Let users ask
	  for it explicitly though.
	* common/nutstream.cpp: NutFile(anonymous_t): trace the attempted
	  m_tmp_dir and filename (if known) in theexception (so far WIN32
	  code path)

	  conflict with m4 scripts and to maintain similarly to CONFIG_FLAGS

	  the script; only do it if they are not yet set (and do set them if
	  re-entering for an in-place build)
	* configure.ac: add C(XX)FLAGS_ORIG tracing printouts to where we
	  check nut_with_debuginfo

	* configure.ac: avoid needless quoting in AC_MSG_RESULT() printouts

	  properly
	* configure.ac: if we apply nut_with_debuginfo_CXX, avoid separate

	* configure.ac: separate internally nut_with_debuginfo into
	  nut_with_debuginfo_C vs. nut_with_debuginfo_CXX
	* configure.ac, ci_build.sh: introduce --with-debuginfo

	  message
	* ci_build.sh: add "TAKING SHORTCUT" to re-generate if current

2024-02-14  Jim Klimov <jimklimov+nut@gmail.com>

2024-02-13  Jim Klimov <jimklimov+nut@gmail.com>

	* common/nutstream.cpp, common/Makefile.am: augment getTmpDirPath()
	  with NUT altpidpath() support
	* common/nutstream.cpp: drop fflush() for sockets, not applicable
	  type
	* common/nutstream.cpp: refactor getTmpDirPath() with
	  checkExistsWritableDir() helper
	* configure.ac: avoid autoconf-added debug/optimization settings
	* include/nutstream.hpp: make flush() methods in the NutStream
	  classes part of the interface API
	* common/nutstream.cpp, include/nutstream.hpp,
	  tests/nutstream_ut.cpp: introduce flush() methods in the classes;
	  use in NutFile stream tests between write() and read() parts
	  [#2293]  WIN32 builds failed due to lack of flush() and read an
	  empty temporary file. Apparently the OS does not read() from a
	  queued write() buffer/FS cache for a file.
	* common/nutstream.cpp, include/nutstream.hpp: track NutSocket domain
	  and type (e.g. AF_INET and SOCK_STREAM)  Also sanity-check if they
	  fit when used.
	* common/nutstream.cpp: avoid use of hard-coded temporary path; fix
	  WIN32 use-case [#2293]  In WIN32 builds, ::tmpfile() tries to write
	  to C:\ root dir and usually has no permissions to do so. Here we
	  actively probe common envvars for temporary directories (or also
	  use a WIN32 syscall for the effect) to try and get a realistic
	  TMPDIR.  TODO: Consider NUT statepath/(alt)pidpath... maybe not
	  available in tests though. Probe if the chosen dir actually exists?
	* tests/nutstream_ut.cpp: use global "verbose" setting to trace
	  readTestData()/writeTestData() helpers
	* tests/cpputest.cpp, tests/nutstream_ut.cpp: let individual tests
	  see the global "verbose" setting from CLI
	* tests/nutstream_ut.cpp: Revert "tests/nutstream_ut.cpp: let the
	  destructor alone close() the bound socket"  This reverts commit
	  f93c31fa9a5804d8aadbefb0cfb98e0cc03b6e7d.
	* configure.ac: allow to --enable-cppunit=force for dev-testing
	* common/nutstream.cpp: fix NutSocket calls to
	  read/write/close/connect methods to use our WIN32/POSIX friendly
	  wrappers
	* tests/nutstream_ut.cpp: let the destructor alone close() the bound
	  socket
	* tests/nutstream_ut.cpp: getFreePort(): use sock.closex() with
	  exceptions on errors right away

2024-02-12  Jim Klimov <jimklimov+nut@gmail.com>

	* appveyor.yml: try to print "make check" post-mortem details with a
	  subshell  It is surprisingly difficult to do in-line scripts for
	  Windows via YAML
	* configure.ac, tests/Makefile.am: define CPPUNIT_NUT_CXXFLAGS
	  properly
	* configure.ac: if we apply nut_with_debuginfo_CXX, avoid separate
	  settings for CPPUNIT_NUT_CXXFLAGS debugging
	* appveyor.yml: Revert "appveyor.yml: use double-quotes to wrap bash
	  calls (windows shell is quirky with single quotes)"  This reverts
	  commit abf2a9e24e2d122f10c6b74121439f88a43f1d57.
	* tests/nutstream_ut.cpp: on IWN32, use WSAStartup() before socket
	  methods
	* include/nutipc.hpp, tests/nutipc_ut.cpp: accomodate the likes of
	  OSX where sigemptyset() is a macro
	* appveyor.yml: use double-quotes to wrap bash calls (windows shell
	  is quirky with single quotes)
	* ci_build.sh: empty BUILD_TYPE is not an "error", fix the warning
	  message
	* tests/nutipc_ut.cpp: testSignalRecvQuick(): avoid switch/case over
	  an enum  Avoids warning about "enumeration values not explicitly
	  handled in switch: ..."
	* appveyor.yml: print trace files if "make check" failed
	* tests/cpputest.cpp: avoid segfault with debug-trace progress
	  printer and certain compiler optimizations
	* tests/cpputest.cpp: be sure to avoid debug-trace segfaults if
	  "test" is NULL
	* tests/nutstream_ut.cpp: avoid forked helper continuing with another
	  copy of tests
	* configure.ac: separate internally nut_with_debuginfo into
	  nut_with_debuginfo_C vs. nut_with_debuginfo_CXX
	* ci_build.sh: add "TAKING SHORTCUT" to re-generate if current
	  configure script syntax is broken
	* configure.ac, ci_build.sh: introduce --with-debuginfo
	  (BUILD_DEBUGINFO) setting
	* tests/nutipc_ut.cpp: be sure to caught_signals.clear() early in
	  testSignalRecv*()
	* tests/nutipc_ut.cpp, tests/nutconf_ut.cpp: register each test
	  separately to trace them better
	* tests/cpputest.cpp: be sure to flush the printout of starting test
	  name before churning CPU on it
	* tests/nutstream_ut.cpp: try to actively probe an available port
	  number for the test
	* tests/nutipc_ut.cpp: separate tests about received signal count
	  (rapid-fire) and order (staggered)

2024-02-10  Jim Klimov <jimklimov+nut@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: warn early if building with mingw and strict/ansi
	  C/C++ mode
	* drivers/mge-hid.c: fix includes and defines for WIN32 build with
	  strict C89
	* common/common.c: avoid "FOR loop initial declarations" (are only

	* common/nutconf.cpp, include/nutconf.h, tests/Makefile.am,

	  (parseFrom and writeTo methods). Note that the parseFrom
	  implementations are very naive (they simply read whole source
	  stream to memory and call existing parseFromString method).  That's
	  enough for now, however, in future the parsres should directly use
	  NutStream interface.

	* common/nutwriter.cpp, include/nutwriter.h: Special serialiser for

	  the [upsmon]::upsmon directive (which doesn't use the standard =
	  key/ value separator). Also, serialisation of section entry value
	  list was fixed (so that multiple entries are produced rather than a

	* drivers/libusb1.c: Remove unnecessary validation for bus_num  The
	  libusb_get_bus_number() function serves as a simple accessor for
	  the bus number of the opaque device struct. Unlike
	  libusb_get_port_number(), it does not have the ability to convey
	  errors back to the caller, and a bus number of 0 is a valid value.
	  Therefore, any validation around bus_num is redundant.  This commit
	  removes the unnecessary validation code related to bus_num.

	* drivers/apc_modbus.c: apc_modbus: Add target outlet group to load.*
	  and shutdown.* commands  Maybe this is needed, needs to be
	  confirmed.
	* drivers/apc_modbus.c: apc_modbus: Always store times in UTC  This
	  changes `_apc_modbus_date_from_nut` to use `timegm` instead of
	  `mktime` which does not add the current time zone information. This
	  fixes dates that are off-by-one compared to what was set.

2023-11-24  Axel Gembe <axel@gembe.net>

	* configure.ac, include/timehead.h: build: Add a fallback for timegm
	  on Windows / MINGW  MINGW headers do not provide a `timegm`
	  implementation but there is a `_mkgmtime` which does the same:
	  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/mkgmtime-mkgmtime32-mkgmtime64

2023-11-23  Axel Gembe <axel@gembe.net>

	* drivers/apc_modbus.c: apc_modbus: Fix re-read of values at the end
	  of setvar  The for loop searching for the correct register map kept
	  on looping after finding the value which caused the `apc_map`
	  mariable to potentially point to the wrong register map.  This can
	  cause the re-read of the set value at the end of the function to
	  fail.
	* drivers/apc_modbus.c, drivers/apc_modbus.h: apc_modbus: Add
	  ups.test.result  This outputs the test result, the source of the
	  start of the test and a result modifier.

2023-11-16  Jim Klimov <jimklimov@gmail.com>

	* drivers/Makefile.am: dist the apc_modbus.h file

2023-11-14  Axel Gembe <axel@gembe.net>

	* drivers/apc_modbus.c, drivers/apc_modbus.h, drivers/upshandler.h:
	  apc_modbus: Updates, command, writable variables and outlet group
	  support  This adds support for commands, writable variables and
	  outlet groups.  - For commands there is a new table called
	  `apc_modbus_command_map` which defines the supported commands as a
	  tuple of command name, register offset and value to write. This
	  also adds a new instcmd status called
	  `STAT_INSTCMD_CONVERSION_FAILED` for when conversion of values
	  fails. On startup all the commands are registered using
	  `dstate_addcmd`. This also adds support for the `upsdrv_shutdown`
	  function. - For writable variables we added a new flag called
	  `APC_VF_RW` to the existing variables that indicates a writable
	  variable. We added code to convert from a string to UINT/INT/STRING
	  variables with output in APCs register format. There is a new
	  `_apc_modbus_setvar` function that handles setting variables and
	  rereading them from the device. This also adds a new setvar status
	  called `STAT_SET_CONVERSION_FAILED` for when conversion of values
	  fails. Variables are now correctly set as `ST_FLAG_STRING` and
	  `ST_FLAG_RW` and we call `dstate_setaux` to give a maximum length
	  for strings. - For outlet groups, we now have names, configurable
	  delays and commands per outlet group. Devices have an outlet group
	  called MOG (Main outlet group) that switches all the outputs of the
	  UPS and 1-3 SOGs (Switched outlet groups) that can be controlled
	  independently. Note that MOG is `outlet.group.0` and the SOGs start
	  at `outlet.group.1`. The outlet groups should have markings with
	  the same index at the back of the unit. - This also reduces the
	  length of some of the defines to make the variable maps more
	  readable. - It also adds a comment to when the reopen matcher is
	  created that clarifies why we create it.

	* drivers/libhid.c: Fix passing of errors up from libusb 1.x.  The
	  api for get_item_buffered() requires the actual error to be in
	  errno which was automatic for libusb 0.x but libusb 1.x doesn't use
	  errno.  Otherwise a poll-only driver will miss errors like
	  disconnects and never try to reconnect.

	* drivers/libusb0.c, drivers/libusb1.c, drivers/nut_libusb.h,
	  drivers/usb-common.h: Add usb_config_index to
	  usb_communication_subdriver_s, default to 0.  The tactical goal of
	  this change is to change ret = libusb_get_config_descriptor(device,
	  (uint8_t)usb_subdriver.hid_rep_index, &conf_desc); to ret =
	  libusb_get_config_descriptor(device,
	  (uint8_t)usb_subdriver.usb_config_index, &conf_desc);  Before this
	  change, libusb1.c did libusb_get_config_descriptor() with a config
	  index equal to the interface number. For composite devices using an
	  interface index > 0, this is usally the wrong choice. Concretely,
	  I'm using an Arduino for a DIY UPS project and these are composite
	  devices with multiple interfaces under the first (and only) config
	  descriptor.  In the USB descriptor heirarchy, deivce descriptors
	  have config descriptors which have interface descriptors. Also,
	  nearly all USB devices have a single configuration (index 0).  In
	  order to do this, I added a new member alongside the existing
	  hid_rep_idex and hid_desc_index. I chose to do this instead of
	  using the add_var method because this member is used in places in
	  very similar ways to how hid_rep_index and hid_desc_index is used.
	  This new member defaults to 0 which covers the majority of USB
	  devices. Any future subdriver is able to use this if a device
	  requires it. For existing subdrives, we'll just use an index of 0.
	  I also changed some debug logging to print out the config index
	  where the code was already printing the interface index.

	  This adds a new driver called `apc_modbus` to support the APC
	  Modbus protocol over serial ports, TCP connections and USB ports.
	  For USB support to work it needs a [patched `libmodbus` that has
	  support for the APC USB Modbus
	  encapsulation](https://github.com/EchterAgo/libmodbus/commits/rtu_usb).
	  If a `libmodbus` without USB support is detected the driver will
	  build with just the serial and TCP/IP support.

	* drivers/tripplite_usb.c: @jimklimov my apologies please dont kill
	  me for closing the pull request just saw your typo fix on the old
	  one implemented it here.
	* docs/man/tripplite_usb.txt, docs/nut.dict, drivers/tripplite_usb.c:
	  @jimklimov my apologies i royally screwed up the pull request with
	  a rebase. I just started a new to have a clean slate scnario. also
	  added the NUT_UNUSED_VARIABLE  per your recommendation.
	  tripplite_usb.c Added UPS ID (upsid) Support: The code now includes
	  support for matching and uniquely identifying UPS devices using the
	  UPS ID (upsid). The upsid configuration option has been added,
	  which accepts a regular expression to match the UPS ID string. This
	  was done by adding a new function called match_by_unitid, that
	  reads the upsid from the config file, then reads the upsid from the
	  device, and checks if they match. This function is now passed to
	  the comm_driver matcher on first connect and reconnects.  Added the
	  upsid to the upsdrv_makevartable function so it is read and stored
	  from the config file.  tripplite_usb.txt Updated Documentation: The
	  driver documentation was updated to reflect the new functionality.
	  The "EXTRA ARGUMENTS" section now includes information about the
	  upsid configuration option, and how to set it.  thank you to
	  @jimklimov for pointing me in the right direction and hand holding.

	  drivers/nutdrv_qx.c: Add documentation file.  Document various
	  possible transmissions. Might be required to construct testcases

2023-08-14  Jim Klimov <jimklimov+nut@gmail.com>

	* server/upsd.c: setuptcp(): when informing about possible IPv6/IPv4

	  nuances to match current logic; drop GitHub reference [#2013 review

	  * support per PR #2013 discussion  Notably: * move from "would" to
	  "will" verbiage; * specify IPv6 listening first, IPv4 next, as it
	  goes in code; * lean towards trying to listen on two sockets
	  separately always (unless the OS refuses to avoid IPv4-mapped IPv6
	  addressing).

	* drivers/huawei-ups2000.c: huawei-ups2000: fix broken timeout
	  recovery behavior in Issue #1846.  Occasionally, the UPS takes
	  longer than 1 second to respond and finish transmitting a message.
	  This causes a timeout in modbus_read_registers(), and the driver is
	  supposed to retry the request and recover from the failure.
	  Unfortunately, when the driver retries, instead of getting the
	  result of the current request, the leftover bytes from the previous
	  read is received from the serial buffer, creating invalid messages.
	  It causes all following reads to also fail, often with an "Invalid
	  CRC" error, and the driver can never recovery from the failure.
	  This commit fixes the bug by flushing the buffer using function
	  modbus_flush() before invoking modbus_read_registers(). The
	  libmodbus timeout value is also bumped to 2 seconds to avoid
	  unnecessary timeouts and subsequent retries. Finally, the version
	  number is also bumped to reflect the existence of this fix.

2023-01-15  Greg Troxel <gdt@lexort.com>

	* drivers/bestfortress.c: driver/bestfortress: Fix serious shutdown
	  bug and improve shutdown code  - Move setting "ups.shutdown.delay"
	  earlier so that it is available for `upsdrvctl shutdown`.  This
	  results in using that delay, instead of 1s. - Change shutdown delay
	  to 20s from 10s, because that seems more common, and 10s feels too
	  tight. - Add logging about shutdown.  When run with `-k`,
	  `ups.delay.shutdown` has apparently not been initialized.  Fall
	  back to 20, rather than 1, and log better.
	* drivers/bestfortress.c: drivers/bestfortress: Rationalize and
	  improve debugging  - Define a debug logging plan - Add debug log
	  calls - Adjust several existing calls  This commit does not intend
	  to modify behavior other than logging.

	  During USB enumeration, set curDevice->Device. Try to use libusb1's

	* drivers/riello_usb.c: Update riello_usb.c  Added driver setting
	  flag `localcalculation`.  When enabled, driver will calculate
	  values of battery.runtime and battery.load locally. This is for
	  some Riello models (iPlug and iDialog series) that provides
	  incorrect values. Local calculation is done according to nominal
	  battery capacity, nominal battery voltage, actual battery charge,
	  maximum and actual UPS load. Added condition to filter off
	  situation when battery temperature variable is incorrectly set to
	  variable type maximum (255) - which is typical issue of some Riello
	  models (iPlug and iDialog series). If incorrect value is detected
	  temperature is set to 0.

	* NEWS, clients/upslog.c, docs/man/upslog.txt: upslog: Add support
	  for multiple UPSs  upslog is a utility that logs UPS status at
	  regular intervals, specified by the -i option. Unfortunately upslog
	  supports only one UPS. For sites that need to monitor multiple UPSs
	  the options are to cobble an rc script for each or doctor up the
	  nut_upslog.in script to support cloning of the script.
	  Unfortunately an rc script capable of being cloned would become the
	  source of more PRs and would require significanly more tehcnical
	  documentation that by itself might become confusing for the average
	  system administrator.  Therefore a new -m option is added to
	  support multiple UPSs using the same invocation of upslog. The
	  patch parses a -m option, polling each ups listed.

	* drivers/huawei-ups2000.c: huawei-ups2000.c: rename NULL macros,
	  close #1474.  Originally, in the struct array ups2000_cmd[], a
	  REG_NONE macro was used as a short-hand for a nonexistent register
	  value. Unfortunately it was in conflict with a Windows NT macro of
	  the same name (previously not found because it was only tested on
	  Unix systems). Thus, this commit renames it to REG_NULL. To avoid
	  visual confusions with the function pointer field (which also uses
	  C's NULL for its nonexistence), this commit also replaces it with a
	  new macro FUNC_NULL, which is a simple alias to C's NULL.  It's not
	  exactly the best practice, a "UPS2000_" prefix should've been used
	  in principle. However, using it in this case creates exceedingly
	  long lines and makes the struct array definition more difficult to
	  read, which defeats the very purpose of defining these macros to
	  begin with. Considering that it's only an one-off use, it's
	  unlikely to cause further problems.

	* drivers/huawei-ups2000.c: huawei-ups2000.c: ups2000_read_serial():
	  documenting the useless range-check.
	* drivers/huawei-ups2000.c: huawei-ups2000.c: remove useless CRC
	  range check  After crc16() has been modified to accept a size_t
	  length, it's unnecessary to check whether the input length is
	  greater than UINT16_MAX.  Also, the check on whether
	  ident_response_len is at least as long as the
	  IDENT_RESPONSE_CRC_LEN is useless, since this condition is already
	  implied by the previous check in step 2, it's thus removed.
	* drivers/huawei-ups2000.c: huawei-ups2000.c: crc16(): use size_t
	  instead of uint16_t.  This removes the unnecessary casts in
	  between. Also, size_t is semantically more correct than uint16_t.
	* drivers/huawei-ups2000.c: huawei-ups2000.c:
	  ups2000_device_identification(): remove superfluous casts in crc16

	  certainly a bug, but to fix that, only a single cast is needed, not
	  three casts.
	* drivers/huawei-ups2000.c: huawei-ups2000.c: crc16(): remove

	* drivers/huawei-ups2000.c: huawei-ups2000.c: support newer
	  UPS2000G/CH341 variants.  We received a report of the existence of
	  a new hardware variant from the bug tracker [1].  This UPS unit has
	  the model number UPS2000-G-3KRTS just like a model we've previously
	  tested, and it has the same V2R1C1SPC50 firmware, which was tested
	  by us as well (although not on UPS2000-G-3KRTS but on
	  UPS2000-A-2KTTS).  However, there are two obvious hardware
	  differences. First, this unit reports itself as "UPS2000G" via the
	  protocol instead, which is a new value not found in the datasheet
	  or previously encountered by us. Previously, even a "UPS2000G"
	  model reports itself as the "UPS2000A". Another difference is the
	  use of WCH CH341 serial-to-USB converter chip instead of the
	  MaxLinear/Exar RX21V1410 chip.  Bus 002 Device 005: ID 1a86:5523
	  QinHeng Electronics CH341 in serial mode, usb to serial port
	  converter  The production label on the UPS says 2021-12-04. So it's
	  likely a newer hardware revision or variant. Was it redesigned to
	  improve USB serial compatibility? Or my personal guess, due to chip
	  shortage? Who knows.  Nevertheless, once the "UPS2000G" model
	  string is added to the supported list, it was reported that the
	  driver correctly functions without doing anything else. Thus, from
	  a software perspective there's no difference.  Thanks GitHub user
	  @Qinka for reporting it.  [1]

	* scripts/Windows/Makefile.am: Forgot to remove now useless
	  winevent.dll reference
	* configure.ac, scripts/Windows/Makefile.am: Do not use an external

2010-12-20  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* common/wincompat.c, configure.ac, include/common.h: Add usleep()

2010-12-01  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

2010-11-29  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/Makefile.am: Reverting useless previous commit:
	  [[SVN:2705]]

2010-11-26  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/Makefile.am: Add regex library for drivers (by Arnaud
	  Quette)

	  drivers/dstate.c, drivers/dstate.h, drivers/main.c,

	  scripts/Windows}/winevent.mc, scripts/Windows/wininit.c,
	  server/sstate.c, server/upsd.c, server/upstype.h: Change the "full
	  services" approach to a more POSIX one.  We now have only one
	  Windows service in charge of starting/stopping the relevant NUT
	  processes. It's a Windows replacement for the init script.  This
	  service is also a proxy for processes to write to Windows event
	  log. So only one service has to be registered to be able to log
	  event.

2010-11-19  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* clients/upsclient.c: Remove useless header

2010-11-16  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* common/common.c, drivers/main.c: Better use of NUT framework for
	  previous commit
	* common/common.c, drivers/main.c, include/common.h, server/upsd.c:
	  We need to register one driver service per ups in upsd.conf.  So
	  these drivers need to have different names and command line
	  arguments.

2010-11-05  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* common/common.c, drivers/dstate.c, drivers/main.c,

	  library (as in [[SVN:2674]])

2010-11-05  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* configure.ac: This 3 lines has been duplicated instead of being

	* clients/Makefile.am, common/Makefile.am, configure.ac,

	  integration of WinSock library (by Arnaud Quette)

2010-11-04  Arjen de Korte <adkorte-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* configure.ac, drivers/Makefile.am, m4/nut_check_libusb.m4: Checking
	  whether or not we should use the 'regex' library...  ...should be
	  done for all USB connected devices (since we use this in the
	  matcher function). In that case it is much cleaner to add this
	  check in nut_check_libusb.m4. This also fixes the wrong use of
	  AC_SEARCH_LIBS, that already adds '-lregex' to LIBS (which means
	  all binaries are linked against this library).

2022-05-14  Thierry Duvernoy <tduvernoy@free.fr>

	  Quette)

2022-05-13  Jim Klimov <jimklimov@gmail.com>

	* drivers/upsdrvctl.c: if we had to SIGKILL a driver, and succeeded,
	  remove its PID file
	* drivers/main.c: if an old PID file was found, say about it before
	  killing that PID (avoid questionable "kill: No such process" with
	  no further context)
	* .circleci/config.yml: reduce the workload, do not run
	  "default-all-errors" every time (fightwarn-all includes it anyway
	  now)

2022-05-12  Thierry Duvernoy <tduvernoy@free.fr>

	* drivers/usbhid-ups.c: Adding insufficient memory libusb error
	  handling to reconnect UPS instead of doing nothing. For example,
	  this error appears after 1 to 8 hours on an Eaton MGE 1500 UPS
	  (0463:ffff) and causes many "Can't retrieve Report 0a: Resource
	  temporarily unavailable" errors, followed by a passage of UPS in
	  ups.tatus "OL OFF" (Online Off) which immediately cuts off computer

2022-04-08  Jim Klimov <jimklimov+nut@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, docs/nut.dict: NEWS: improve PowerWalker VFI 2000 TGS support

	* drivers/liebert-hid.c, drivers/mge-hid.c: drivers/liebert-hid.c:
	  get PowerWalker VFI 2000 TGS working, read values correctly  This
	  reverts commit c38b45a56a9d1283657d62a9fa1ed1af5daa1ba2 which added
	  such support into mge-hid.c (at risk to proper support of earlier
	  handled devices by various vendors), and transplants the new lines
	  into liebert-hid.c  See issue #560 for a HID walk from the device
	  in question; data like that may help expand liebert-hid.c later
	  (its table seems to map a lot less field names than mge-hid.c, but
	  not sure if "true" Liebert/Phoenixtec HID devices support the
	  rest).

	* drivers/libusb0.c: Cast to unsigned type when interpreting HID
	  descriptor length bytes (libusb 0.1)  The libusb 0.1 interface
	  definition declares a (signed) char type for control messages.  The
	  HID descriptor length contained within a control message is
	  intended to be interpreted as a pair of unsigned bytes so we must
	  cast to uint8_t when doing the arithmetic rather than trip over the
	  sign bit.  Closes #1261, closes #1312.

	  ePDU  Fix a regression that caused a mis-determination of the SNMP

	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: su_setinfo(): fix comment
	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: fix "device.varname" for daisychain 'master'
	  units  * su_setinfo(): should not expose master-specific data (like
	  device.contact coming from IETF un-templated data points not aware
	  about daisy chains) as if it were the data specific to every device
	  in the chain; note that for defaulted data (like device.type="pdu"
	  hardcoded with NULL OID) we still expose it across the board  *
	  su_setOID(): "upsrw ... device.contact" should change the
	  daisychain master device (for IETF un-templated data; but in this
	  commit - always)

	* drivers/apc-hid.c, drivers/cps-hid.c, drivers/hidparser.c,
	  drivers/hidparser.h, drivers/hidtypes.h: Fix incorrect limits for
	  input and config voltages in APC report descriptor  The Back-UPS XS
	  1400U has been observed to report input/config voltage limits that
	  are appropriate for the North American 120V region even though the
	  unit is operating in the European or other 220+V region.  This
	  change diagnoses the the problem by checking if the logical maximum
	  values for UPS.Input.Voltage and UPS.Input.ConfigVoltage are
	  consistent with the UPS.Input.HighVoltageTransfer and if not,
	  increases them.  A similar problem was reported for CPS units in
	  the EU region.  - introduces #defines for all standard usages in
	  power system and battery device pages. - moves cps-hid.c
	  FindReport() to hidparser.c as FindObject_with_ID_Node(). - updates
	  cps-hid.c to account for new defines/function name - adds
	  apc_fix_report_desc() to implement change for APC UPS units

	  checks for the error (loosely) and then applies reasonable values

	  reported rather than be constrained to the limits.

2021-12-19  Scott Colby <scott@scolby.com>

	* drivers/usbhid-ups.c: Add a short sleep between fallback instcmds
	  in usbhid-ups.  For some devices, missing instcmds are emulated by
	  calling two instcmds that do exist in sequence. For some devices,
	  when these commands arrive too quickly, they are not properly
	  processed. (One, both, or neither of the commands are acted upon.)
	  Adding a 1/8th-second delay (125,000 microseconds) between the two
	  instcmds that make up the fallback command has worked to make the
	  TrippLite AVR750U (new version with the 3024 productId/protocol)
	  behave consistently when using the fallback commands
	  (shutdown.return and shutdown.stayoff). This delay is also short
	  enough that it seems unlikely to cause a problem for any devices
	  which don't exhibit this issue.

	  driver

2021-12-15  Nick Briggs <nicholas.h.briggs@gmail.com>

	* drivers/hidparser.c: Move check for LogMax encoding error to
	  parsing of report description  At least one UPS [APC Back-UPS
	  BX1600MI FW:294201G -302201G] is known to have encoding errors in
	  its USB HID report description such that a conforming
	  interpretation of the encoded LogicalMaximum value indicates that
	  it is -1 and the resulting LogicalMin..LogicalMax range is 0..-1.
	  The actual report values read are correctly encoded.  Rather than
	  log a range error each time a value is read we can detect the
	  encoding error when the report description is read (once, at
	  startup) and adjust for the encoding error at that time.

2021-11-22  Yifeng Li <tomli@tomli.me>

	* drivers/huawei-ups2000.c: huawei-ups2000.c: rework logic for
	  "load.on".  Currently the driver prevents the user from executing
	  "load.on" when the UPS is already on, and reports a
	  STAT_INSTCMD_FAILED with error logs. We need to do this if the UPS
	  is in bypass mode, because the UPS would otherwise enter normal
	  mode - "load.on" is not supposed to do that. On the other hand,
	  executing "load.on" when the UPS is already in "normal-mode on" has
	  no effect, it's still a legal command and should not be rejected
	  arbitrarily, which can potentially confuse downstream applications
	  and users.  It also contains two misleading typos in the error
	  logs: (1) it incorrectly suggests "bypass.off" instead of
	  "bypass.stop", and (2) reports "failed: reason unknown." when the
	  reason is simply an already-on UPS.  This commit allows "load.on"
	  to execute when it's in normal mode and already on, and changes the
	  log messages from errors to warnings. Typos in the log messages are
	  also fixed. The "load.on" command is only rejected in bypass mode,
	  with error logs.  Finally, the logic for the off test is reworked
	  to improve readability. The original code checks whether the UPS is
	  on by testing the negative "not OFF" condition, which is not easy
	  to understand - the reader must have intimate knowledge on the code
	  to know its correctness. Namely, When the UPS power status is
	  updated, 1 of the 5 mutually exclusive flags, OL, OB, OL ECO,
	  BYPASS, or OFF is always set, thus the absence of the OFF flag
	  always reliably indicates an ON status. This commits converts the
	  single negative "not OFF" test to three positive tests for "OL",
	  "OB" and "OFF", with additional comments added on reachable and
	  unreachable conditions. Thus, previous uncertainty is eliminated.

	* docs/man/genericups.txt, drivers/genericups.h: genericups: Change

2021-07-06  dogtopus <dogtopus@users.noreply.github.com>

	* docs/man/genericups.txt: docs: Document the special line NULL in

	* drivers/genericups.c: genericups: Bump version number.
	* docs/contact-closure.txt, docs/man/genericups.txt,
	  drivers/genericups.c, drivers/genericups.h: genericups: Add support
	  for FTTx battery backup.  A lot of those "UPSes" use a 4-wire
	  open-drain-like contact closure signaling (dubbed "telemetry
	  interface") to report their status (see
	  https://dl4jz3rbrsfum.cloudfront.net/documents/CyberPower_UM_CBN50U48A-1.pdf
	  for example). They are sorta compatible with APC 940-0020B/C cables
	  in terms of pin assignments, with extra signals for replace battery
	  and battery missing and lack of shutdown signal.  This patch adds a
	  sample device type (23) for this kind of device. It also adds
	  support for the extra signal types (RB for replace battery and
	  BYPASS for disconnected battery) used by these devices, as well as
	  an option to unassign/disable an unused signal in the config file
	  by setting it to NULL.  Note that there is no standard cable for
	  this kind of device, so type 23 assumes RS232 control signaling and
	  RTS as the voltage source for input pin pullups.

	* drivers/eaton-pdu-marlin-mib.c: snmp-ups: fix regression on Eaton
	  ePDU  Fix a regression that caused a mis-determination of the SNMP
	  base OID index (0 or 1, should be 1). This in turn caused a
	  mis-iteration over the outlets, from 0 to N-1 instead of 1 to N,
	  which resulted in the missing Nth outlet (last outlet of the PDU).
	  This also caused some data refresh issues

2021-01-23  Yifeng Li <tomli@tomli.me>

	* drivers/main.c: main.c: write upsdrv_initinfo/updateinfo() logs to
	  syslog  When a NUT driver is started (via upsdrvctl start), it runs
	  the following sequence:  1. Run as a foreground process. 2. Do some
	  basic initialization, log to stderr. 3. If not debugging: - fork()
	  - Run as a daemon, stderr off, syslog on.  The problem, however, is
	  that upsdrv_initinfo() and updateinfo() are first called before
	  forking, as a result, the log messages is only sent to stderr, not
	  syslog. On a traditional init + syslog server setup, those startup
	  messages are lost. However, those lost messages can be urgent - for
	  example, it can be a warning about a failed UPS inverter. If the
	  server is freshly started, the admin may miss them until much
	  later, or keep staring at the mysterious alarm word without finding
	  anything relevant in syslog. Similarly, other types of warnings,
	  such as a rounded ondelay value, should also be visible in syslog.
	  This patch checks the debugging flags and turn on syslog earlier
	  when it's in non-debug, non-fork mode, allowing the logs during
	  upsdrv_initinfo() and upsdrv_updateinfo() to be recorded in syslog.

	* drivers/eaton-pdu-marlin-mib.c: snmp-ups: Restore legacy Eaton ePDU
	  switchability info  Use a hack to also have switchability for both
	  the unit and its outlets on legacy Eaton G2 ePDU   Partially
	  cherry-picked from 42ity fork, and bumped to their faster moving
	  MIB mapping revision number. See
	  https://github.com/42ity/nut/pull/118  As for the behavior of the
	  fix:  * on G2, the first outlet.switchable doesn't exist, so try
	  the 2nd, which is the ugly hack: try on the first outlet to see if
	  switchable  * on G3, the first is good, so flag unique does the
	  rest  Tested on MA G2 and G3.

	* tools/nut-usbinfo.pl: Reindent upower rules header  This piece of
	  the code was really confusing because it looked like, at a glance
	  (and at more than a glance), that the line which we'd have read in
	  the generated rules file was commented out.  Turns out that
	  beginning of lines in the generated rules could be in the middle of
	  the line in the code that generated it. Reindent everything so that
	  each line in the output corresponds to one line in the input,
	  except for empty lines.  There are no differences in output between
	  the versions before and after this change.
	* tools/nut-usbinfo.pl: Simplify exit path  Why "!= usb" when we're
	  already checking for usb and other values above? Always go to the
	  end label if we didn't already jump to the section containing the
	  actual rules.

	  https://lwn.net/Articles/837033/ for an in-depth explanation of how
	  "bind" events should be handled in udev rules.  In short: " The
	  ACTION line causes the entire file to be skipped for anything other
	  than ADD or CHANGE events; in particular, that is what will happen
	  with BIND events. That will cause properties associated with those
	  events to be lost — and the device in question to be set up
	  improperly (if at all). "

	* drivers/solis.c: solis: avoid index out of bounds  Since the
	  parameter taken by autonomy_calc() is used to index a couple of
	  arrays of 5 positions and the variable `im`, which is passed to
	  autonomy_calc(), can be equal to 4, blindly incrementing it by one,
	  when it's 4, leads to an index out of bounds.

	  The number of delimiter characters is no longer hard-coded, but
	  will be detected and thrown away at runtime - Discard any remains
	  in the RX buffer after communication errors - collapse repeating
	  code - upsdrv_shutdown now uses instcmd (removes duplicate code) -

	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: snmp-ups: add ability to set TimeTicks
	  correctly (#687)  * snmp-ups: add ability to set TimeTicks
	  correctly  Driver had been setting read/write parameters as either
	  Integer or String, but OIDs that expect TimeTicks cannot be set
	  using an Integer.  snmp-ups already supported getting TimeTicks
	  correctly and had helper functions for setting TimeTicks, but logic
	  had not been implemented in su_setOID().  * Missing semicolon ;-(
	  * snmp-ups: use NUT's str_to_long() in su_setOID()  Safer
	  conversion from provided strings to instant command or read/write
	  value. Omitted default value if !SU_MODE_INSTCMD because it is not
	  possible for read/write variable functions to be called without a
	  value (unlike instant commands).

	  tracking implementation  (#659)  * INSTCMD and SET VAR status
	  tracking implementation  This commit implements the instant
	  commands (instcmd) and variables settings (setvar) status tracking,
	  to get the actual execution status from the driver   * Missing
	  Revision history   * Fix nut-names.txt modification that should not
	  be here   * Augeas support: add CMDSETSTATUSDELAY for upsd.conf   *
	  INSTCMD and SET VAR status tracking completion  Following Daniele
	  Pezzini thorough review, sanitize and improve the code, and also
	  complete documentation   * INSTCMD and SET VAR status tracking
	  completion  implement support for status tracking in upscmd and
	  upsrw   * upscmd/upsrw: delay retries for status tracking   *
	  Remove comment  There is no need to condition CMDSET_STATUS
	  commands received by upsd from the driver, on
	  cmdset_status_enabled, since what matters is the presence of a list
	  and id   * Complete comment   * UUID v4 implementation  replaced
	  the initial rxi/uuid4 library used by a cross platform version.
	  Though more basic, it is enough for our needs, at least for now   *
	  status_info should be static   * No need for else, since fatalx is
	  called before   * Suppress \n from debug output   * Group sanity
	  checks   * Get rid of dynamic memory allocation   * Improve and
	  enforce the use of UUID4_LEN   * Comment on the size of dest for
	  nut_uuid_v4()   * Move structures and defines to more appropriate
	  places   * Add functions with timeout  Add upscli_sendline_timeout
	  and upscli_readline_timeout, beside from the classic blocking
	  versions. Also make a common define for timeout, and use it in
	  upsclient and nut-scanner   * upscmd/upsrw: add a timeout option
	  * Basic homebrew UUID v4 implementation   * Prefer to use static
	  buffer for UUID   * log actual result of instcmd / setvar   * Fix
	  tracking ID reporting due to static memory changes   * upsclient:
	  use unsigned int for timeouts  Also, explicit that upscli_cleanup()
	  takes no argument.  * upscmd/upsrw: use unsigned int for timeout +
	  our str_to_uint() for it  Also, slightly reword the help message
	  for `-t` (timeout) option, in order to clarify which is the unit
	  (seconds) used for the provided value.  * upscmd/upsrw: don't sleep
	  after receiving a non-PENDING CMDSET_STATUS  Also, remove some
	  nesting in do_cmd() and do_set().  * net-protocol: clarify the
	  format of GET CMDSET_STATUS + <status_id>  <status_id> is not
	  optional to get the status of a command/setvar with CMDSET_STATUS,
	  so drop the [square brackets] from it. Also drop "quotes" in SET
	  CMDSET_STATUS's <value>, since it's expected to be a single word.
	  Plus, fix markup of INSTMCD's <cmdparam> parameter.  *
	  sock-protocol: align case and markup of command parameters  *
	  dstate: fix handling of INSTCMD's optional parameters  We should
	  still support the old `INSTCMD <cmdname> [<cmdparam>]` format, and
	  not only consider <cmdparam> when also `STATUS_ID <id>` is
	  provided.  Also, fix the format of our sock-protocol commands
	  mentioned in comments, and add function names to debug info.  *
	  common: document the recently added things  * upsd: in INSTCMD/SET
	  handlers, also accept NULL for status_id  Plus: - use a simpler
	  approach to test if status_id is not empty, - align the way the SET
	  command is built to the one used for the INSTCMD command.  * upsd:
	  drop unnecessary/unused global  * upsd: move sanity checks of
	  cmdset_status_get() after declaration of vars  Also, drop some
	  nesting in that function.  * Move from CMDSET_STATUS / STATUS_ID to
	  TRACKING  This is just a big, big rename, no code changes.  * upsd:
	  refine the tracking API  Add a couple of functions to change in a
	  predictable way the value of the general enablement of tracking and
	  make it visible only inside upsd.c. Also, move the tracking type
	  (tracking_t) and the list of items inside upsd.c.  * net-protocol:
	  also return TRACKING between OK and <id>, for INSTCMD/SET VAR  *
	  dstate: *really* fix handling of INSTCMD's optional parameters
	  Erroring out on `INSTCMD <cmdname>` doesn't seem like a good
	  idea...  * common: massage default timeouts  Rename the default
	  timeout used in network operations by upsclient and nut-scanner to
	  be more specific: from DEFAULT_TIMEOUT to DEFAULT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT.
	  Plus, make the default timeout used when retrieving the result of
	  an INSTCMD/SET VAR with TRACKING enabled a common #define'd value
	  (DEFAULT_TRACKING_TIMEOUT), and use it also to publish the default
	  value of the -t option in the help messages of upscmd and upsrw.
	  As suggested by Charles Lepple.  * upsd: ignore case of UUID4 in
	  tracking API  Also, remove some nesting in tracking_del().  *
	  libupsclient: generate manpages for
	  upscli_{read,send}line_timeout()  To keep things simple, at least
	  for now, only generate manpages and not html pages (and, as such,
	  don't even think of using our linkman AsciiDoc macro with those
	  functions, to avoid dead links).  * libupsclient: bump version as
	  per recent changes  - addition of upscli_{read,send}line_timeout(),
	  - upscli_cleanup() -> upcli_cleanup(void)  Note: only increase
	  'current' and not 'age', because the upscli_cleanup() change could
	  (potentially) make it not compatible with previous versions.  *
	  upscmd/upsrw: warn that also the drivers need to support TRACKING,
	  for -w  * Fix typo and spelling   * Add check around atoi()
	  conversion

2019-02-25  Roberto Panerai Velloso <rvelloso@gmail.com>

	* drivers/solis.c, drivers/solis.h: solis: various improvements and
	  fixes  - fixed two memory leaks (unnecessary strdup's), - removed
	  ser_flush calls that were causing the driver to desync, -
	  refactored code, mostly bit mainpulation functions, - other minor
	  improvements in source code.

2019-02-03  Daniele Pezzini <hyouko@gmail.com>

	* server/upsd.c: upsd: fix the calling of netcmds items' func()
	  Since, as per our network protocol, it's perfectly legal to have
	  single-word commands (and we already have a few, e.g. VER, NETVER,
	  HELP, ...), we do not do an early check to ensure that at least one
	  argument was provided to the command. As such, the list of words
	  generated by parseconf could actually end with the command itself.
	  That said, trying to access something that should not be there
	  doesn't seem like a good idea, so, only pass to netcmds items'
	  func() the list of arguments (which starts at the second item of
	  the list of words), if there are arguments, otherwise just pass
	  NULL.
	* server/sstate.c: sstate: make sure ADDRANGE/DELRANGE have all the
	  needed parameters  Since ADDRANGE and DELRANGE take 3 arguments
	  (<varname>, <minvalue>, <maxvalue>), we have to ensure all of them
	  were provided, before attempting to use them.
	* drivers/dstate.c: dstate: fix dstate_delrange() socket protocol
	  command  The documented (and used in server-side) command for
	  deleting a range is `DELRANGE <varname> <minvalue> <maxvalue>`, not
	  `DELRANGE <varname> "<minvalue> <maxvalue>"`, as used in
	  dstate_delrange(). So, fix that unused (well, at least in NUT)
	  function to use the correct format.  Also, remove an extraneous
	  additional space in the command used in dstate_addrange().

	* clients/nutclient.cpp, clients/nutclient.h: libnutclient: introduce
	  getDevicesVariableValues() (#654)  A performance bottleneck was
	  identified within the 42ity project, where querying all variable
	  values from 300 ePDUs through upsd and libnutclient took 15 seconds
	  to complete. The new method TcpClient::getDevicesVariableValues()
	  allows querying device variable values in bulk, by sending all LIST
	  VAR commands ahead of time and then parsing all the results at
	  once. Throughput is vastly improved, with the mega-query completing
	  about 15 times faster.

2019-01-28  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* clients/Makefile.am, clients/nutclient.h: libnutclient: fix version
	  and interface  * Library version should be updated to reflect

	  additional argument to instant commands can be optional
	* drivers/eaton-pdu-marlin-mib.c, drivers/hpe-pdu-mib.c: snmp-ups:

	* docs/nut.dict: Fix spellcheck
	* clients/nutclient.cpp, clients/nutclient.h, docs/net-protocol.txt:

	  it yet

2018-09-06  Gabriele Taormina <gabriele.taormina@legrand.com>

	* drivers/metasys.c: metasys: retrieve also battery charge and
	  runtime  The added command is only supported by devices with an 'id
	  code' >= 14, while for other, older, models the command is not
	  enabled by default, and the user has to perform a specific
	  procedure via serial to enable it (where supported).

2018-09-05  Daniele Pezzini <hyouko@gmail.com>

	* drivers/metasys.c: metasys: remove useless initialisation of vars

2018-08-27  Gabriele Taormina <gabriele.taormina@legrand.com>

	* data/driver.list.in, drivers/metasys.c: metasys: support some newer
	  Meta System and Legrand devices  Add to the metasys driver a few
	  new models (Meta System DHEA, and others now branded Legrand)
	  speaking the Meta System UPS protocol.
	* drivers/metasys.c: metasys: treat any '\0' in the serial number as
	  a '0'
	* drivers/metasys.c: metasys: for bypass mode, call status_set() with
	  "BYPASS", not "BY"
	* drivers/metasys.c: metasys: fix handling of errors/special values
	  As per protocol documentation, data is sent by the device with
	  unsigned integers of 8, 16 or 32 bits, with errors/special values
	  being: - for uint16: 0xFFFF and 0xFFFE, - for uint32: 0xFFFFFFFF.
	  Alas, those values are (and, probably, have always been) actually
	  reported in the documentation (mostly) as if their types were not
	  unsigned (so, in decimal: -1, and -2) and the metasys driver used
	  them like that, converting the values to non-fixed width signed
	  types (int and long) and then expecting a value of -1 or -2 to
	  signal a particular event, but this only happens on platforms where
	  int is exactly 16 bits, and long 32 bits. So, leave values as
	  unsigned types (adjusting all the printf formats accordingly), and
	  use the right hex values, instead.
	* data/driver.list.in, drivers/Makefile.am, drivers/legrand-hid.c,
	  drivers/legrand-hid.h, drivers/usbhid-ups.c: usbhid-ups: add
	  Legrand subdriver
	* data/driver.list.in, drivers/nutdrv_qx.c: nutdrv_qx: add support

2018-08-19  Daniele Pezzini <hyouko@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: configure: fix messages of pkg-config checks  The
	  PKG_*() macros we use there already print messages, therefore we
	  can't use AC_MSG_CHECKING() before calling them, and
	  AC_MSG_RESULT() after, or we will get something like:  checking for
	  autoconf macro support of pkg-config... checking for pkg-config...
	  /usr/bin/pkg-config ^^^ AC_MSG_CHECKING()
	  ^^^ PKG_*() macro output checking pkg-config is at least version
	  0.9.0... yes ^^^ PKG_*() macro output -- continuation ok ^^^
	  AC_MSG_RESULT() checking for autoconf macro support of pkg-config
	  module checker... checking for dummy_PKG_CONFIG... yes ^^^
	  AC_MSG_CHECKING()                                               ^^^
	  PKG_*() macro output ok ^^^ AC_MSG_RESULT()  ...which is not
	  exactly desirable.  So, move the messages to AC_MSG_NOTICE(), with
	  the result being explicitly printed only on failure (AC_MSG_WARN()
	  call).
	* docs/man/Makefile.am: docs/man: fix man8 target for linux/i2c
	* docs/man/Makefile.am, drivers/Makefile.am: nutdrv_qx: don't
	  duplicate make targets  Since nutdrv_qx is both a serial and a USB
	  driver, up until now, its executable and manpages appeared in two
	  lists: serial and USB drivers, in order to be built in both cases,
	  when ./configure'd for only one of them... but, by doing this, when
	  ./configure'd for both, we ended up with dupes, which could
	  potentially cause problems, e.g. when installing them (and this
	  just happened).  For the executable, luckily, libtool calls install
	  one file at a time, so this was not, and it still should not be, a
	  problem. For the manpages, we were previously saved by automake,
	  which splits the list of files to be installed in different calls
	  if they are too many (see automake's am__install_max var, currently
	  set to 40), so the two nutdrv_qx entries ended up in different
	  calls to install, but the 8b75b03 commit, by adding more manpages
	  before nutdrv_qx's ones, pushed also the first occurrence to the
	  second call to install, which already contained the other one,
	  causing an error.  While other alternative, more flexible, but also
	  less portable, ways for solving this exist (e.g. using GNU make's
	  $(sort) on the generated lists), at least for now, prefer a more
	  portable solution, adding new intermediate lists for serial/USB
	  drivers and using simple automake conditionals.  Close

	* tools/nut-scanner/nut-scanner.c: nutscanner: get debug level early
	  (for nutscan_init()) and restore options (#541)  * Revert "Problem:
	  nutscan_init() called before debug is enabled"  This reverts commit
	  f613d45f78c96c290a1d63d4a2c3f28385d90d42.  When parsing the command
	  line (or showing help), many options rely on a nutscan_avail_* var
	  already initialized by nutscan_init() -- moving that call after the
	  parsing of opts renders those options unavailable.  * nutscanner:
	  parse debug level opts separately before anything else  In order to
	  have early the value of the desired debug level (needed to
	  correctly debug nutscan_init()), split the parsing of command line
	  options into two loops: - the first one, before the call to
	  nutscan_init(), will only care about debug level, - the second one,
	  after the call to nutscan_init(), will consider the remaining (and
	  possibly depending on a nutscan_avail_* var already initialized by
	  nutscan_init()) arguments (and moan in case of errors).  Closes

	* drivers/nutdrv_qx.c: nutdrv_qx: support USB devices that don't
	  close their replies with a CR  Since some devices, when
	  communicating via USB, don't close their replies to our
	  commands/queries with the expected (and mandated by the specs) CR,
	  rendering the driver almost useless as protocols get one less
	  character than they expect, update the various USB subdrivers
	  (leaving out the ones that rely on a CR to stop reading from the
	  device) to add the missing terminating CR in such cases (as long as
	  we get anything usable). This is a bit of a cheat, but, at least
	  for now, it will do -- not to mention the fact that it is way less
	  invasive than touching all the places of the driver that expect a
	  closing CR and all the qx2nut tables of the various protocols.

	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_usb.c: nutscanner: in scan_usb.c, nullify
	  free()'d pointers that are later reused  We assign 'device_name',
	  'serialnumber' and 'vendor_name' only if the analyzed device
	  provides that data and, since we use these pointers also to check
	  if those items are available so that we can store and free() them,
	  after free()'ing them we must make them NULL, or the next device,
	  if it does not provide that data, will inherit the old (now
	  free()'d) pointer and will attempt to access it and re-free() it.
	* drivers/libusb1.c: libusb1: don't use the same var to iterate both
	  devices and interface descriptor  From our old libusb.c, libusb1.c
	  inherited a for loop that iterates over the interface descriptor in
	  order to try and find the HID descriptor among its 'extra' bytes.
	  Unluckily, it uses the same var (i) that's now used, at the same
	  time, for the iteration through the device list, in which it
	  happens to be nested. Since this obviously spells disaster, make
	  these vars unique (and add a bit of debugging info).

2017-08-23  Christian Ehrhardt <christian.ehrhardt@canonical.com>

	* drivers/Makefile.am: automake: only pass net-snmp cflags to
	  snmp-ups (#464)  Other than formerly assumed in the makefile cflags
	  can be more than includes. And some of them need to be in sync in
	  regard to CFLAGS and LDFLAGS - for example usage of -fPIE.  This
	  conflicts with a current assumption in the makefile "In any case,
	  CFLAGS are only -I options, so there is no harm".  On a
	  Distribution where PIE is enabled by default, but disabled for
	  special cases (like net-snmp) the configure detection gets them as:
	  LIBNETSNMP_CFLAGS = -DNETSNMP_ENABLE_IPV6 -fno-strict-aliasing -g
	  -O2 -fdebug-prefix-map=/build/net-snmp-nlMQSZ/net-snmp-5.7.3+dfsg=.
	  -specs=/usr/share/dpkg/no-pie-compile.specs
	  -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security
	  -DNETSNMP_USE_INLINE -Ulinux -Dlinux=linux -D_REENTRANT
	  -D_GNU_SOURCE -DDEBIAN -fwrapv -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe
	  -I/usr/local/include -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
	  -I/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.26/CORE -Wdate-time
	  -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -I/usr/include LIBNETSNMP_LIBS =
	  -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -specs=/usr/share/dpkg/no-pie-link.specs
	  -Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lnetsnmp
	  -lcrypto -lm  Of importance are:
	  -specs=/usr/share/dpkg/no-pie-compile.specs
	  -specs=/usr/share/dpkg/no-pie-link.specs  Now when compiling the
	  non-snmp objects incorrectly get the
	  "-specs=/usr/share/dpkg/no-pie-compile.specs" due to the assumption
	  that it is safe to add up all CFLAGS to the global one.  LDFLAGS
	  imported that way are only added to snmp. snmp_ups_LDADD =
	  $(LDADD_DRIVERS) $(LIBNETSNMP_LIBS) [...] snmp-ups$(EXEEXT):
	  $(snmp_ups_OBJECTS) $(snmp_ups_DEPENDENCIES)
	  $(EXTRA_snmp_ups_DEPENDENCIES) @rm -f snmp-ups$(EXEEXT)
	  $(AM_V_CCLD)$(LINK) $(snmp_ups_OBJECTS) $(snmp_ups_LDADD) $(LIBS)
	  That leads to other (all non snmp_ups) objects in drivers failing
	  to build. They get the no-pie-compile.specs (incorrect) spec but
	  not the no-pie-link.specs on the link step.  Some other parts like
	  mge_shut and nutdrv_qx already have custom CFLAGS/LDFLAGS that are
	  not added to the global CFLAGS. So despite the commend in the
	  makefile this doesn't seem to be new in general to nut.  I don't
	  want to mess too much with your build system for now as I don't
	  know many of its implications. So I chose not the full drop of that
	  global CFLAGS merge, but a minimal patch for now which fixes the
	  issue described.  Thereby closes #463

	  except for interrupt transfers, where the actual transfer size is
	  stored in a separate variable. The libusb 1.0 implementation in NUT
	  thus needed to be fixed to behave the same way than the libusb 0.1
	  implementation  Reference:

	* drivers/libusb1.c: libusb 1.0 port: remove the check on USB device
	  count  With the port to libusb 1.0, a sanity check was done on the
	  available number of USB devices to try. This however caused a
	  behavior regression, since the only device that NUT may have access
	  to can be the only UPS connected. In this case, the driver may exit
	  upon trying to reconnect if the device is transiently not available
	  Reference: https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/300
	* drivers/libusb1.c, drivers/richcomm_usb.c: libusb 1.0 port:
	  complete usb_set_altinterface code  usb_set_altinterface allows to
	  force the USB code to call `libusb_set_interface_alt_setting (0,
	  0)` (equivalent to `libusb_set_altinterface(0)` in libusb 0.1), as
	  was done in NUT 2.7.2 and earlier. However, the libusb 1.0
	  implementation was still missing the related code  Reference:
	  https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/300
	* drivers/nutdrv_atcl_usb.c, drivers/richcomm_usb.c: libusb 1.0 port:
	  fix kernel driver detachment  Following the recent modification for
	  the kernel driver detachment, and the related functions
	  availability depending on the platforms, nutdrv_atcl_usb and
	  richcomm_usb were using the wrong macro for
	  libusb_set_auto_detach_kernel_driver and were missing the libusb
	  1.0 code for explicit kernel driver detachment  Reference:
	  https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/300

	* drivers/libusb1.c, m4/nut_check_libusb.m4: libusb 1.0 port: rework
	  the kernel driver detachment  libusb 1.0 has introduced a new
	  function (libusb_set_auto_detach_kernel_driver), beside from the
	  explicit kernel driver detachment request
	  (libusb_detach_kernel_driver). However, the former is not available
	  on all systems. As an example, FreeBSD 10.1-10.3 does not have
	  this. The detachment and interface claiming has been reworked to
	  handle this case (reported by Charles Lepple)  Reference:
	  https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/300

	* drivers/libusb1.c: libusb 1.0: remove unused typesafe_control_msg()
	  workaround  For libusb 0.1 implementation, we had to workaround a
	  libusb API goofs, by wrapping the base function usb_control_msg(),
	  and casting the variables to the right type. This is not needed for
	  libusb 1.0 implementation, but was wrongly left in the code
	  (reported by Charles Lepple)

	* drivers/usbhid-ups.c: usbhid-ups/mge-shut: rework errno/errors

	  Subject: [PATCH] snmp-ups: support APC PDU  Based on initial work
	  and data from Opengear, using SNMP subdriver creation script, add
	  support for the more recent APC PDU.  This was tested with a
	  AP8958, but should cover other models

	  From: Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr> Date: Sat, 7 Jun 2014
	  02:27:15 +0200 Subject: [PATCH] Add 'nowait' option for upsdrvctl
	  in ups.conf  The nowait flag allow to tell upsdrvctl to not wait at
	  all for the driver(s) to execute the request command. The default
	  behavior, when this variable is omitted, is to wait 'maxstartdelay'
	  seconds
	* conf/ups.conf.sample: Document and pre-set the "maxretry" option in
	  ups.conf.sample

	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: snmp-ups: Fix counter OID matching  In case of
	  multiple similar sysOID (i.e. same sysOID in different subdrivers),
	  there is a counter matching OID (generally using the model OID).
	  However, the matching was causing a crash of snmp-ups in case where
	  it was not the right MIB mapping and the OID for model entry was
	  not available

	* drivers/eaton-mib.c: snmp-ups: initial daisychain support for Eaton
	  PDU  Following the base implementation for daisychain support in
	  the SNMP driver core (snmp-ups), add support for daisychain for
	  Eaton PDU.  Commands definitions are disabled for now, and will be
	  addressed in a subsequent commit
	* drivers/snmp-ups.c, drivers/snmp-ups.h: snmp-ups: base daisychain
	  support  This commit includes the initial support for daisychain.
	  There are however a number of limitations that still need to be
	  addressed, such as: * {input,output,bypass}.phase handling: for
	  now, mixed / hybrid daisychains are not supported * All devices
	  alarms are pushed to "ups.alarm" without discriminant (i.e. not
	  "device.X" appended to the alarm) * commands and settings are not
	  yet handled * non-regression testing on unitary devices have to be
	  done

	* drivers/nutdrv_qx_voltronic-qs-hex.c: nutdrv_qx: improve protocol
	  identification in 'voltronic-qs-hex'  Since 'V' protocol, in
	  reality, never happens to use the encoded version of the reply to

	  implemented in 'voltronic-qs' subdriver, remove it from the
	  identification process of 'voltronic-qs-hex' subdriver. Also,
	  remove some non-significant entries from the testing table and
	  increase version number.
	* drivers/nutdrv_qx_voltronic-qs-hex.c: nutdrv_qx: harmonize

	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: snmp-ups: implement 3-phase alarm handling
	  snmp-ups now allows to publish 3-phase alarms in ups.alarm, the
	  same way as with outlet.  Declaration of such alarms are done using
	  "Lx.alarm". info_lkp_t structures messages are shared templates
	  with outlets, and use the string formats to include the context
	  (outlet or phase) and the number (of the outlet or phase) in alarm
	  messages.  These alarms are then published in "ups.alarm", with the
	  standard mechanism for alarm publication
	* docs/nut-names.txt: Extend 3-phase collection namespace with alarms
	  3-phase data collection now allows to specify alarms, the same way
	  than with the outlet collection ("outlet.n.alarm"), but using

	  be sufficient but already provides a bit more room
	* drivers/eaton-mib.c: snmp-ups: outlet alarm handling for Eaton ePDU
	  Eaton ePDU can now handle alarms on outlets, currently limited to

	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: snmp-ups: implement outlets / PDU alarm
	  handling  snmp-ups now allows to publish outlets and PDU alarms in
	  ups.alarm, the same way as with ups.status.  Declaration of such
	  alarms are done using the outlet template mechanism
	  ("outlet.%i.alarm"). info_lkp_t structures messages can also use
	  the string formats to include the outlet number in alarm messages.
	  These alarms are then published in "ups.alarm", with the standard
	  mechanism for alarm publication
	* docs/nut-names.txt: Extend outlet collection namespace with alarms

	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: Proper handling of integer RW variables  RW

	  setting float values, not only integer
	* drivers/snmp-ups.c, drivers/snmp-ups.h: Fix default SNMP retries
	  and timeout  The previous patch was using the default values from
	  Net-SNMP, which are set to -1. When the user was not providing
	  overriden values, this was causing the driver to not be able to
	  establish the communication with the device. The default values are
	  now fixed, as per documented (i.e. 5 retries and timeout of 1

2015-08-24  Daniele Pezzini <hyouko@gmail.com>

	* README.adoc, docs/asciidoc.conf: docs: add 'linksingledoc' AsciiDoc
	  macro  Add a new 'linksingledoc' AsciiDoc macro which guarantees
	  that, when chunked HTML is generated, the link always points to a
	  non-chunked file.
	* README.adoc: Update some URLs and make them clickable
	* docs/asciidoc.conf: Make AsciiDoc xref macros work properly in
	  DocBook-generated docs  AsciiDoc <= ~8.6.9 tests the wrong
	  attribute and, as a consequence of that, it produces both <link>
	  and <xref>. To workaround this issue, implement the xref macro by
	  ourselves.
	* README.adoc: Remove a couple of end-of-line spaces
	* README.adoc, docs/chunked.xsl, docs/download.txt, docs/support.txt:
	  Make cross references work in both GitHub and generated docs
	  Substitute the shorthand '<< >>' syntax with attributes that
	  conditionally expand to: - links on GitHub (references can point at
	  most to a section of level docs/common.xsl's
	  <chunk.section.depth>), - xref macros when generating docs.  In
	  order to achieve the result, 'chunked' docs get now their pages
	  named after IDs. So, update all the links that use the old
	  auto-generated names.  Reference:
	  https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/pull/226
	* README.adoc: Make links to docs/manpages work in both GitHub and
	  generated docs  Since GitHub doesn't allow custom macros, only use
	  ours when generating docs, replacing their occurrences with
	  attributes that produce links when on GitHub. This approach should
	  work properly as long as we use them in contexts where attributes
	  are evaluated and substituted before macros.  Also, use a common
	  attribute that points to the URL of the website.  Reference:
	  https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/pull/226
	* README.adoc: Make nutdrv_qx the 'generic device driver' for Q*
	  protocols  As the link was still pointing to the old -no longer
	  generated- 'blazer' manpage, take the chance to reword the
	  paragraph so that it points to the new nutdrv_qx driver.

	* drivers/powerware-mib.c: Add ups.start.auto for Powerware SNMP  Use

	  restart when mains power is applied.
	* drivers/powerware-mib.c: Fix some indentation problems in PowerWare
	  SNMP
	* drivers/powerware-mib.c: Add shutdown.return for Powerware SNMP
	  The Powerware MIB supports the concept of shutting down with a
	  delay and then returning when line power is restored. The delay is
	  set to 0 seconds currently.
	* drivers/powerware-mib.c: Add load.{off,on}.delay for Powerware SNMP
	  The commands to shut down with delay have existed since the first
	  version of the Powerware MIB so add the newer commands
	  "load.off.delay" and "load.on.delay" to aid in shutdown scripts.

	* drivers/tripplitesu.c: tripplitesu: Fix initialization when
	  tripplite firmware is buggy  With some Tripplite SU1000RT2U (and
	  possibly more) UPS's, a firmware bug causes a malformed response to
	  the very first command that is sent after the serial port is opened
	  following a warm or cold boot of the system. My theory is that this
	  related to either the RS232 data lines or handshaking lines being
	  pulled high once the server's UART is powered however I have not
	  determined precisely if this is related to the data line being
	  pulled high or the handshaking lines being asserted. However, I
	  have been able to consistently reproduce the issue where the driver
	  fails to start on the first attempt after a cold/warm boot across 3
	  different machines and 2 SU1000RT2U UPS's. To workaround this, the
	  initial enumeration is repeated a 2nd time after 300ms(to allow all
	  garbage data to arrive) if the first attempt fails, which allows
	  the driver to consistently startup successfully on the 1st attempt.
	  Closes networkupstools/nut#220

	  one, warn whenever there are remaining HID objects that were not
	  processed. This may serve
	* drivers/hidtypes.h: Increase the maximum number of HID objects  The

	* drivers/libshut.c, drivers/libshut.h, drivers/libusb.c,
	  drivers/usb-common.h, drivers/usbhid-ups.c: Add support for Eaton
	  dual HID report descriptor  All devices use HID descriptor at index
	  0. However, some newer Eaton units have a light HID descriptor at
	  index 0, and the full version is at index 1 (in which case,
	  bcdDevice == 0x0202). This dual report descriptor approach is due
	  to the fact that the main report descriptor is now too heavy, and
	  cause some BIOS to hang. A light version is thus provided at the
	  default index, solving this BIOS issues

	  In OS X 10.9 and earlier, IOPSGetPowerSourcesInfo() returned a
	  CFDictionary. In 10.10 it returns a CFArray. Programmers are
	  supposed to use IOPSGetPowerSourceDescription() to gloss over this
	  distinction.  However, this does not make it easy to distinguish
	  between a laptop battery and an UPS. So the "port" driver option no
	  longer has any effect.

	* docs/man/ups.conf.txt, drivers/dstate.c, drivers/dstate.h,
	  drivers/main.c: Implement synchronous driver flag  As per issue
	  #197, NUT drivers work by default in asynchronous mode. This means
	  that all data are pushed by the driver on the communication socket
	  to upsd (Unix socket on Unix, Named pipe on Windows) without
	  waiting for these data to be actually consumed.  With some HW, such
	  as ePDUs, that can produce a lot of data, asynchronous mode may
	  cause some congestion, resulting in the socket to be full, and the
	  driver to appear as not connected.  By enabling the 'synchronous'
	  flag, the driver will wait for data to be consumed by upsd, prior
	  to publishing more.  This can be enabled either globally or per
	  driver.

	  advanced features  Closes: #158  Added setvar function exec result
	  parsing  Add command to turn load on after shutdown.stayoff and

	  outlet.n.staus now only for reading.  Some code changes in
	  outlet.n.shutdown.return command -  now supporting more than 3
	  outlets (up to 9).  Add descriptions to new and some old variables

	  low (in minutes) - battery.energysave.realpower: to switch off the
	  UPS if running on battery and power consumption on UPS output is

	* drivers/nutdrv_qx.c: nutdrv_qx: prevent a vicious loop when
	  unexpected answers happen  If a 'QX_FLAG_QUICK_POLL' item gets an
	  unexpected (non-empty) answer and, after returning from
	  'qx_ups_walk()', it is not followed by at least one item using a
	  different 'command', the driver will loop endlessly using the same
	  'broken' answer instead of trying to get a new one from the UPS. To
	  solve this issue, make sure to have an empty 'previous_item' when
	  starting 'qx_ups_walk()'. Also, bail out of 'qx_ups_walk()' when a
	  'QX_FLAG_QUICK_POLL' item can't be preprocessed properly through
	  'ups_infoval_set()'.

	  Add new 'Q1' subdriver. This subdriver implements the same protocol
	  as the one used by the 'megatec' subdriver minus the vendor (I) and
	  ratings (F) queries. In the claim function: - it doesn't even try
	  to get 'vendor' informations (I) - it checks only status (Q1),
	  through 'input.voltage' variable Therefore it should be able to
	  work even if the UPS doesn't support vendor/ratings *and* the user
	  doesn't use the 'novendor'/'norating' flags, as long as: - the UPS
	  replies a Q1-compliant answer (i.e. not necessary filled with all
	  of the Q1-required data, but at least of the right length and with
	  not available data filled with some replacement character) - the
	  UPS reports a valid input.voltage (used in the claim function) -
	  the UPS reports valid status bits (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th are the
	  mandatory ones)  This commit reintroduces a functionality of the
	  blazer subdrivers that was lost because now, in order to tell
	  whether a device is supported by a subdriver or not, if the user
	  doesn't call the driver with the 'novendor' flag, both the status
	  (Q1) and the vendor (I/FW?) queries are needed (that's to better
	  discern the subdrivers).  Reference:

	  Provide retry options for upsdrvctl and driver(s)  As recently seen
	  in Debian (bugs #694717 and #677143), it may be required to have
	  upsdrvctl retrying to start the driver in case of failure.  More
	  specifically, a mix of init system (V and systemd), udev and USB
	  device(s) can result in the /dev entry not being available at
	  driver startup, thus resulting in a general failure to start NUT.
	  This commit provides at least a way to overcome this issue. A more
	  suitable  solution will require more work on NUT design.  This
	  patch if based on Arnaud Quette proposal

	  docs/new-drivers.txt, drivers/Makefile.am, drivers/al175.c: al175:
	  updated driver, please restore it  Back in 2005 I was young and
	  idealistic, that's why you finally marked al175 as 'broken', but
	  now I understand your points (some) and that in NUT you need good
	  portability.  So this time I've checked that al175 compiles with
	  CC="gcc -std=c89 -pedantic", and CC="gcc -std=c99 -pedantic"  Also,
	  I've tried to clean-up the driver based on feedback from 2009, but
	  unfortunately I no longer have hardware to test and will not have
	  any in foreseable future, so the driver was reworked to meet the
	  project code quality criteria, without testing on real hardware.
	  Some bugs may have crept in.  Changes since last posting in 2009:
	  - patch rebased on top of current master (v2.6.5-400-g214c442); -
	  added reference to COMLI communication protocol document; - status
	  decode errors go to log, instead of setting non-conformant status
	  like "?T", "?OOST", etc.  For such errors new loglevel is
	  allocated; - "High Battery" status is back; - converted tracing
	  macros to direct use of upsdebugx and numbers 1,2,3,4 for loglevels
	  as requested (but now lines got longer because of explicit __func__
	  usage); - lowered usage of other macros (e.g. REVERSE_BITS
	  inlined); - alarm(3) is not used anymore - instead whole I/O
	  transaction time budget is maintained manually; - man page
	  converted to asciidoc and supported variables list is merged into
	  it;  - upsdebug_ascii moved to common.c and to separate patch.
	  ~~~~  Changes since al175 was removed from NUT tree in 2008:  -
	  alloca was eliminated through the help of automatic variables -
	  debugging/tracing were reworked to (almost always) use NUT builtins
	  - al175 now uses 3 debug levels for (1=user-level info, 2=protocol
	  debugging, 3=I/O tracing)  - rechecked
	  http://eu1.networkupstools.org/doc/2.2.0/developers.html and
	  applied where apporpiate  Also  > This driver does not support
	  upsdrv_shutdown(), which makes > it not very useful in a real world
	  application. This alone > warrants 'experimental' status, but for
	  the below mentioned > reasons (to name a few), it's flagged
	  'broken' instead.  Yes, at present shutdown is not supported, and
	  unfortunately now I don't have AL175 hardware at hand, so that I
	  can't write it and verify the implementation.  I've marked the
	  driver as DRV_EXPERIMENTAL, although it was tested by us as part of
	  our systems to work OK for more than three years in production
	  environment on ships (and we don't need shutdown there -- in
	  critical situations the system has to operate as long as possible,
	  untill the battery is empty)  Also, all of the previous issues
	  listed below are now fixed in this al175 version:  - ‘return’
	  with a value, in function returning void (2x) - anonymous variadic
	  macros were introduced in C99 - C++ style comments are not allowed
	  in ISO C90 - ISO C forbids braced-groups within expressions (5x) -
	  ISO C90 forbids specifying subobject to initialize (16x) - ISO C99
	  requires rest arguments to be used (18x)  Yes, "All the world is
	  not an x86 Linux box," and I've tried to make all the world happy.
	  Please apply.  Thanks, Kirill.
	* common/common.c, docs/developers.txt, include/common.h: common:
	  upsdebug_ascii() - to dump a message in ascii  For debugging
	  ASCII-based protocols with control characters (e.g. COMLI) it is
	  handy to dump messages not in hex, but in ascii with human readable
	  codes.  Add utility function to do it.

	* docs/stable-hcl.txt: HCL: typos
	* data/driver.list.in, docs/stable-hcl.txt: HCL: minor cleanup
	  Remove a duplicate Tripp Lite entry, and add a missing "a".
	* docs/stable-hcl.txt: HCL documentation: reword
	* data/driver.list.in, docs/acknowledgements.txt: HCL: incorporate
	  Tripp Lite test results  Source:
	  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.monitoring.nut.user/8173
	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/website/Makefile.am: HCL: additional
	  dependencies  Apparently still not complete, though.
	* docs/website/scripts/nut_jquery.js: HCL JavaScript: make key
	  case-insensitive  Also special-case the spelling change for Tripp
	  Lite.  TODO: make the value matching case-insensitive as well.
	* docs/website/scripts/nut_jquery.js: HCL JavaScript: update the
	  USB-matching code  Slightly more accurate, but later on we should
	  really track the connection type as a first-class attribute for
	  each entry in the HCL. Matching the driver name is brittle.
	* docs/website/scripts/nut_jquery.js, tools/nut-hclinfo.py: HCL
	  generation: don't combine driver names  The Python and JavaScript
	  code for generating the HCL was combining adjacent drivers even
	  when the support level was different. This clutters up the driver
	  list a bit, but presents a more accurate picture of support levels.

	* drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: Reformat code, remove tabs in the middle
	  of lines. No code changes  After re-reading the developer code
	  style guide, use spaces and not tabs in the middle of lines to
	  align text
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Refactor code, use if-else if rather than
	  4 if statements

2013-08-08  Alf Høgemark <alf@i100.no>

	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Add parameter to nut_find_infoval to
	  control debug output  We do not want debug output if
	  nut_find_infoval does not find a mapped value in all cases. For
	  example, when a command byte is not mapped to a instcmd, we do not
	  want debug output.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: Remove
	  PW_UPDATE_POWER_SOURCE_STATUS_COMMAND, it seems very unlikely to be
	  used
	* drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: Cosmetic changes constant definitions. No
	  code changes.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: Use command map to
	  control which instcmd are supported  Use the command map info
	  retrieved from UPS to list all commands supported by the UPS at
	  debug level 2. Use the info from command map to set up which
	  instcmd the UPS supports.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Use info_lkp_t structure for mapping
	  topology info  Make code simpler by using the info_lkp_t structure
	  for mapping value from topology block to text presented to user as
	  ups.description
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Cosmetic commentary fixes and remove some
	  empty lines. No code changes
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Output unsupported alarms on debug level
	  3, not level 2  The supported alarms in alarm map is outputted at
	  debug level 2. The unsupported alarms should be outputted at debug
	  level 3, it is not that interesting. Also remove debug outputted
	  empty line after table heading line for meter map and alarm map.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Refactor code for setting which alarms
	  are supported, to avoid code duplication  Refactor the code which
	  checks the alarm map for supported alarms, by making a new method
	  which checks the alarm bit to see if the alarm is supported.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Only include ups.serial and device.part
	  if they have a value  Only set info about ups.serial and
	  device.part if the UPS actually report useful info for these.
	  Remove the handling of space characters as meaning string
	  termination for ups.serial, this is not done for part number, and
	  according to bcmxcp spec are these both 16 byte ascii text
	  messages. Move Nominal output frequence handling up, placing it
	  just below Nominal output voltage

	* docs/man/index.txt, docs/man/voltronic_ser.txt,
	  docs/man/voltronic_usb.txt: voltronic* documentation updates  - Add
	  to man page index - Reword a few sections - Fix typos - Comment out
	  USB section in voltronic_ser.txt  Long-term, we should probably
	  figure out a better way to maintain two parallel driver pages like
	  this. The blazer man page is the same for both, with .so links for
	  the man pages, but then you have USB info in a serial driver page.
	  For now, voltronic_usb.txt is just a copy of voltronic_ser.txt with
	  a few _ser-to-_usb replacements.

	  Address the second task and closes Github issue #30
	* clients/upsclient.c: Fix a minor regression in upsclient output
	  NSS support has introduced a minor regression in upsclient output.
	  Clients such as upsc, upscmd and upsrw were particularly affected.

	  calculate it if the UPS can report the ups.load directly
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Use defined constants in setvar, and
	  handle BCMXCP_RETURN_ACCEPTED_PARAMETER_ADJUST  Use the defined
	  constants from header file, instead of magic numbers in setvar
	  method. Add handling of BCMXCP_RETURN_ACCEPTED_PARAMETER_ADJUST.
	  Report upsdrv_comm_good on successful execution of setvar to UPS.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: Add handling of
	  BCMXCP_RETURN_ACCEPTED_PARAMETER_ADJUST and others in ACK block
	  Add support for handling more return statuses when exeucting
	  commands, the most important being
	  BCMXCP_RETURN_ACCEPTED_PARAMETER_ADJUST, which means the command
	  was executed. The others added all handles cases where command was
	  not executed, but you now get a more detailed entry in log as to
	  why it was not executed.

	  we send a command to UPS and get status back from UPS.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: Define byte for

	  and instcmd, let the upsdrv_shutdown method first try to issue a
	  shutdown.return instcmd, and then proceed with shutdown.stayoff if
	  the shutdown.return failed. This seems to be in line with what the

	* drivers/bestfcom.c: bestfcom: Use fc.idealbvolts for calculating
	  percent charge  'I have a Best Ferrups 3.1KVA and I noticed that
	  the percent battery voltage reported from upsc never gets above
	  69.9%.  I believe there is a mistake in the driver.  The battery
	  percentage is calculated based on the High Battery Alarm Setpoint
	  (59.6V) instead of the Ideal Voltage which is about 54V (4
	  batteries x 13.6V).  I examined the source code and found that the
	  variable fc.fullvolts is the result of querying parameter 67 from
	  the UPS.  This parameter is defined per Ferrups Tip 503 as: "The
	  battery voltage at which the UPS sound a High Battery alarm"  A
	  better value to use in determining the percent battery voltage
	  would be fc.idealbvolts which is calculated in the driver source...
	  I propose the following patch to fix the battery.charge (% battery
	  full) reading.'  Ref:

	* docs/nut-names.txt: Add device.uptime to nut-names.txt  Also fix
	  one typo.
	* docs/man/apcsmart.txt, drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: allow users to
	  select non-canonical tty mode  The main reason behind this addition
	  is windows compatibility, see
	  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.monitoring.nut.user/7762  IGNCR
	  has been readded earlier in commit
	  20c52bee77fa0b3ea3c7f8bec25afd103b7ff4a2 - this might be enough to
	  handle windows behavior, but if it's not the case - using non

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c: apcsmart: change

	  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.monitoring.nut.user/7762 - 2
	  digit values reported through 'b' are really >255V voltage values.
	  So we match whole 00 - FF set as single (fake) compat entry.

2013-04-15  Michal Soltys <soltys@ziu.info>

	* drivers/apcsmart.h: apcsmart: re-add CR to ignore sets  Despite

	  fashion analogous to IGNCR flag.  See
	  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.monitoring.nut.user/7762 for
	  rationale.
	* drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c: apcsmart: add regex format to
	  ambient.0.temperature  'T' might (on older units) also mean "ups
	  uptime", so we want to distinguish that case gracefully. The
	  formats are:  uptime: 000.0 temp: 00.00

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: move variable regex matching
	  into vartab  This also allows us to properly validate (in near
	  future) cases when single apc variable can match multiple nut
	  variables.  Other changes:  - adjust rexhlp() to follow 0 for false
	  and non-0 for true, like in the rest of the functions - remove
	  valid_cmd() as rexhlp() can be used directly with formats in the
	  table; furthermore the warning (in case of failure) could be
	  confusing when we add nut:apc n:1 case

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: implement #311678 (multiple
	  values per variable)  This is a bit more general than the original
	  request.  All variables that return multiple comma-separated
	  values, are added as *.N.* where 1 <= N <= APC_PACK_MAX; the
	  variables are stored with temporary name *.0.* in apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  but only at least 1 and at most 4 are added per update run
	  (superfluous - if any - are removed), with *.0.* placeholder being
	  ignored.  We assume that the particular variables cannot belong to
	  the capability set at the same time (as reported by user) -
	  otherwise we will need a bit more complex handling, including
	  updates to all setvar functions.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h: apcsmart: update logging
	  logic / apc_read()  - logging  This mostly adds few macros that
	  implicitly use or pass caller's name (and in case of hard errors,
	  line number). This allows removal of a few "failed" / "succeeded"
	  lines (which in practice don't really happen), for example there is
	  no need for:  upslogx(LOG_ERR, "preread_data: apc_write failed");
	  as any hard error will be reported by apc_write() internally,
	  providing the place and line number it was called at.  Similarly,
	  some upslogx / upsdebugx calls were wrapped in analogous macros to
	  provide caller's name automatically.  Debug levels (-D) were
	  adjusted to require only one letter.  - apc_read()  It's been a bit
	  more scrutinized:  - filling up full caller's buffer is considered
	  an error; shouldn't happen unless the ups is somehow damaged or
	  some model is capable of returning more than 512 bytes in one read
	  (current max I witnessed is around 270 bytes during capability
	  read) - timeout reads (whether it's allowed or not) cannot really
	  have any non-0 count, though sanity check could theoretically be
	  useful in non-canonical mode; commented out code was added for
	  reference
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: enhance prtchr()  So it can handle 4
	  returns with static pointers.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: allow timeout on read in smartmode()
	  As this function is used to "nudge" ups, we should expect it to
	  timeout.  Also avoids extra log spam.

	  "stub" subdriver. This will make it a lot easier and quicker to
	  create subdrivers for snmp-ups. A new documentation chapter has
	  also been added ("How to make a new subdriver to support another
	  SNMP device")
	* drivers/tripplite-hid.c: Add support for newer TrippLite
	  Smart1500LCD  Add newer TrippLite Smart1500LCD (USB ID
	  0x09ae:0x3016) to the list of usbhid-ups supported models (reported
	  by Steve Salier)

2012-12-12  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/mge-hid.c: Fix crash with debug level greater or equal to 2

2012-12-10  Michal Soltys <msoltyspl-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: add prtchr() helper  Add prtchr()
	  helper and simplify reporting when we check whether some APC
	  cmd/var character is or isn't printable.
	* drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c: apcsmart: apc_cmdtab[] fixup  Earlier
	  commit that adjusted regex checks, also changed cmd fields for all
	  instant commands handled by custom functions. We cannot do that, as
	  they are not detected as supported this way.

2012-12-08  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/mge-utalk.c, drivers/mge-utalk.h: Change Martin Loyer's
	  mail address  As per Martin's request.
	* drivers/mge-utalk.c: Improve mge-utalk general behavior  Make two
	  adjustments to improve the general behavior: first, send the double
	  "Z" prior to "Si" command. Second, inter-commands delay has been
	  increased to comply with the specification

2012-12-08  Michal Soltys <msoltyspl-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: serial related stuff a bit more
	  strict  Also:  - apc_flush() now loops with >0 condition (otherwise
	  errored apc_read() might cause inf loop) - ser_comm_good/fail()
	  were kind of missing in write wrappers
	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h: apcsmart:
	  sdlist/sdtype/advorder changes  - verify 'advorder' with regex -
	  remove unused defines - as the user is directed towards man page
	  either way (and without it numbers are kind of meaningless), drop
	  SDMAX
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: setup port after variable
	  sanitization in upsdrv_initups()
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: cleanup dstate ok/stale calls
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: getbaseinfo() fixup  In extremely
	  unlikely case of failing write, report it up and act accordingly.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: adjust regex logic  A bit
	  simpler / tighter now.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: add var_string_setup()  In theory
	  deprecate_vars() should also consider APC_STRING variables. In
	  practice - we don't have any variables that are both APC_MULTI and
	  APC_STRING - but it's more correct this way, so let's do it.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: cosmetics  - code shuffling,
	  comments, flow - rename query_ups() -> legacy_verify() - add few
	  lines of help directing to man page
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: simplify query_ups() /
	  proto_verification()  Both functions rely now on common variable
	  verificaion function.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: add var_verify()  The function will
	  be used in subsequent commit for common verification.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: shuffle two functions  query_ups()
	  and oldapcsetup()
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: simplify query_ups()  This commit
	  changes query_ups() function and makes it rely on the same
	  deprecate_vars() logic that protocol_verify() requires.  We can
	  shorten the code a bit now, and it allows us to do more
	  simplifications in subsequent commits.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: add functions informing about
	  [un]supported cmds/vars  In unified fashion, instead of each
	  protocol-verification related function doing it on its own.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: minor tidying up  comments,
	  trivial changes, code shuffling ...
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: remove unused field 'def' from cchar
	  In apc_ser_diff() reporting differences between
	  tcgetattr/tcsetattr, 'def' field was unused (along with related
	  defines).

2012-11-21  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* docs/acknowledgements.txt: Complete Acknowledgements with a Riello
	  entry  Riello deserves a dedicated entry in the Supporting UPS
	  manufacturers, for having provided protocols information and

	  from Riello)

2012-11-20  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* clients/upsclient.h, server/nut_ctype.h: Fix NSS include directives
	  The current NSS include directives (nss/nss.h) were incorrect.
	  These were failing on Redhat systems, and working on some others
	  because of the default include path (reported by Michal Hlavinka,
	  from Redhat)

2012-11-19  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	  Fix Buildbot failures on previous commit (man pages)  The merge of
	  the libnutclient branch caused a failure of the 'distcheck-light'
	  test target. Manual pages documentation in this branch uses a
	  mechanism to generate multiple manpages from one source file. This
	  was however conflicting with a Makefile rule, that requires the
	  generated file to have the same name as the source file. Applies
	  the same principle by adding the content of the Header section to
	  the NAME commands list. Also fix a typo error in the Header section
	  of libnutclient_devices

	* scripts/subdriver/gen-usbhid-subdriver.sh: Fix USB HID subdriver

	* docs/man/.gitignore, docs/man/blazer.txt: Fix blazer manual pages
	  generation  to generate blazer, blazer_ser and blazer_usb manual
	  pages. The same manual page is now distributed and available under
	  these 3 names (warning to packagers)
	* docs/man/Makefile.am, docs/man/asciidoc.conf: Fix manpage
	  refmiscinfo attributes and multiple NAME  refmiscinfo attributes
	  were previously specified through asciidoc.conf. This approach
	  prevented from specifying and generating multiple manual pages from
	  a single source. Moreover, manversion (pointing NUT version) was
	  mistyped, and thus omitted. Makefile rules now directly define
	  refmiscinfo through attributes, and allow to solve the long
	  standing blazer / blazer_ser / blazer_usb related issue, and the
	  upcoming libnutclient one

	* drivers/tripplite_usb.c: Remove POD ("Plain Old Documentation")

	* drivers/apc-mib.c: APC SNMP MIB update and completion  Add
	  available high precision values, new variables
	  (input.transfer.reason, battery.current.total and ups.test.date),
	  and move ambient.{temperature,humidity}.{high,low} to ambient.1.*,
	  since they relate to alarm threshold of external probe 1 (patch
	  from Hong-Gunn Chew)
	* docs/nut-names.txt: Clarify the use of multiple ambient sensors
	  Multiple sensors can be exposed using the indexed notation.
	  'ambient.*', without index or using '0', relates to the embedded
	  sensor. For example: 'ambient.temperature' represent the embedded
	  sensor temperature. Other sensors (external, communication card,
	  ...) can use indexes from '1' to 'n'. For example:
	  'ambient.1.temperature' for the first external sensor temperature.
	* docs/nut-names.txt: NUT namespace completion  Add two new variables
	  'ups.test.date' and 'battery.current.total'. Also add a note on the

	* common/parseconf.c: Fix CVE-2012-2944: upsd can be remotely crashed
	  NUT server (upsd), from versions 2.4.0 to 2.6.3,  are exposed to
	  crashes when receiving random data from the network.  This issue is
	  related to the way NUT parses characters, especially from the
	  network. Non printable characters were missed from strings
	  operation (such as strlen), but still copied to the buffer, causing
	  an overflow.  Thus, fix NUT parser, to only allow the subset Ascii
	  charset from Space to ~  (Reported by Sebastian Pohle, Alioth bug

	* drivers/belkin-hid.c: Fix Liebert firmware (incorrect exponents)
	  There are at least two Liebert firmware types which both report a
	  VID:PID of 10af:0001. The newer ones tend not to have the Belkin
	  broken Usage Pages (and therefore use standard HID PDC paths) but

2012-05-16  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h: Final fix to the
	  tcsetattr() / tcgetattr() issue  The most likely cause of all
	  spurious differences between what was set on the port with
	  tcsetattr() and what tcgetattr() shows are likely to do with the
	  c_local PENDIN flag, which is a status bit, not a control bit. It
	  will change when there's unread pending input, which can be quite
	  often on an APC UPS.  The right way to compare struct termios
	  values is to clear the status flags _after_ the tcsetattr() and of
	  course after the tcgetattr() call and then compare the result with
	  what was set.  Also set NOKERNINFO, if available, as we don't want
	  the UPS or noise on the line to accidentally trigger status output
	  back to the UPS, and finally make sure IEXTEN is also cleared along
	  with ISIG since it too can cause weird things to happen.  This
	  change also adds some debug code to show any differences in the
	  structures in a logical manner in debug output (and squashes one
	  tiny compiler warning) (patch from Greg A. Woods)
	* docs/config-notes.txt, docs/man/upsmon.txt: Whitespace fixes
	  Remove some extraneous spaces, suggested by "git diff --check", and

	* drivers/libshut.c: Avoid stack corruption on invalid frame  In the

	  buffer is only 8 bytes long. If the frame is corrupted, the size
	  read may be up to 15, which may corrupt the stack while writing
	  into the frame buffer. This patch add a simple sanity check on the

	  flexible '=' character managment in conf files  This allow to
	  support the following forms : 'foo = bar', 'foo=bar', 'foo =bar'
	  and 'foo= bar'

2012-03-06  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

2012-03-05  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/blazer.c, drivers/blazer_ser.c, drivers/blazer_usb.c:
	  Guesstimate battery high and low voltages  Add an automatic
	  estimation for high and low voltages, to be able to determine
	  battery charge. This should cover most cases, but a bold mention
	  has been added at driver startup, to inform the user. Driver
	  version (USB and serial) have been bumped to reflect this change
	* drivers/blazer.c: Set 'FSD' status flag upon need  As per the
	  recent decision to allow driver to set 'FSD' status flag, set 'FSD'
	  upon "Shutdown imminent" detection

2012-03-02  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* autogen.sh, scripts/augeas/Makefile.am: Sanity check before python

	  import required Python modules (re,glob,codecs)
	* docs/man/blazer.txt: Fix typo error in runtimecal example values
	* docs/stable-hcl.txt: Improve formating
	* docs/new-drivers.txt: Formalize the use of the FSD status flag  As
	  an exception, drivers are now allowed to set the "FSD" (Forced
	  ShutDown) status flag when an imminent shutdown has been detected

2012-02-29  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* clients/upsc.c, docs/man/upsc.txt: Client side implementation of
	  "LIST CLIENT"  Implement "LIST CLIENT" in upsc, using "-c <device
	  name>"
	* docs/net-protocol.txt, server/netlist.c: Adjust server side
	  implementation of "LIST CLIENT"  Commands of the "LIST" family have
	  to be coherent with the command name. Ie, "LIST CLIENT" should use
	  the same "CLIENT" prefix, or it will otherwise break client side
	  verification mechanism
	* server/netlist.c: Adjust "LIST CLIENTS" implementation  Adjust
	  "LIST CLIENTS" implementation to be more coherent with other
	  network protocol commands
	* docs/net-protocol.txt: Document new "LIST CLIENTS" command
	* server/upsd.c, server/upsd.h: Remove upsd "info" command  Adjust
	  initial "LIST CLIENTS" commit, by removing the upsd "info" command,
	  which is not suitable, and redundant with the "LIST CLIENT" command
	  of the network protocol  [Fixed compilation error]

2012-02-29  Charles Lepple <clepple+nut@gmail.com>

	* scripts/python/module/PyNUT.py: Add support for LIST CLIENTS, etc.
	  to PyNUT.  Patch by Rene Martín Rodríguez <rmrodri@ull.edu.es>.
	  Merged with typo fixes in repository.  Covers LIST CLIENTS, FSD,
	  HELP and VER. Module version bumped to 1.2.2.  Discussion:
	  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.monitoring.nut.devel/5871
	* server/netlist.c, server/upsd.c, server/upsd.h: Add new "LIST
	  CLIENTS" command to NUT protocol.  Patch by Rene Martín Rodríguez
	  <rmrodri@ull.edu.es>, with indentation changed to tabs.
	  Discussion:
	  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.monitoring.nut.devel/5870
	* drivers/blazer.c: Update URL to Megatec protocol description.

2012-02-28  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/liebert-hid.c: UPower optimization  Always spell
	  manufacturer names the same way across the various USB drivers.
	  This avoids duplication of manufacturer entries in
	  scripts/upower/95-upower-hid.rules, during automatic generation

2012-02-27  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* data/driver.list.in, drivers/cps-hid.c: Add support for CyberPower
	  OR700LCDRM1U  Add CyberPower OR700LCDRM1U (0x0764:0x0601) to the
	  list of usbhid-ups supported models (reported by Brian McCann)

2012-02-22  Michal Soltys <msoltyspl-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: setvar_string() and apc_write_long() bugfixes
	  setvar_string() couldn't function properly, due to the use of wrong
	  variable.  Not associated with any bugreport (reported directly to
	  email).
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: make tcsetattr()/tcgetattr() difference not
	  fatal  This is follow up from earlier bug report (#313395). Earlier
	  commit should have fixed the issue, but the original submitter
	  never commented on it.  Just in case - instead of making it fatal,
	  we only log the issue.

2012-02-20  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/snmp-ups.c, tools/nut-scanner/scan_snmp.c: Better handling
	  of Net-SNMP AES PrivProtocol  Handle smartly issues related to
	  Net-SNMP support and declaration of AES PrivProtocol

2012-02-19  Charles Lepple <clepple+nut@gmail.com>

	* drivers/snmp-ups.c, drivers/snmp-ups.h: Don't allocate storage for
	  variables in snmp-ups.h  The header files should declare variables
	  as extern, and they should be allocated in only one .c file (not
	  all of the files which include the .h file). While this is not an
	  immediate problem when only one .c file includes the .h file, it
	  still should be fixed in case that changes in the future.  Patch by
	  Daniel Macks:
	  http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fink/experimental/dmacks/finkinfo/nut.patch?revision=1.1&view=markup
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: Don't allocate storage for
	  variables in bcmxcp.h  The header files should declare variables as
	  extern, and they should be allocated in only one .c file (not all
	  of the files which include the .h file). This was causing multiple
	  symbol definitions on Mac OS X.  Patch by Daniel Macks:
	  http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fink/experimental/dmacks/finkinfo/nut.patch?revision=1.1&view=markup

2012-02-16  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* data/driver.list.in, drivers/blazer_usb.c: Add support for Online

	  blazer_usb supported models (reported by Thomas Maisl)

2012-02-16  Charles Lepple <clepple+nut@gmail.com>

	* tools/git-svn.authors, tools/svn2cl.authors: Update SVN username
	  mappings

2012-02-14  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* data/driver.list.in: Add support for Tripp-Lite OMNISMART500  Add
	  Tripp-Lite OMNISMART500 (productID 0001) to the list of
	  tripplite_usb supported models (reported by Matt Schulte)

2012-02-10  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* data/driver.list.in: Support for Dell UPS Network Management Card
	  Add Dell UPS Network Management Card to the list of snmp-ups and
	  netxml-ups supported models. SNMP support currently relies on IETF
	  (RFC-1628) MIB, and not on Dell UPS MIB

2012-02-09  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_snmp.c: Remove useless lib_mutex and buggy
	  dev_mutex

2012-02-03  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* Makefile.am: Update ChangeLog generation and fix text wrapping
	  Adapt the ChangeLog file generation process to correctly wrap text,
	  even with the new 'git style' format, used for Subversion commit
	  messages

2012-02-02  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: Improve XCP support for battery
	  status  Add support for battery test publication in
	  ups.test.result, and RB (replace battery) in ups.status

2012-01-31  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/bestfortress.c: Add more debug traces  Add more debug
	  traces, again, to work on the checksum corruption issue

2012-01-23  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/mge-mib.c: Clean and complete MGE MIB  Complete MGE MIB for
	  status, variables and commands, using IETF MIB OIDs when needed.
	  Macro have also been replaced by actual numeric OID paths for
	  better clarity.
	* drivers/snmp-ups.c, drivers/snmp-ups.h: snmp-ups shutdown support
	  snmp-ups now provides support for UPS shutdown, based on usbhid-ups
	  mechanisms (composite commands and fallback). Composite commands
	  are also supported. This means, for example, that if
	  'shutdown.return' is not supported, a combination of 'load.off' +
	  'load.on' may be used.
	* drivers/ietf-mib.c: Fix invalid variable name  Beeper status
	  belongs to the 'ups' data collection
	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: Check validity of instant commands before
	  addition  Prior to adding new instant commands, referenced OIDs are
	  now checked for existance. This avoid adding commands that are not
	  supported
	* docs/man/upsmon.txt: Fix upsmon synopsis  Add the missing '-K'
	  (Test for the shutdown flag) to upsmon synopsis (reported by Regid
	  Ichira)

2012-01-20  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* data/driver.list.in: Support for Riello Netman Plus 102 SNMP Card
	  Add Riello Netman Plus 102 SNMP Card, and attached Sentinel SDL
	  6000-7 and Sentinel Dual SDH 1000-7 UPS, to the list of snmp-ups
	  supported models (reported by Rainer Stumbaum)

2012-01-19  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/bestfortress.c: Add more debug traces, to work on the
	  checksum corruption issue

2012-01-18  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* docs/nut-names.txt, drivers/usbhid-ups.c: Adjust ups.start.auto
	  value for shutdown commands  When present, ups.start.auto value
	  needs to be adjusted for shutdown.{return,stayoff} to behave as
	  expected. This is limited to Eaton devices (reported by Rich Wrenn)

2012-01-11  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* UPGRADING: Cleanup garbage line  Remove garbage line that was added
	  by accident during the AsciiDoc branch merge or work
	* tools/nut-scanner/Makefile.am, tools/nut-scanner/nutscan-init.c,
	  tools/nut-scanner/scan_nut.c: Move libupsclient to weak runtime
	  dependencies  libupsclient, as other libraries used by nut-scanner,
	  is now a weak runtime dependency, through the use of lt_dl*()
	  functions. This means that libupsclient is not anymore required,
	  but only suggested. This should also solve the distcheck-light
	  compilation on Aix (on behalf of Frédéric Bohe, from Eaton)

2012-01-10  Michal Hlavinka <mhlavink@redhat.com>

	* drivers/dstate.c: do not forget to check send_to_one return value
	  send_to_one free()s connection, we can't use it after failure.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: do not call getinfo twice, use returned value for
	  parsing  result was stored, but never used. Another dstate_getinfo
	  call was used instead of stored value. Probably result of
	  copy-paste.
	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_xml_http.c: do not use unterminated string
	  in strlen  recvfrom returns raw data without null termination, this
	  string can't be used in strlen. Use number of recieved bytes
	  returned by recvfrom instead of strlen.
	* clients/upssched.c: do not send garbage on retry  because write and
	  read commands shared one buffer, on retry we did not send command
	  again, but last read data
	* drivers/tripplite_usb.c: prevent buffer overflow in hexascdump
	  haxascdump uses fixed size static buffer, but it had no checks to
	  assure result can fit into that buffer.
	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_nut.c: ups variable was allocated, but not
	  free()d
	* drivers/rhino.c, drivers/solis.c: use automatic time_t variable
	  instead of allocated one  time_t value is small enough to be
	  automatic variable instead of allocated one. It eliminates risk we
	  forget to free it again.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: do not forget to free pTmp  even if len is zero,
	  pTmp should be freed
	* drivers/mge-utalk.c: prevent null pointer dereference in strchr  in
	  some cases p can be null causing null pointer dereference of v
	  (initialized to 0) in strchr command
	* drivers/bcmxcp_usb.c: Fix condition in re-try loop making error
	  checking unreachable  for loop with condition retry <= MAX_TRIES
	  ends with retry = MAX_TRIES+1. This breaks following error check
	  with retry == MAX_TRIES condition, because it's true only in case
	  when last retry actualy succeeded.

2012-01-09  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/bestups.c: Add the missing driver variable "battvoltmult"
	  (patch from Sadara Kael)

	* docs/download.txt: Remove inline SHA-256 sum, and provide links to
	  MD5 and SHA-256 sums

2012-01-05  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* server/netget.c: GET UPSDESC does not need device sanity checks
	  (i.e. connected, with fresh data) to answer  (reported by Emilien
	  Kia, Alioth bug #313323)
	* data/driver.list.in: Add Dynamix 1000VA USB to the list of
	  blazer_usb supported models  (requires "langid_fix=0x0409" in
	  ups.conf; reported by Glen Ogilvie)

2012-01-04  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* docs/download.txt: Add the missing SHA-256 sum on the Download page

	  (no monitoring) version of nut-ipmipsu, using older (pre 1.0.1)
	  FreeIPMI versions

2011-12-12  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

2011-10-25  Michal Soltys <msoltyspl-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: minor correction  Assigning 0 directly was

	  was removed) - ser_set_speed() prepares the port initially, we only
	  adjust certain options.

2011-09-12  Michal Soltys <msoltyspl-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/Makefile.am: apcsmart: minor Makefile.am change  Add
	  missing apcsmart_tabs.h
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: limit comm-lost spam  In
	  upsdrv_updateinfo(), additional comm-lost messages were logged,
	  potentially causing unnecessary spam in logs. As ser_comm_fail()
	  and ser_comm_good() functions do so themselves (including rate
	  limiting), we changed the superfluous info to debug level and also
	  switched to upsdebugx().
	* drivers/apcsmart.h: apcsmart: add '+' to APC_UNR_CMDS  Only '-' is
	  used, and only internally by the driver - no need to inform in logs
	  about unrecognized command.
	* docs/man/apcsmart.txt: apcsmart: minor updates to apcsmart man page

	  patch reverts the apcsmart back to relying on serial.c functions
	  for opening/closing and setting speed.  For the reference:
	  http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/nut-upsdev/2011-June/005491.html
	  If it turns out that re-opening serial ports during normal driver

	  override.<variable> in ups.conf are now really immutable.  They
	  can't be changed anymore (not even if they would have been R/W
	  otherwise). Rationale is, that if a user wants to override a value,
	  we should honor that request.  Added documentation accordingly (and
	  corrected previous commit).
	* docs/man/ups.conf.txt, drivers/dstate.c, drivers/main.c: Add
	  'ignorelb' flag to list of UPS fields in ups.conf...  ...to

	  early by setting this flag and battery.charge.low
	  (battery.runtime.low) in ups.conf.
	* data/driver.list.in: Removing subdriver setting  (cypress is auto
