(b) “Customer” means any third-party person or entity visiting or otherwise accessing Content on the World Wide Web via a HotSpot. 
(c) ”HotSpot” means each of the wireless access points operated by Affiliate during the term that serve as a gateway to the World Wide Web. 
(d) “Monetization Services” means AnchorFree’s proprietary method of monitoring, tracking and documenting Customer access to and use of Content through a HotSpot, which access and use is free of charge to the Customer but results in AnchorFree’s receipt of payment from providers of Content. 
(e) “Net Revenue” means amounts actually received by AnchorFree from third party providers of Content based on a Customer’s access and use of such Content. 

2. Configuration.In conjunction with this Agreement, Affiliate will either enter into the Equipment Loan and License Agreement or the Software License Agreement with AnchorFree to enable the Monetization Services. 

3. Other Requirements. Affiliate understands and agrees that its eligibility to utilize the Monetization Services with respect to any HotSpot shall continue only for so long as the connectivity to the World Wide Web through such HotSpot is provided free of charge to each Customer. Affiliate hereby represents, warrants and covenants that each HotSpot of Affiliate covered by this Agreement shall be solely for public access HotSpots that do not require payment or other consideration by a Customer to access the World Wide Web through such HotSpot. 

4. Fees and Payments.
4.1 Payments. You shall receive a payment related to the number of valid clicks on Ads, valid impressions of Ads, and/or valid completions of survey in connection with Your router, in each case as determined by AnchorFree for its participants in the Program. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing (including by electronic mail), payments to You shall be sent by AnchorFree within approximately thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month that Ads or Surveys are running on Your router if Your earned balance is $100 or more. In the event the Agreement is terminated, AnchorFree shall pay Your earned balance to You within approximately ninety (90) days after the end of the calendar month in which the Agreement is terminated by You (following AnchorFree's receipt of Your written request, including by email, to terminate the Agreement) or by AnchorFree. In no event, however, shall AnchorFree make payments for any earned balance less than $10. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, AnchorFree shall not be liable for any payment based on:
 
(a) any amounts which result from invalid display reporting, invalid Survey events, or invalid clicks or impressions on Ads generated by any person, bot, automated program or similar device, as reasonably determined by AnchorFree, including without limitation through any clicks or impressions 
(i) originating from Your IP addresses or computers under Your control, 
(ii) solicited by payment of money, false representation, or request for end users to click on Ads, or 
(iii) solicited by payment of money, false representation, or any illegal or otherwise invalid request for end users to complete Survey Events; 

(b) Ads or Surveys delivered to end users whose browsers have JavaScript disabled; 

(c) Ads benefiting charitable organizations and other placeholder or transparent Ads that AnchorFree may deliver; 

(d) AnchorFree advertisements for its own products and/or services (excluding payments based on completed Referral Events); or 
(e) clicks co-mingled with a significant number of invalid clicks described in (a) above, or as a result of any breach of this Agreement by You for any applicable pay period. 

AnchorFree reserves the right to withhold payment or charge back Your account due to any of the foregoing or any breach of this Agreement by You, pending AnchorFree's reasonable investigation of any of the foregoing or any breach of this Agreement by You, or in the event that an advertiser whose Ads are displayed in connection with Your Router(s) defaults on payment for such Ads to AnchorFree. In addition, if You are past due on any payment to AnchorFree in connection with any AnchorFree program, AnchorFree reserves the right to withhold payment until all outstanding payments have been made or to offset amounts owed to You in connection with the Program by amounts owed by You to AnchorFree. To ensure proper payment, You are solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with Your account. For U.S. taxpayers, this information includes withoutlimitation a valid U.S. tax identification number and a fully-completed Form W-9. For non-U.S. taxpayers, this information includes without limitation either a signed certification that the taxpayer does not have U.S. Activities or a fully-completed Form W-8 or other form, which may require a valid U.S. tax identification number, as required by the U.S. tax authorities. Any bank fees related to returned or cancelled checks due to a contact or payment information error or omission may be deducted from the newly issued payment. You agree to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with Your participation in the Program. AnchorFree may change its pricing and/or payment structure at any time. If You dispute any payment made under the Program, You must notify AnchorFree in writing within thirty (30) days of any such payment; failure to so notify AnchorFree shall result in the waiver by You of any claim relating to any such disputed payment. Payment shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by AnchorFree. No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by AnchorFree or have any effect under this Agreement. The payments made under this Agreement are for use by You only and may not be transferred or in any manner passed on to any third party (i.e., distributed to Routers managed by You that require separate payments) unless expressly authorized in writing by AnchorFree (including by electronic mail).

4.2 Taxes.  Each Party will be responsible for taxes based on its own net income, employment taxes with respect to its own employees, and for taxes on any property it owns or leases.

4.3 Expenses.  Each party will bear its own expenses in connection with the performance of this Agreement.  Except as specifically set forth above in this Section 4, neither party will owe any financial consideration to the other party under this Agreement.

(solely with respect to amounts owed but unpaid on the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement), 5.5, 6 and 7 will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.
(ii) Return of Materials.  No later than thirty (30) days after the date of expiration or termination of this Agreement, each party shall return, or if instructed by the other party, destroy, all information, documents, and materials exchanged between the parties (including all copies thereof) and each party shall furnish the other with a certificate signed by an executive officer of such party verifying that the same has been done.
(iii) Limitation of Liability.  In the event of termination by either
party in accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement, neither party will be liable to the other, because of such termination, for compensation, reimbursement or damages on account of the loss of prospective profits or anticipated sales or on account of expenditures, investments, or commitments in connection with the business or goodwill.

7. Miscellaneous.
No amendment or modification hereof shall be valid or binding upon the parties unless made in writing and signed by the duly authorized representatives of both parties.  In the event that any provision(s) of this Agreement shall be held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will continue in full force and effect without said provision and the parties will negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement to reflect the original intent of the parties.
