					To set up a static route between the router and another network:
					<ol class="wide">
						<li>Select a number from the Static Routing drop-down list.</li>
						<li>Enter the following data:
							<ul>
								<li>Destination IP Address &ndash; The Destination IP Address is the address of the network or host to which you want to assign a static route.</li>
								<li>Subnet Mask &ndash; The Subnet Mask determines which portion of an IP address is the network portion, and which portion is the host portion.</li>
								<li>Gateway &ndash; This is the IP address of the gateway device that allows for contact between the router and the network or host.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Depending on where the Destination IP Address is located, select <i>LAN &amp; WLAN</i> or <i>WAN</i> from the Interface drop-down menu. </li>
						<li>Click the <i>Apply</i> button to save your changes. To cancel your unsaved changes, click the <i>Cancel</i> button. For additional static routes, repeat steps 1-4.</li>
					</ol><br />
					To delete a static route entry:
					<ol class="wide">
						<li>From the Static Routing drop-down list, select the entry number of the static route.</li>
						<li>Click the <i>Delete This Entry</i> button.</li>

						<li>Gateway &ndash; This is the IP address of the gateway device that allows for contact between the router and the network or host.</li>
						<li>Interface &ndash; This interface tells you whether the Destination IP Address is on the LAN &amp; WLAN (internal wired and wireless networks), the WAN (Internet), or Loopback (a dummy network in which one PC acts like a network, necessary for certain software programs).</li>
