				<!--dd>The wireless part of your router can run in different modes:
					<ul class="wide">
						<li>AP mode &ndash; This is the default mode, also called Infrastructure mode. Your router acts as an central connection point, which wireless clients can connect to.</li>
						<li>Client mode &ndash; The radio interface is used to connect the internet-facing side of the router (i.e., the WAN) as a client to a remote accesspoint. NAT or routing are performed between WAN and LAN, like in "normal" gateway or router mode. Use this mode, e.g., if your internet connection is provided by a remote accesspoint, and you want to connect a subnet of your own to it. </li>
						<li>Client Bridged mode &ndash; The radio interface is used to connect the LAN side of the router to a remote accesspoint. The LAN and the remote AP will be in the same subnet (This is called a "bridge" between two network segments). The WAN side of the router is unused and can be disabled. Use this mode, e.g., to make the router act as a "WLAN adapter" for a device connected to one of its LAN ethernet ports.</li>
						<li>Ad-Hoc mode &ndash; This is for peer to peer wireless connections. Clients running in Ad-Hoc mode can connect to each other as required without involving central access points.</li>
