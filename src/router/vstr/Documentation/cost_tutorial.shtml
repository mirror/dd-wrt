    <h1>A tutorial of the costs of dealing with data using Vstr</h1>

<p> This page is an advanced tutorial looking at the costs of the different
Vstr calls, given different data.
For a <a href="tutorial">simpler starting tutorial see this page</a>. </p>


<h2>Adding data to a Vstr_base object</h2>

<p> There are four basic methods of adding data to a Vstr:  </p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="functions#vstr_add_buf()">vstr_add_buf</a>()</b>
</li>
<li><b><a href="functions#vstr_add_non()">vstr_add_non</a>()</b>
</li>
<li><b><a href="functions#vstr_add_ptr()">vstr_add_ptr</a>()</b>
</li>
<li><b><a href="functions#vstr_add_ref()">vstr_add_ref</a>()</b>
</li>
</ul>

<p> Each adds a specific type of node in the VSTR_TYPE_NODE prefix,
<a href="functions#vstr_add_buf()">vstr_add_buf</a> adding _BUF nodes
<a href="functions#vstr_add_ptr()">vstr_add_ptr</a> adding _PTR nodes etc.
 Nodes of different type cannot be merged, so if you have 512 byte sized _BUF
nodes and write code like...
</p>
<!--#exec cmd="ex_highlight cost_tut/add_buf_add_ptr.c"-->
<p>
...you will be wasting 508 bytes of space in each of the _BUF nodes. However, if
after the above you do...
</p>
<!--#exec cmd="ex_highlight cost_tut/pos_add_buf.c"-->

<p>...no extra _BUF node storage will have been allocated, as it's used some
of the spare storage from the first _BUF no ... and so "only" 504 bytes are
wasted in the first node, and still 508 in the third (second _BUF) node.
</p>

<p>
 Note that there are many functions that are built on these four primatives,
from the simple like
<a href="functions#vstr_add_cstr_buf()">vstr_add_cstr_buf</a>() which just
automatically works out the length, to
<a href="functions#vstr_add_rep_chr()">vstr_add_rep_chr</a>() which works
"as though" you called
<a href="functions#vstr_add_buf()">vstr_add_buf</a>() after calling
memset() on a buffer, without having to double copy and then there are the
more complicated functions like
<a href="functions#vstr_add_iovec_buf_beg()">vstr_add_iovec_buf_beg</a>()
and
<a href="functions#vstr_add_iovec_buf_end()">vstr_add_iovec_buf_end</a>()
which work as though you called
<a href="functions#vstr_add_buf()">vstr_add_buf</a> but they use an iovec
scatter gather list.
</p>

<h2>Substituting data in a Vstr_base object</h2>

<p> Each of the addition functions has a coresponding substitution function
by ust replacing the _add_ name with _sub_: </p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="functions#vstr_sub_buf()">vstr_sub_buf</a>()</b>
</li>
<li><b><a href="functions#vstr_sub_non()">vstr_sub_non</a>()</b>
</li>
<li><b><a href="functions#vstr_sub_ptr()">vstr_sub_ptr</a>()</b>
</li>
<li><b><a href="functions#vstr_sub_ref()">vstr_sub_ref</a>()</b>
</li>
</ul>

<p> These functions can all be thought of as doing a delete, followed by the
coresponding add function. However they are much faster, in many conditions,
and they are
<a href="constants#VSTR_CNTL_CONF_GET_FLAG_ATOMIC_OPS">atomic</a>
by default. Specifically when substituting via.
<a href="functions#vstr_sub_buf()">vstr_sub_buf</a>() into a _BUF
node the original data is overwritten with the new data, note that _BUF is the
only writeable node all other nodes are read-only. And when using either
<a href="functions#vstr_sub_ptr()">vstr_sub_ptr</a>() or
<a href="functions#vstr_sub_ref()">vstr_sub_ref</a>() to replace an entire
node then the nodes are just swapped in place. For instance:
</p>

<h3> Adding data and then memcpy()ing over it with new data </h3>
<!--#exec cmd="ex_highlight cost_tut/add_buf_sub_buf.c"-->

<h3> Adding data and then swapping the node with new data </h3>
<!--#exec cmd="ex_highlight cost_tut/add_buf_sub_ptr.c"-->

<h3> Adding data and then swapping the contents of the node with new data </h3>
<!--#exec cmd="ex_highlight cost_tut/add_ptr_sub_ptr.c"-->



<h2>Moving data between Vstr_base objects</h2>

<p> There are five basic methods of moving data from one Vstr to another, the
first four of which need to be followed by a delete to remove the data from
the source. The last one, however, does this in one operation:  </p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="functions#vstr_add_vstr()">vstr_add_vstr</a>( ..., <a href="constants#VSTR_TYPE_ADD_DEF">VSTR_TYPE_ADD_DEF</a>)</b>:
 This is the generic way
to add data, doing the obvious of copying all nodes. Ie. _BUF in the source
 becomes copied _BUF data in the dfestination, _NON, _PTR and _REF data makes a
new node with the _NON length, the pointer or the reference. To move data the
data you'd need to delete it from the source afterwards.
</li>
<li><b><a href="functions#vstr_add_vstr()">vstr_add_vstr</a>( ..., <a href="constants#VSTR_TYPE_ADD_BUF_REF">VSTR_TYPE_ADD_BUF_REF</a>)</b>: This converts all _BUF
nodes to _REF nodes, in the source. Then works the same way as
VSTR_TYPE_ADD_DEF. This means that you have to use a _REF node and a Vstr_ref
for each _BUF node in the source, the custom allocation policies in the
Vstr_conf help here. However it also means that all data becomes read-only,
and any alterations will require more _BUF nodes to be allocated in the source
or destination. To move data the
data you'd need to delete it from the source afterwards.</li>
<li><b><a href="functions#vstr_add_vstr()">vstr_add_vstr</a>( ..., <a href="constants#VSTR_TYPE_ADD_BUF_PTR">VSTR_TYPE_ADD_BUF_PTR</a>)</b>: This is like
VSTR_TYPE_ADD_BUF_REF, except that _BUF nodes in the source stay _BUF nodes
(so alterations are unaffected there) and Vstr_ref nodes are not used.  However
it also means that the source should not be altered before the destination has
been deleted, or the data in the destination may be altered or even invalid
memory. </li>
<li><b><a href="functions#vstr_add_vstr()">vstr_add_vstr</a>( ..., <a href="constants#VSTR_TYPE_ADD_ALL_BUF">VSTR_TYPE_ADD_ALL_BUF</a>)</b>: This option converts
all _PTR and _REF nodes into _BUF nodes, by copying the data in them. </li>
<li><b><a href="functions#vstr_mov()">vstr_mov()</a></b>: This function tried to move the data from the
source to the destionation. This means that if you move <b>entire</b> nodes
of data, and you haven't deleted data from the begining of a _BUF node that is
at the begining of the Vstr (or aren't moving that node) and the node sizes for
_BUF nodes are identical (or if the Vstr knows you don't have any _BUF nodes
inside the source) <b>then</b> this operation will just be a few pointer
assingments to move any amount of data. Assuming that you don't have _BUF nodes
or that both _BUF sizes are identical, this function will try and get as close
as possible to just doing the pointer assingments. However the somewhat common
case of moving a partial amount of data from a single _BUF node requres copying
the data in the source so it is in three seperate _BUF nodes, and then moving
the middle node to the destination. This can often require copying more data
than if the simple <a href="functions#vstr_add_vstr()">vstr_add_vstr</a>( ..., <a href="constants#VSTR_TYPE_ADD_DEF">VSTR_TYPE_ADD_DEF</a>)
 had been used.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other methods can be built upon those foundations such as...
</p>

<!--#exec cmd="ex_highlight cost_tut/iter_mov_add_del.c"-->

<h2>Deleting data from a Vstr_base object</h2>

<p> There is only a single call to delete data from a Vstr,
 <a href="functions#vstr_del()">vstr_del()</a>, however it has different
speed characteristics depending on what it needs to delete. Much like
<a href="functions#vstr_mov()">vstr_mov()</a> the worst case is dealing
with data that doesn't go to the end of a _BUF node, with a single exception.
This requires a single memmove() of all the later data in the node to the start
of the deletion in that node. All node types can delete data from the end of
the node by just changing a variable, nodes can be entirely removed by changing
pointers (although removing pointers from the middle of the Vstr will destroy
the iovec cache -- but that shouldn't be a large hit). All nodes, apart from
_BUF, can delete data from the begining of the node ... <b>also</b> there is
an optimisation so that deleting from the begining of _BUF nodes located at
the begining of the Vstr requires only a "used" variable alteration
(this is a very common operation for IO, where you add at the end and delete
from the begining).
 </p>
 <p> Deleteing from the middle of a non _BUF node is a somewhat faster way of
doing a delete to the end of the node and then doing an add of the data at
the end of th node . That means that this kind of delete
<b>requires an allocation</b>, which is why
<a href="functions#vstr_del()">vstr_del()</a>
returns a SUCCESS or FAILURE. This also applies to _BUF nodes when the
<a href="constants#VSTR_CNTL_CONF_GET_FLAG_DEL_SPLIT">VSTR_CNTL_CONF_GET_FLAG_DEL_SPLIT</a>
attribute is set in the configuration.
