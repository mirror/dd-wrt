dnsmasq (2.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

   * Removed reload command from start script and moved force-reload
     to be equivalent to restart. This is needed to be policy compliant
     since SIHGUP doesn't cause dnsmasq to reload its configuration file,
     only the /etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf etc. (closes: #244208)

dnsmasq (2.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

   * Added Conflict with pdnsd (closes: #242731).
     Rationale: dnsmasq used to conflict with all the DNS servers
     in Debian, but that was removed because some people wished
     to run with dnsmasq listening on one interface and another DNS
     server listening on another interface. However AFAIK it is not
     possible to make pdnsd listen on a subset of a hosts interfaces,
     so there is no scenario where running pdnsd and dnsmasq on the same
     host would be useful, hence the conflict goes back.
   * Added note about the --bind-interfaces option to
     readme.Debian (closes: #241700)

dnsmasq (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

   * New upstream: This removes the ability to read the 
     the leases file of ISC DHCP and replaces it with a built-in 
     DHCP server. Apologies in advance for breaking backwards 
     compatibilty, but this replaces a bit of a hack (the ISC stuff)
     with a nicely engineered and much more apropriate solution.
     Wearing my upstream-maintainer hat, I want to lose the hack now,
     rather than have to support it into Sarge.
   * New upstream closes some bugs since they become 
     irrelevant. (closes: #197295)
   * Ensure that /var/run and /var/lib/misc exist.
   * Remove sed dependency, which was a mistake.
   * Remove extraneous "build" file. (closes: #226994)

   * Removed conflicts with other dns servers since it is now
     possible to control exactly where dnsmasq listens on multi-homed 
     hosts, making co-existance with another nameserver
