.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpppoe-wrapper\fR is a small SUID program which allows non-root users
to start and stop PPPoE links.  It operates as follows:

.TP
.B o
First, \fIlinkname\fR is sanity-checked.  Too-long names and names containing
illegal characters are rejected.

.TP
.B o
Second, \fBpppoe-wrapper\fR opens the file \fB/etc/ppp/rp-pppoe-gui/\fR\fIlinkname\fR for reading.  If that file does not contain the line:
.nf

		NONROOT=OK

.fi
then \fBpppoe-wrapper\fR fails.

.TP
.B o
Otherwise, \fBpppoe-wrapper\fR runs \fBadsl-start\fR, \fBadsl-stop\fR or
\fBadsl-status\fR with the above filename as its single argument.
