.SS Methods
.SS void Connect()
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Connects all profiles the remote device supports that can be connected
to and have been flagged as auto\-connectable. If only subset of profiles
is already connected it will try to connect currently disconnected ones.
.sp
If at least one profile was connected successfully this method will
indicate success.
.sp
For dual\-mode devices only one bearer is connected at time, the
conditions are in the following order:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Connect the disconnected bearer if already connected.
.UNINDENT
.sp
2. Connect first the bonded bearer. If no bearers are bonded or both
are skip and check latest seen bearer.
.sp
3. Connect last seen bearer, in case the timestamps are the same BR/EDR
takes precedence, or in case \fBPreferredBearer\fP has been set to a
specific bearer then that is used instead.

.SS void Disconnect()
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Disconnects all connected profiles and then terminates low\-level ACL
connection.
.sp
ACL connection will be terminated even if some profiles were not
disconnected properly e.g. due to misbehaving device.
.sp
This method can be also used to cancel a preceding Connect call before
a reply to it has been received.
.sp
For non\-trusted devices connected over LE bearer calling this method
will disable incoming connections until Connect method is called again.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Disconnects a specific profile of this device. The profile needs to be
registered client profile.
.sp
There is no connection tracking for a profile, so as long as the
profile is registered this will always succeed.

.SS void Pair()
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Connects to the remote device and initiate pairing procedure then
proceed with service discovery.
.sp
If the application has registered its own agent, then that specific
agent will be used. Otherwise it will use the default agent.
.sp
Only for applications like a pairing wizard it would make sense to have
its own agent. In almost all other cases the default agent will handle
this just fine.
.sp
In case there is no application agent and also no default agent present,
this method will fail.

.SS array{array{byte}} GetServiceRecords() [experimental]
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Returns all currently known BR/EDR service records for the device. Each
individual byte array represents a raw SDP record, as defined by the
Bluetooth Service Discovery Protocol specification.
.sp
This method is intended to be only used by compatibility layers like
Wine, that need to provide access to raw SDP records to support foreign
Bluetooth APIs. General applications should instead use the Profile API
for services\-related functionality.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS string AddressType [readonly]
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Bluetooth device Address Type. For dual\-mode and BR/EDR only devices
this defaults to \(dqpublic\(dq. Single mode LE devices may have either value.

If the \fBAlias\fP property is unset, it will reflect this value which
makes it more convenient.
