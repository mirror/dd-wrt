.SS Methods
.SS void Release()
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This method gets called when the service daemon unregisters the agent.
An agent can use it to do cleanup tasks. There is no need to unregister
the agent, because when this method gets called it has already been
unregistered.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS string RequestPinCode(object device)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This method gets called when the service daemon needs to get the passkey
for an authentication.
.sp
The return value should be a string of 1\-16 characters length. The
string can be alphanumeric.
.sp

.SS void DisplayPinCode(object device, string pincode)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This method gets called when the service daemon needs to display a
pincode for an authentication.
.sp
An empty reply should be returned. When the pincode needs no longer to
be displayed, the Cancel method of the agent will be called.
.sp
This is used during the pairing process of keyboards that don\(aqt support
Bluetooth 2.1 Secure Simple Pairing, in contrast to DisplayPasskey which
is used for those that do.
.sp
This method will only ever be called once since older keyboards do not
support typing notification.
.sp
Note that the PIN will always be a 6\-digit number, zero\-padded to 6
digits. This is for harmony with the later specification.

.SS void DisplayPasskey(object device, uint32 passkey, uint16 entered)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This method gets called when the service daemon needs to display a
passkey for an authentication.
.sp
The entered parameter indicates the number of already typed keys on the
remote side.
.sp
An empty reply should be returned. When the passkey needs no longer to
be displayed, the Cancel method of the agent will be called.
.sp
During the pairing process this method might be called multiple times to
update the entered value.
.sp
Note that the passkey will always be a 6\-digit number, so the display
should be zero\-padded at the start if the value contains less than 6
digits.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS void RequestConfirmation(object device, uint32 passkey)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This method gets called when the service daemon needs to confirm a
passkey for an authentication.
.sp
To confirm the value it should return an empty reply or an error in case
the passkey is invalid.
.sp
Note that the passkey will always be a 6\-digit number, so the display
should be zero\-padded at the start if the value contains less than 6
digits.

.SS void RequestAuthorization(object device)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This method gets called to request the user to authorize an incoming
pairing attempt which would in other circumstances trigger the
just\-works model, or when the user plugged in a device that implements
cable pairing. In the latter case, the device would not be connected to
the adapter via Bluetooth yet.
