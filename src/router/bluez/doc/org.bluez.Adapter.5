.SS Methods
.SS void StartDiscovery()
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Starts device discovery session which may include starting an inquiry
and/or scanning procedures and remote device name resolving.
.sp
Use \fBStopDiscovery\fP to release the sessions acquired.
.sp
This process will start creating Device objects as new devices are
discovered.
.sp
During discovery RSSI delta\-threshold is imposed.
.sp
Each client can request a single device discovery session per adapter.
.sp
Possible errors:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS void StopDiscovery()
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Stops device discovery session started by \fBStartDiscovery\fP\&.
.sp
Note that a discovery procedure is shared between all discovery sessions
thus calling StopDiscovery will only release a single session and
discovery will stop when all sessions from all clients have finished.

information such as bonding information.

.SS void SetDiscoveryFilter(dict filter)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Sets the device discovery filter for the caller. When this method is
called with no filter parameter, filter is removed.
.sp
Possible filter values:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B array{string} UUIDs
Filter by service UUIDs, empty means match \fIany\fP UUID.
.sp
When a remote device is found that advertises any UUID from
UUIDs, it will be reported if:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPathloss\fP and \fBRSSI\fP are both empty.
.IP \(bu 2
only \fBPathloss\fP param is set, device advertise TX power, and
computed pathloss is less than Pathloss param.
.IP \(bu 2
only \fBRSSI\fP param is set, and received RSSI is higher
than RSSI param.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B int16 RSSI
RSSI threshold value.
.sp
PropertiesChanged signals will be emitted for already existing
Device objects, with updated RSSI value. If one or more
discovery filters have been set, the RSSI delta\-threshold, that
is imposed by StartDiscovery by default, will not be applied.
.TP
.B uint16 Pathloss
Pathloss threshold value.
.sp
PropertiesChanged signals will be emitted for already existing
Device objects, with updated Pathloss value.
.TP
.B string Transport (Default \(dqauto\(dq)
Transport parameter determines the type of scan.
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \(dqauto\(dq
Interleaved scan, use LE, BREDR, or both, depending on
what\(aqs currently enabled.
.TP
.B \(dqbredr\(dq
BR/EDR inquiry only.
.TP
.B \(dqle\(dq
LE scan only.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B bool DuplicateData (Default true)
Disables duplicate detection of advertisement data.
.sp
When enabled PropertiesChanged signals will be generated for
either ManufacturerData and ServiceData everytime they are
discovered.
.TP
.B bool Discoverable (Default false)
Make adapter discoverable while discovering, if the adapter is
already discoverable setting this filter won\(aqt do anything.
.TP
.B string Pattern (Default none)
Discover devices where the pattern matches either the prefix of
the address or device name which is convenient way to limited
the number of device objects created during a discovery.
.sp
When set disregards device discoverable flags.
.sp
Note: The pattern matching is ignored if there are other client
that don\(aqt set any pattern as it work as a logical OR, also
setting empty string \(dq\(dq pattern will match any device found.
.sp
When discovery filter is set, Device objects will be created as
new devices with matching criteria are discovered regardless of
they are connectable or discoverable which enables listening to
non\-connectable and non\-discoverable devices.
.sp
When multiple clients call SetDiscoveryFilter, their filters are
internally merged, and notifications about new devices are sent
to all clients. Therefore, each client must check that device
updates actually match its filter.
.sp
When SetDiscoveryFilter is called multiple times by the same
client, last filter passed will be active for given client.
.sp
SetDiscoveryFilter can be called before StartDiscovery.
It is useful when client will create first discovery session,
to ensure that proper scan will be started right after call to
StartDiscovery.

.SS object ConnectDevice(dict properties) [experimental]
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
connects to device without need of performing General Discovery.
Connection mechanism is similar to Connect method on
\fBorg.bluez.Device1(5)\fP interface with exception that this method
returns success when physical connection is established and you can
specify bearer to connect with parameter. After this method returns,
services discovery will continue and any supported profile will be
connected. There is no need for calling Connect on Device1 after this
call. If connection was successful this method returns object path to
created device object or device that already exist.

.UNINDENT
.SS string AddressType [readonly]
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Bluetooth Address Type. For dual\-mode and BR/EDR only adapter this
defaults to \(dqpublic\(dq. Single mode LE adapters may have either value.
With privacy enabled this contains type of Identity Address and not
type of address used for connection.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS string Name [readonly]
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Bluetooth system name (pretty hostname).
.sp
This property is either a static system default or controlled by an
external daemon providing access to the pretty hostname configuration.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS string Alias [readwrite]
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Bluetooth friendly name. This value can be changed.
.sp
In case no alias is set, it will return the system provided name.
Setting an empty string as alias will convert it back to the system
provided name.
.sp
When resetting the alias with an empty string, the property will default
back to system name.
.sp
On a well configured system, this property never needs to be changed
since it defaults to the system name and provides the pretty hostname.
Only if the local name needs to be different from the pretty hostname,
this property should be used as last resort.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS uint32 Class [readonly]

.SS boolean Connectable [readwrite]
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Set an adapter to connectable or non\-connectable. This is a global
setting and should only be used by the settings application.
.sp
Setting this property to false will set the Discoverable property
of the adapter to false as well, which will not be reverted if
if Connectable is set back to true. If required, the application
will need to manually set Discoverable to true.
.sp
Note that this property only affects incoming connections.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS boolean Powered [readwrite]
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

unplugging of the adapter it will reset back to false.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS string PowerState [readonly, experimental]

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Switch an adapter to discoverable or non\-discoverable to either make it
visible or hide it. This is a global setting and should only be used by

If the DiscoverableTimeout is set to a non\-zero value then the system
will set this value back to false after the timer expired.
.sp
In case the adapter is switched off, setting this value will fail.
.sp
When changing the Powered property the new state of this property will
be updated via a PropertiesChanged signal.
