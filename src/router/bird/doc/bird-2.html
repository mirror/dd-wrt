<P>BIRD has one or more routing tables which may or may not be synchronized with
OS kernel and which may or may not be synchronized with each other (see the Pipe
protocol). Each routing table contains a list of known routes. Each route
consists of:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>network prefix this route is for (network address and prefix
length -- the number of bits forming the network part of the
address; also known as a netmask)</LI>
<LI>preference of this route</LI>
<LI>IP address of router which told us about this route</LI>
<LI>IP address of router we should forward the packets to using this
route</LI>
<LI>other attributes common to all routes</LI>
<LI>dynamic attributes defined by protocols which may or may not be
present (typically protocol metrics)</LI>
</UL>
<P>Routing table maintains multiple entries for a network, but at most one entry
for one network and one protocol. The entry with the highest preference is used
for routing (we will call such an entry the <I>selected route</I>). If there are
more entries with the same preference and they are from the same protocol, the
protocol decides (typically according to metrics). If they aren't, an internal
ordering is used to break the tie. You can get the list of route attributes in
the Route attributes section.
<P>
<P>Each protocol is connected to a routing table through two filters which can
accept, reject and modify the routes. An <I>export</I> filter checks routes passed
from the routing table to the protocol, an <I>import</I> filter checks routes in
the opposite direction. When the routing table gets a route from a protocol, it
recalculates the selected route and broadcasts it to all protocols connected to
the table. The protocols typically send the update to other routers in the
network. Note that although most protocols are interested in receiving just
selected routes, some protocols (e.g. the <CODE>Pipe</CODE> protocol) receive and
process all entries in routing tables (accepted by filters).
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="dsc-sorted"></A> Usually, a routing table just chooses a selected route
from a list of entries for one network. But if the <CODE>sorted</CODE> option is
activated, these lists of entries are kept completely sorted (according to
preference or some protocol-dependent metric). This is needed for some features
of some protocols (e.g. <CODE>secondary</CODE> option of BGP protocol, which allows to
accept not just a selected route, but the first route (in the sorted list) that
is accepted by filters), but it is incompatible with some other features (e.g.
<CODE>deterministic med</CODE> option of BGP protocol, which activates a way of choosing
selected route that cannot be described using comparison and ordering). Minor
advantage is that routes are shown sorted in <CODE>show route</CODE>, minor disadvantage
is that it is slightly more computationally expensive.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="bird.html#toc2.1">Graceful restart</A>
</H2>

<P>When BIRD is started after restart or crash, it repopulates routing tables in
an uncoordinated manner, like after clean start. This may be impractical in some
cases, because if the forwarding plane (i.e. kernel routing tables) remains
intact, then its synchronization with BIRD would temporarily disrupt packet
forwarding until protocols converge. Graceful restart is a mechanism that could
help with this issue. Generally, it works by starting protocols and letting them
repopulate routing tables while deferring route propagation until protocols
acknowledge their convergence. Note that graceful restart behavior have to be
configured for all relevant protocols and requires protocol-specific support
(currently implemented for Kernel and BGP protocols), it is activated for
particular boot by option <CODE>-R</CODE>.
