</H2>

<P>BIRD contains a simple programming language. (No, it can't yet read mail :-).
There are two objects in this language: filters and functions. Filters are
interpreted by BIRD core when a route is being passed between protocols and
routing tables. The filter language contains control structures such as if's and
switches, but it allows no loops. An example of a filter using many features can
be found in filter/test.conf.
<P>
<P>Filter gets the route, looks at its attributes and modifies some of them if
it wishes. At the end, it decides whether to pass the changed route through
(using <CODE>accept</CODE>) or whether to <CODE>reject</CODE> it. A simple filter looks like
this:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
filter not_too_far
int var;
{
        if defined( rip_metric ) then
                var = rip_metric;
        else {
                var = 1;
                rip_metric = 1;
        }
        if rip_metric &gt; 10 then
                reject "RIP metric is too big";
        else
                accept "ok";
}
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>As you can see, a filter has a header, a list of local variables, and a body.
The header consists of the <CODE>filter</CODE> keyword followed by a (unique) name of
filter. The list of local variables consists of <CODE><I>type name</I>;</CODE>
pairs where each pair defines one local variable. The body consists of <CODE>{ <I>statements</I> }</CODE>. Each <I>statement</I> is terminated by a <CODE>;</CODE>. You
can group several statements to a single compound statement by using braces
(<CODE>{ <I>statements</I> }</CODE>) which is useful if you want to make a bigger
block of code conditional.
<P>
<P>BIRD supports functions, so that you don't have to repeat the same blocks of
code over and over. Functions can have zero or more parameters and they can have
local variables. Recursion is not allowed. Function definitions look like this:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
function name ()
int local_variable;
{
        local_variable = 5;
}

function with_parameters (int parameter)
{
        print parameter;
}
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>Unlike in C, variables are declared after the <CODE>function</CODE> line, but before
the first <CODE>{</CODE>. You can't declare variables in nested blocks. Functions are
called like in C: <CODE>name(); with_parameters(5);</CODE>. Function may return
values using the <CODE>return <I>[expr]</I></CODE> command. Returning a value exits
from current function (this is similar to C).
<P>
<P>Filters are declared in a way similar to functions except they can't have
explicit parameters. They get a route table entry as an implicit parameter, it
is also passed automatically to any functions called. The filter must terminate
with either <CODE>accept</CODE> or <CODE>reject</CODE> statement. If there's a runtime error in
filter, the route is rejected.
<P>
<P>A nice trick to debug filters is to use <CODE>show route filter <I>name</I></CODE>
from the command line client. An example session might look like:

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="bird.html#toc5.2">Data types</A>
</H2>

<P>Each variable and each value has certain type. Booleans, integers and enums
are incompatible with each other (that is to prevent you from shooting in the
foot).
<P>
<DL>
<DT><CODE>bool</CODE><DD><P>This is a boolean type, it can have only two values, <CODE>true</CODE> and
<CODE>false</CODE>. Boolean is the only type you can use in <CODE>if</CODE> statements.
<P>
<DT><CODE>int</CODE><DD><P>This is a general integer type. It is an unsigned 32bit type; i.e., you
can expect it to store values from 0 to 4294967295. Overflows are not
checked. You can use <CODE>0x1234</CODE> syntax to write hexadecimal values.
<P>
<DT><CODE>pair</CODE><DD><P>This is a pair of two short integers. Each component can have values
from 0 to 65535. Literals of this type are written as <CODE>(1234,5678)</CODE>.
The same syntax can also be used to construct a pair from two arbitrary
integer expressions (for example <CODE>(1+2,a)</CODE>).
<P>
<DT><CODE>quad</CODE><DD><P>This is a dotted quad of numbers used to represent router IDs (and
others). Each component can have a value from 0 to 255. Literals of
this type are written like IPv4 addresses.
<P>
<DT><CODE>string</CODE><DD><P>This is a string of characters. There are no ways to modify strings in
filters. You can pass them between functions, assign them to variables
of type <CODE>string</CODE>, print such variables, use standard string
comparison operations (e.g. <CODE>=, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=</CODE>), but
you can't concatenate two strings. String literals are written as
<CODE>"This is a string constant"</CODE>. Additionaly matching <CODE>~</CODE>
operator could be used to match a string value against a shell pattern
(represented also as a string).
<P>
<DT><CODE>ip</CODE><DD><P>This type can hold a single IP address. Depending on the compile-time
configuration of BIRD you are using, it is either an IPv4 or IPv6
address. IP addresses are written in the standard notation
(<CODE>10.20.30.40</CODE> or <CODE>fec0:3:4::1</CODE>). You can apply special operator
<CODE>.mask(<I>num</I>)</CODE> on values of type ip. It masks out all but
first <CODE><I>num</I></CODE> bits from the IP address. So
<CODE>1.2.3.4.mask(8) = 1.0.0.0</CODE> is true.
<P>
<DT><CODE>prefix</CODE><DD><P>This type can hold a network prefix consisting of IP address and prefix
length. Prefix literals are written as <CODE><I>ipaddress</I>/<I>pxlen</I></CODE>,
or <CODE><I>ipaddress</I>/<I>netmask</I></CODE>. There are two special
operators on prefixes: <CODE>.ip</CODE> which extracts the IP address from the
pair, and <CODE>.len</CODE>, which separates prefix length from the pair.
So <CODE>1.2.0.0/16.pxlen = 16</CODE> is true.
<P>
<DT><CODE>ec</CODE><DD><P>This is a specialized type used to represent BGP extended community
values. It is essentially a 64bit value, literals of this type are
usually written as <CODE>(<I>kind</I>, <I>key</I>, <I>value</I>)</CODE>, where
<CODE>kind</CODE> is a kind of extended community (e.g. <CODE>rt</CODE> / <CODE>ro</CODE> for a
route target / route origin communities), the format and possible values
of <CODE>key</CODE> and <CODE>value</CODE> are usually integers, but it depends on the
used kind. Similarly to pairs, ECs can be constructed using expressions
for <CODE>key</CODE> and <CODE>value</CODE> parts, (e.g. <CODE>(ro, myas, 3*10)</CODE>, where
<CODE>myas</CODE> is an integer variable).
<P>
<DT><CODE>int|pair|quad|ip|prefix|ec|enum set</CODE><DD><P>Filters recognize four types of sets. Sets are similar to strings: you
can pass them around but you can't modify them. Literals of type <CODE>int
set</CODE> look like <CODE> [ 1, 2, 5..7 ]</CODE>. As you can see, both simple
values and ranges are permitted in sets.
<P>For pair sets, expressions like <CODE>(123,*)</CODE> can be used to denote
ranges (in that case <CODE>(123,0)..(123,65535)</CODE>). You can also use
<CODE>(123,5..100)</CODE> for range <CODE>(123,5)..(123,100)</CODE>. You can also use
<CODE>*</CODE> and <CODE>a..b</CODE> expressions in the first part of a pair, note that
such expressions are translated to a set of intervals, which may be
memory intensive. E.g. <CODE>(*,4..20)</CODE> is translated to <CODE>(0,4..20),
(1,4..20), (2,4..20), ... (65535, 4..20)</CODE>.
<P>EC sets use similar expressions like pair sets, e.g. <CODE>(rt, 123,
10..20)</CODE> or <CODE>(ro, 123, *)</CODE>. Expressions requiring the translation
(like <CODE>(rt, *, 3)</CODE>) are not allowed (as they usually have 4B range
for ASNs).
<P>You can also use expressions for int, pair and EC set values. However it
must be possible to evaluate these expressions before daemon boots. So
you can use only constants inside them. E.g.
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
         define one=1;
         define myas=64500;
         int set odds;
         pair set ps;
         ec set es;

         odds = [ one, 2+1, 6-one, 2*2*2-1, 9, 11 ];
         ps = [ (1,one+one), (3,4)..(4,8), (5,*), (6,3..6), (7..9,*) ];
         es = [ (rt, myas, 3*10), (rt, myas+one, 0..16*16*16-1), (ro, myas+2, *) ];
        
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Sets of prefixes are special: their literals does not allow ranges, but
allows prefix patterns that are written
as <CODE><I>ipaddress</I>/<I>pxlen</I>{<I>low</I>,<I>high</I>}</CODE>.
Prefix <CODE><I>ip1</I>/<I>len1</I></CODE> matches prefix
pattern <CODE><I>ip2</I>/<I>len2</I>{<I>l</I>,<I>h</I>}</CODE> if the
first <CODE>min(len1, len2)</CODE> bits of <CODE>ip1</CODE> and <CODE>ip2</CODE> are
identical and <CODE>len1 &lt;= ip1 &lt;= len2</CODE>. A valid prefix pattern
has to satisfy <CODE>low &lt;= high</CODE>, but <CODE>pxlen</CODE> is not
constrained by <CODE>low</CODE> or <CODE>high</CODE>. Obviously, a prefix matches a
prefix set literal if it matches any prefix pattern in the prefix set
literal.
<P>There are also two shorthands for prefix patterns: <CODE><I>address</I>/<I>len</I>+</CODE>
is a shorthand for <CODE><I>address</I>/<I>len</I>{<I>len</I>,<I>maxlen</I>}</CODE>
(where <CODE><I>maxlen</I></CODE> is 32 for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6), that means
network prefix <CODE><I>address</I>/<I>len</I></CODE> and all its       subnets.
<CODE><I>address</I>/<I>len</I>-</CODE> is a shorthand for
<CODE><I>address</I>/<I>len</I>{0,<I>len</I>}</CODE>, that means network prefix
<CODE><I>address</I>/<I>len</I></CODE> and all its supernets (network prefixes
that contain it).
<P>For example, <CODE>[ 1.0.0.0/8, 2.0.0.0/8+, 3.0.0.0/8-, 4.0.0.0/8{16,24}
]</CODE> matches prefix <CODE>1.0.0.0/8</CODE>, all subprefixes of
<CODE>2.0.0.0/8</CODE>, all superprefixes of <CODE>3.0.0.0/8</CODE> and prefixes
<CODE>4.X.X.X</CODE> whose prefix length is 16 to 24. <CODE>[ 0.0.0.0/0{20,24} ]</CODE>
matches all prefixes (regardless of IP address) whose prefix length is
20 to 24, <CODE>[ 1.2.3.4/32- ]</CODE> matches any prefix that contains IP
address <CODE>1.2.3.4</CODE>. <CODE>1.2.0.0/16 ~ [ 1.0.0.0/8{15,17} ]</CODE>
is true, but <CODE>1.0.0.0/16 ~ [ 1.0.0.0/8- ]</CODE> is false.
<P>Cisco-style patterns like <CODE>10.0.0.0/8 ge 16 le 24</CODE> can be expressed
in BIRD as <CODE>10.0.0.0/8{16,24}</CODE>, <CODE>192.168.0.0/16 le 24</CODE> as 
<CODE>192.168.0.0/16{16,24}</CODE> and <CODE>192.168.0.0/16 ge 24</CODE> as
<CODE>192.168.0.0/16{24,32}</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>enum</CODE><DD><P>Enumeration types are fixed sets of possibilities. You can't define your
own variables of such type, but some route attributes are of enumeration
type. Enumeration types are incompatible with each other.
<P>
<DT><CODE>bgppath</CODE><DD><P>BGP path is a list of autonomous system numbers. You can't write
literals of this type. There are several special operators on bgppaths:
<P><CODE><I>P</I>.first</CODE> returns the first ASN (the neighbor ASN) in path <I>P</I>.
<P><CODE><I>P</I>.last</CODE> returns the last ASN (the source ASN) in path <I>P</I>.
<P>Both <CODE>first</CODE> and <CODE>last</CODE> return zero if there is no appropriate
ASN, for example if the path contains an AS set element as the first (or
the last) part.
<P><CODE><I>P</I>.len</CODE> returns the length of path <I>P</I>.
<P><CODE>prepend(<I>P</I>,<I>A</I>)</CODE> prepends ASN <I>A</I> to path <I>P</I> and
returns the result.
<P><CODE>delete(<I>P</I>,<I>A</I>)</CODE> deletes all instances of ASN <I>A</I> from
from path <I>P</I> and returns the result. <I>A</I> may also be an integer
set, in that case the operator deletes all ASNs from path <I>P</I> that are
also members of set <I>A</I>.
<P><CODE>filter(<I>P</I>,<I>A</I>)</CODE> deletes all ASNs from path <I>P</I> that are
not members of integer set <I>A</I>. I.e., <CODE>filter</CODE> do the same as
<CODE>delete</CODE> with inverted set <I>A</I>.
<P>Statement <CODE><I>P</I> = prepend(<I>P</I>, <I>A</I>);</CODE> can be shortened to
<CODE><I>P</I>.prepend(<I>A</I>);</CODE> if <I>P</I> is appropriate route attribute
(for example <CODE>bgp_path</CODE>). Similarly for <CODE>delete</CODE> and <CODE>filter</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>bgpmask</CODE><DD><P>BGP masks are patterns used for BGP path matching (using <CODE>path
~ [= 2 3 5 * =]</CODE> syntax). The masks resemble wildcard patterns
as used by UNIX shells. Autonomous system numbers match themselves,
<CODE>*</CODE> matches any (even empty) sequence of arbitrary AS numbers and
<CODE>?</CODE> matches one arbitrary AS number. For example, if <CODE>bgp_path</CODE> 
is 4 3 2 1, then: <CODE>bgp_path ~ [= * 4 3 * =]</CODE> is true,
but <CODE>bgp_path ~ [= * 4 5 * =]</CODE> is false. BGP mask
expressions can also contain integer expressions enclosed in parenthesis
and integer variables, for example <CODE>[= * 4 (1+2) a =]</CODE>. There is
also old syntax that uses / .. / instead of [= .. =] and ? instead of *.
<P>
<DT><CODE>clist</CODE><DD><P>Clist is similar to a set, except that unlike other sets, it can be
modified. The type is used for community list (a set of pairs) and for
cluster list (a set of quads). There exist no literals of this type.
There are three special operators on clists:
<P><CODE><I>C</I>.len</CODE> returns the length of clist <I>C</I>.
<P><CODE>add(<I>C</I>,<I>P</I>)</CODE> adds pair (or quad) <I>P</I> to clist <I>C</I> and
returns the result. If item <I>P</I> is already in clist <I>C</I>, it does
nothing. <I>P</I> may also be a clist, in that case all its members are
added; i.e., it works as clist union.
<P><CODE>delete(<I>C</I>,<I>P</I>)</CODE> deletes pair (or quad) <I>P</I> from clist
<I>C</I> and returns the result. If clist <I>C</I> does not contain item
<I>P</I>, it does nothing. <I>P</I> may also be a pair (or quad) set, in that
case the operator deletes all items from clist <I>C</I> that are also
members of set <I>P</I>. Moreover, <I>P</I> may also be a clist, which works
analogously; i.e., it works as clist difference.
<P><CODE>filter(<I>C</I>,<I>P</I>)</CODE> deletes all items from clist <I>C</I> that are
not members of pair (or quad) set <I>P</I>. I.e., <CODE>filter</CODE> do the same
as <CODE>delete</CODE> with inverted set <I>P</I>. <I>P</I> may also be a clist, which
works analogously; i.e., it works as clist intersection.
<P>Statement <CODE><I>C</I> = add(<I>C</I>, <I>P</I>);</CODE> can be shortened to
<CODE><I>C</I>.add(<I>P</I>);</CODE> if <I>C</I> is appropriate route attribute (for
example <CODE>bgp_community</CODE>). Similarly for <CODE>delete</CODE> and <CODE>filter</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>eclist</CODE><DD><P>Eclist is a data type used for BGP extended community lists. Eclists
are very similar to clists, but they are sets of ECs instead of pairs.
The same operations (like <CODE>add</CODE>, <CODE>delete</CODE>, or <CODE>~</CODE>
membership operator) can be used to modify or test eclists, with ECs
instead of pairs as arguments.
</DL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="bird.html#toc5.3">Operators</A>
</H2>

<P>The filter language supports common integer operators <CODE>(+,-,*,/)</CODE>,
parentheses <CODE>(a*(b+c))</CODE>, comparison <CODE>(a=b, a!=b, a&lt;b, a&gt;=b)</CODE>.
Logical operations include unary not (<CODE>!</CODE>), and (<CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE>) and or
(<CODE>||</CODE>). Special operators include <CODE>~</CODE> for "is element
of a set" operation - it can be used on element and set of elements of the same
type (returning true if element is contained in the given set), or on two
strings (returning true if first string matches a shell-like pattern stored in
second string) or on IP and prefix (returning true if IP is within the range
defined by that prefix), or on prefix and prefix (returning true if first prefix
is more specific than second one) or on bgppath and bgpmask (returning true if
the path matches the mask) or on number and bgppath (returning true if the
number is in the path) or on bgppath and int (number) set (returning true if any
ASN from the path is in the set) or on pair/quad and clist (returning true if
the pair/quad is element of the clist) or on clist and pair/quad set (returning
true if there is an element of the clist that is also a member of the pair/quad
set).
<P>
<P>There is one operator related to ROA infrastructure - <CODE>roa_check()</CODE>. It
examines a ROA table and does RFC 6483 route origin validation for a given
network prefix. The basic usage is <CODE>roa_check(<I>table</I>)</CODE>, which checks
current route (which should be from BGP to have AS_PATH argument) in the
specified ROA table and returns ROA_UNKNOWN if there is no relevant ROA,
ROA_VALID if there is a matching ROA, or ROA_INVALID if there are some relevant
ROAs but none of them match. There is also an extended variant
<CODE>roa_check(<I>table</I>, <I>prefix</I>, <I>asn</I>)</CODE>, which allows to specify a
prefix and an ASN as arguments.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4</A> <A HREF="bird.html#toc5.4">Control structures</A>
</H2>

<P>Filters support two control structures: conditions and case switches. 
<P>
<P>Syntax of a condition is: <CODE>if <I>boolean expression</I> then <I>command1</I>;
else <I>command2</I>;</CODE> and you can use <CODE>{ <I>command_1</I>; <I>command_2</I>;
<I>...</I> }</CODE> instead of either command. The <CODE>else</CODE> clause may be
omitted. If the <CODE><I>boolean expression</I></CODE> is true, <I>command1</I> is
executed, otherwise <I>command2</I> is executed.
<P>
<P>The <CODE>case</CODE> is similar to case from Pascal. Syntax is <CODE>case
<I>expr</I> { else: | <I>num_or_prefix [ .. num_or_prefix]</I>: <I>statement</I> ; [
... ] }</CODE>. The expression after <CODE>case</CODE> can be of any type which can be
on the left side of the ~ operator and anything that could be a member of
a set is allowed before <CODE>:</CODE>. Multiple commands are allowed without <CODE>{}</CODE>
grouping. If <CODE><I>expr</I></CODE> matches one of the <CODE>:</CODE> clauses, statements
between it and next <CODE>:</CODE> statement are executed. If <CODE><I>expr</I></CODE> matches
neither of the <CODE>:</CODE> clauses, the statements after <CODE>else:</CODE> are executed.
<P>
<P>Here is example that uses <CODE>if</CODE> and <CODE>case</CODE> structures:

<HR>
<PRE>
case arg1 {
        2: print "two"; print "I can do more commands without {}";

</H2>

<P>A filter is implicitly passed a route, and it can access its attributes just
like it accesses variables. Attempts to access undefined attribute result in a
runtime error; you can check if an attribute is defined by using the

returned with ICMP host unreachable / ICMP administratively prohibited
messages). Can be changed, but only to <CODE>RTD_BLACKHOLE</CODE>,

<DT><CODE><I>string</I> ifname</CODE><DD><P>Name of the outgoing interface. Sink routes (like blackhole, unreachable
or prohibit) and multipath routes have no interface associated with
them, so <CODE>ifname</CODE> returns an empty string for such routes. Read-only.
<P>
<DT><CODE><I>int</I> ifindex</CODE><DD><P>Index of the outgoing interface. System wide index of the interface. May
be used for interface matching, however indexes might change on interface
creation/removal. Zero is returned for routes with undefined outgoing
interfaces. Read-only.
<P>
<DT><CODE><I>int</I> igp_metric</CODE><DD><P>The optional attribute that can be used to specify a distance to the
network for routes that do not have a native protocol metric attribute
(like <CODE>ospf_metric1</CODE> for OSPF routes). It is used mainly by BGP to
compare internal distances to boundary routers (see below). It is also
used when the route is exported to OSPF as a default value for OSPF type
1 metric.
