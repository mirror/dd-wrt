</H2>

<P>
<P>The BGP protocol is implemented in three parts: <CODE>bgp.c</CODE> which takes care of the
connection and most of the interface with BIRD core, <CODE>packets.c</CODE> handling
both incoming and outgoing BGP packets and <CODE>attrs.c</CODE> containing functions for
manipulation with BGP attribute lists.
<P>As opposed to the other existing routing daemons, BIRD has a sophisticated core
architecture which is able to keep all the information needed by BGP in the
primary routing table, therefore no complex data structures like a central
BGP table are needed. This increases memory footprint of a BGP router with
many connections, but not too much and, which is more important, it makes
BGP much easier to implement.
<P>Each instance of BGP (corresponding to a single BGP peer) is described by a <I>bgp_proto</I>
structure to which are attached individual connections represented by <I>bgp_connection</I>
(usually, there exists only one connection, but during BGP session setup, there
can be more of them). The connections are handled according to the BGP state machine
defined in the RFC with all the timers and all the parameters configurable.
<P>In incoming direction, we listen on the connection's socket and each time we receive
some input, we pass it to <B>bgp_rx()</B>. It decodes packet headers and the markers and
passes complete packets to <B>bgp_rx_packet()</B> which distributes the packet according
to its type.
<P>In outgoing direction, we gather all the routing updates and sort them to buckets
(<I>bgp_bucket</I>) according to their attributes (we keep a hash table for fast comparison
of <I>rta</I>'s and a <I>fib</I> which helps us to find if we already have another route for
the same destination queued for sending, so that we can replace it with the new one
immediately instead of sending both updates). There also exists a special bucket holding
all the route withdrawals which cannot be queued anywhere else as they don't have any
attributes. If we have any packet to send (due to either new routes or the connection
tracking code wanting to send a Open, Keepalive or Notification message), we call
<B>bgp_schedule_packet()</B> which sets the corresponding bit in a <B>packet_to_send</B>
bit field in <I>bgp_conn</I> and as soon as the transmit socket buffer becomes empty,
we call <B>bgp_fire_tx()</B>. It inspects state of all the packet type bits and calls
the corresponding <B>bgp_create_xx()</B> functions, eventually rescheduling the same packet
type if we have more data of the same type to send.
<P>The processing of attributes consists of two functions: <B>bgp_decode_attrs()</B> for checking
of the attribute blocks and translating them to the language of BIRD's extended attributes
and <B>bgp_encode_attrs()</B> which does the converse. Both functions are built around a
<B>bgp_attr_table</B> array describing all important characteristics of all known attributes.
Unknown transitive attributes are attached to the route as <I>EAF_TYPE_OPAQUE</I> byte streams.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="prog.html#toc5.2">Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The OSPF protocol is quite complicated and its complex implemenation is
split to many files. In <CODE>ospf.c</CODE>, you will find mainly the interface
for communication with the core (e.g., reconfiguration hooks, shutdown
and initialisation and so on). In <CODE>packet.c</CODE>, you will find various
functions for sending and receiving generic OSPF packets. There are
also routines for authentication and checksumming. File <CODE>iface.c</CODE> contains
the interface state machine and functions for allocation and deallocation of OSPF's
interface data structures. Source <CODE>neighbor.c</CODE> includes the neighbor state
machine and functions for election of Designated Router and Backup
Designated router. In <CODE>hello.c</CODE>, there are routines for sending
and receiving of hello packets as well as functions for maintaining
wait times and the inactivity timer. Files <CODE>lsreq.c</CODE>, <CODE>lsack.c</CODE>, <CODE>dbdes.c</CODE>
contain functions for sending and receiving of link-state requests,
link-state acknowledgements and database descriptions respectively.
In <CODE>lsupd.c</CODE>, there are functions for sending and receiving
of link-state updates and also the flooding algorithm. Source <CODE>topology.c</CODE> is
a place where routines for searching LSAs in the link-state database,
adding and deleting them reside, there also are functions for originating
of various types of LSAs (router LSA, net LSA, external LSA). File <CODE>rt.c</CODE>
contains routines for calculating the routing table. <CODE>lsalib.c</CODE> is a set
of various functions for working with the LSAs (endianity conversions,
calculation of checksum etc.).
<P>One instance of the protocol is able to hold LSA databases for
multiple OSPF areas, to exchange routing information between
multiple neighbors and to calculate the routing tables. The core
structure is <I>proto_ospf</I> to which multiple <I>ospf_area</I> and
<I>ospf_iface</I> structures are connected. <I>ospf_area</I> is also connected to
<I>top_hash_graph</I> which is a dynamic hashing structure that
describes the link-state database. It allows fast search, addition
and deletion. Each LSA is kept in two pieces: header and body. Both of them are
kept in the endianity of the CPU.
<P>In OSPFv2 specification, it is implied that there is one IP prefix
for each physical network/interface (unless it is an ptp link). But
in modern systems, there might be more independent IP prefixes
associated with an interface.  To handle this situation, we have
one <I>ospf_iface</I> for each active IP prefix (instead for each active
iface); This behaves like virtual interface for the purpose of OSPF.
If we receive packet, we associate it with a proper virtual interface
mainly according to its source address.
<P>OSPF keeps one socket per <I>ospf_iface</I>. This allows us (compared to
one socket approach) to evade problems with a limit of multicast
groups per socket and with sending multicast packets to appropriate
interface in a portable way. The socket is associated with
underlying physical iface and should not receive packets received
on other ifaces (unfortunately, this is not true on
BSD). Generally, one packet can be received by more sockets (for
example, if there are more <I>ospf_iface</I> on one physical iface),
therefore we explicitly filter received packets according to
src/dst IP address and received iface.
<P>Vlinks are implemented using particularly degenerate form of
<I>ospf_iface</I>, which has several exceptions: it does not have its
iface or socket (it copies these from 'parent' <I>ospf_iface</I>) and it
is present in iface list even when down (it is not freed in
<B>ospf_iface_down()</B>).
<P>The heart beat of ospf is <B>ospf_disp()</B>. It is called at regular intervals
(<I>proto_ospf</I>-&gt;tick). It is responsible for aging and flushing of LSAs in
the database, for routing table calculaction and it call <B>area_disp()</B> of every
ospf_area.
<P>The function <B>area_disp()</B> is
responsible for late originating of router LSA and network LSA
and for cleanup before routing table calculation process in
the area.
To every <I>ospf_iface</I>, we connect one or more
<I>ospf_neighbor</I>'s -- a structure containing many timers and queues
for building adjacency and for exchange of routing messages.
<P>BIRD's OSPF implementation respects RFC2328 in every detail, but
some of internal algorithms do differ. The RFC recommends making a snapshot
of the link-state database when a new adjacency is forming and sending
the database description packets based on the information in this 
snapshot. The database can be quite large in some networks, so
rather we walk through a <I>slist</I> structure which allows us to
continue even if the actual LSA we were working with is deleted. New
LSAs are added at the tail of this <I>slist</I>.
<P>We also don't keep a separate OSPF routing table, because the core
helps us by being able to recognize when a route is updated
to an identical one and it suppresses the update automatically.
Due to this, we can flush all the routes we've recalculated and
also those we've deleted to the core's routing table and the
core will take care of the rest. This simplifies the process
and conserves memory.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="prog.html#toc5.3">Pipe</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The Pipe protocol is very simple. It just connects to two routing tables
using <B>proto_add_announce_hook()</B> and whenever it receives a <B>rt_notify()</B>
about a change in one of the tables, it converts it to a <B>rte_update()</B>
in the other one.
<P>To avoid pipe loops, Pipe keeps a `being updated' flag in each routing
table.
<P>A pipe has two announce hooks, the first connected to the main
table, the second connected to the peer table. When a new route is
announced on the main table, it gets checked by an export filter in
ahook 1, and, after that, it is announced to the peer table via
<B>rte_update()</B>, an import filter in ahook 2 is called. When a new
route is announced in the peer table, an export filter in ahook2
and an import filter in ahook 1 are used. Oviously, there is no
need in filtering the same route twice, so both import filters are
set to accept, while user configured 'import' and 'export' filters
are used as export filters in ahooks 2 and 1. Route limits are
handled similarly, but on the import side of ahooks.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4</A> <A HREF="prog.html#toc5.4">Routing Information Protocol</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>RIP is a pretty simple protocol, so about a half of its code is interface
with the core.
<P>We maintain our own linked list of <I>rip_entry</I> structures -- it serves
as our small routing table. RIP never adds to this linked list upon
packet reception; instead, it lets the core know about data from the packet
and waits for the core to call <B>rip_rt_notify()</B>.
<P>Within <B>rip_tx()</B>, the list is
walked and a packet is generated using <B>rip_tx_prepare()</B>. This gets
tricky because we may need to send more than one packet to one
destination. Struct <I>rip_connection</I> is used to hold context information such as how
many of <I>rip_entry</I>'s we have already sent and it's also used to protect
against two concurrent sends to one destination. Each <I>rip_interface</I> has
at most one <I>rip_connection</I>.
<P>We are not going to honor requests for sending part of
routing table. That would need to turn split horizon off etc.  
<P>About triggered updates, RFC says: when a triggered update was sent,
don't send a new one for something between 1 and 5 seconds (and send one
after that). We do something else: each 5 seconds,
we look for any changed routes and broadcast them.

and in case an entry is too old, it is discarded.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5</A> <A HREF="prog.html#toc5.5">Router Advertisements</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The RAdv protocol is implemented in two files: <CODE>radv.c</CODE> containing
the interface with BIRD core and the protocol logic and <CODE>packets.c</CODE>
handling low level protocol stuff (RX, TX and packet formats).
The protocol does not import or export any routes.
<P>The RAdv is structured in the usual way - for each handled interface
there is a structure <I>radv_iface</I> that contains a state related to
that interface together with its resources (a socket, a timer).
There is also a prepared RA stored in a TX buffer of the socket
associated with an iface. These iface structures are created
and removed according to iface events from BIRD core handled by
<B>radv_if_notify()</B> callback.
<P>The main logic of RAdv consists of two functions:
<B>radv_iface_notify()</B>, which processes asynchronous events (specified
by RA_EV_* codes), and <B>radv_timer()</B>, which triggers sending RAs and
computes the next timeout.
<P>The RAdv protocol could receive routes (through
<B>radv_import_control()</B> and <B>radv_rt_notify()</B>), but only the
configured trigger route is tracked (in <I>active</I> var).  When a radv
protocol is reconfigured, the connected routing table is examined
(in <B>radv_check_active()</B>) to have proper <I>active</I> value in case of
the specified trigger prefix was changed.
<P>Supported standards:
- RFC 4861 - main RA standard
- RFC 6106 - DNS extensions (RDDNS, DNSSL)
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6</A> <A HREF="prog.html#toc5.6">Static</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The Static protocol is implemented in a straightforward way. It keeps
two lists of static routes: one containing interface routes and one
holding the remaining ones. Interface routes are inserted and removed according
to interface events received from the core via the <B>if_notify()</B> hook. Routes
pointing to a neighboring router use a sticky node in the neighbor cache
to be notified about gaining or losing the neighbor. Special
routes like black holes or rejects are inserted all the time.
<P>Multipath routes are tricky. Because these routes depends on
several neighbors we need to integrate that to the neighbor
notification handling, we use dummy static_route nodes, one for
each nexthop. Therefore, a multipath route consists of a master
static_route node (of dest RTD_MULTIPATH), which specifies prefix
and is used in most circumstances, and a list of dummy static_route
nodes (of dest RTD_NONE), which stores info about nexthops and are
connected to neighbor entries and neighbor notifications. Dummy
nodes are chained using mp_next, they aren't in other_routes list,
and abuse some fields (masklen, if_name) for other purposes.
<P>The only other thing worth mentioning is that when asked for reconfiguration,
Static not only compares the two configurations, but it also calculates
difference between the lists of static routes and it just inserts the
newly added routes and removes the obsolete ones.
