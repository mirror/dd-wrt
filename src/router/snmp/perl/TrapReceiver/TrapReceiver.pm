=head1 NAME

NetSNMP::TrapReceiver - Embedded perl trap handling for Net-SNMP's snmptrapd

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Put the following lines in your snmptrapd.conf file:

  perl NetSNMP::TrapReceiver::register("trapOID", \&myfunc);

=head1 ABSTRACT

The NetSNMP::TrapReceiver module is used to register perl
subroutines into the Net-SNMP snmptrapd process.  Net-SNMP MUST have
been configured using --enable-embedded-perl.  Registration of
functions is then done through the snmptrapd.conf configuration
file.  This module can NOT be used in a normal perl script to
receive traps.  It is intended solely for embedded use within the
snmptrapd demon.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Within the snmptrapd.conf file, the keyword "perl" may be used to call
any perl expression and using this ability, you can use the
NetSNMP::TrapReceiver module to register functions which will be
called every time a given notification (a trap or an inform) is
received.  Registered functions are called with 2 arguments.  The
first is a reference to a hash containing information about how the
trap was received (what version of the SNMP protocol was used, where
it came from, what SNMP user name or community name it was sent under,
etc).  The second argument is a reference to an array containing the
variable bindings (OID and value information) that define the
noification itself.  Each variable is itself a reference to an array
containing four values: a NetSNMP::OID object, a string representation
of the value that came associated with it, the value's numeric type (see
NetSNMP::ASN for further details on SNMP typing information), and the raw
value of the trap, encoded according to its type, 64-bit integer types are
returned as strings, integer types as integers, strings as strings, object
identifiers as NetSNMP::OID objects, and any other types as undefs.

Registered functions should return one of the following values:

=over 2

=item NETSNMPTRAPD_HANDLER_OK

Handling the trap succeeded, but lets the snmptrapd demon check for
further appropriate handlers.

=item NETSNMPTRAPD_HANDLER_FAIL

Handling the trap failed, but lets the snmptrapd demon check for
further appropriate handlers.

=item NETSNMPTRAPD_HANDLER_BREAK

Stops evaluating the list of handlers for this specific trap, but lets
the snmptrapd demon apply global handlers.

=item NETSNMPTRAPD_HANDLER_FINISH

Stops searching for further appropriate handlers.

=back

If a handler function does not return anything appropriate or even
nothing at all, a return value of NETSNMPTRAPD_HANDLER_OK is assumed.

Subroutines are registered using the NetSNMP::TrapReceiver::register
function, which takes two arguments.  The first is a string describing
the notification you want to register for (such as "linkUp" or
"MyMIB::MyTrap" or ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021....").  Two special keywords can
be used in place of an OID: "default" and "all".  The "default"
keyword indicates you want your handler to be called in the case where
no other handlers are called.  The "all" keyword indicates that the
handler should ALWAYS be called for every notification.


=head1 EXAMPLE

As an example, put the following code into a file (say
"/usr/local/share/snmp/mytrapd.pl"):

  #!/usr/bin/perl

  sub my_receiver {
      print "********** PERL RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION:\n";

      # print the PDU info (a hash reference)
      print "PDU INFO:\n";
      foreach my $k(keys(%{$_[0]})) {
        if ($k eq "securityEngineID" || $k eq "contextEngineID") {
          printf "  %-30s 0x%s\n", $k, unpack('h*', $_[0]{$k});
        }
        else {
          printf "  %-30s %s\n", $k, $_[0]{$k};
        }
      }

      # print the variable bindings:
      print "VARBINDS:\n";
      foreach my $x (@{$_[1]}) { 
	  printf "  %-30s type=%-2d value=%s\n", $x->[0], $x->[2], $x->[1]; 
      }
  }

  NetSNMP::TrapReceiver::register("all", \&my_receiver) || 
    warn "failed to register our perl trap handler\n";

  print STDERR "Loaded the example perl snmptrapd handler\n";

Then, put the following line in your snmprapd.conf file:

  perl do "/usr/local/share/snmp/mytrapd.pl";

Start snmptrapd (as root, and the following other opions make it stay
in the foreground and log to stderr):

  snmptrapd -f -Le

You should see it start up and display the final message from the end
of the above perl script:

  Loaded the perl snmptrapd handler
  2004-02-11 10:08:45 NET-SNMP version 5.2 Started.

Then, if you send yourself a fake trap using the following example command:

  snmptrap -v 2c -c mycommunity localhost 0 linkUp ifIndex.1 i 1 \
      ifAdminStatus.1 i up ifOperStatus.1 i up ifDescr s eth0

You should see the following output appear from snmptrapd as your perl
code gets executed:

  ********** PERL RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION:
  PDU INFO:
    notificationtype               TRAP
    receivedfrom                   127.0.0.1
    version                        1
    errorstatus                    0
    messageid                      0
    community                      mycommunity
    transactionid                  2
    errorindex                     0
    requestid                      765160220
  VARBINDS:
    sysUpTimeInstance              type=67 value=0:0:00:00.00
    snmpTrapOID.0                  type=6  value=linkUp
    ifIndex.1                      type=2  value=1
    ifAdminStatus.1                type=2  value=1
    ifOperStatus.1                 type=2  value=1
    ifDescr                        type=4  value="eth0"

=head2 Passing Arguments

If you need to pass arguments in to the script, you'll need to do it
by one of two methods:

=head3 Using Subroutines

You can either define a subroutine in the file rather than have
the file itself do something.  IE, in the file if you put:

  sub foo {
     print "$_[0]\n";
  }

and then put these lines in the snmptrapd.conf file:

  perl do /path/to/script
  perl foo("hello world");
  perl foo("now I am passing something different");

It'd call the foo function twice, and print the results to the console
where snmptrapd was started.

=head3 Using Variables

Or you could always set a variable ahead of time:

  perl $myVariable = 42;
  perl do /path/to/script

And have the script look for and use the $myVariable value in the script

=head1 EXPORT

None by default.

=head2 Exportable constants

  NETSNMPTRAPD_AUTH_HANDLER
  NETSNMPTRAPD_HANDLER_BREAK
  NETSNMPTRAPD_HANDLER_FAIL
  NETSNMPTRAPD_HANDLER_FINISH
  NETSNMPTRAPD_HANDLER_OK
  NETSNMPTRAPD_POST_HANDLER
  NETSNMPTRAPD_PRE_HANDLER
