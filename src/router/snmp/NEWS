that have been fixed/applied, and the ChangeLog file for a comprehensive
listing of all changes made to the code.

*5.9.3*:
    security:
      - These two CVEs can be exploited by a user with read-only credentials:
          - CVE-2022-24805 A buffer overflow in the handling of the INDEX of
            NET-SNMP-VACM-MIB can cause an out-of-bounds memory access.
          - CVE-2022-24809 A malformed OID in a GET-NEXT to the nsVacmAccessTable
            can cause a NULL pointer dereference.
      - These CVEs can be exploited by a user with read-write credentials:
          - CVE-2022-24806 Improper Input Validation when SETing malformed
            OIDs in master agent and subagent simultaneously
          - CVE-2022-24807 A malformed OID in a SET request to
            SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmAccessTable can cause an
            out-of-bounds memory access.
          - CVE-2022-24808 A malformed OID in a SET request to
            NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsLogTable can cause a NULL pointer dereference
          - CVE-2022-24810 A malformed OID in a SET to the nsVacmAccessTable
            can cause a NULL pointer dereference.
      - To avoid these flaws, use strong SNMPv3 credentials and do not share them.
        If you must use SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, use a complex community string
        and enhance the protection by restricting access to a given IP address range.
      - Thanks are due to Yu Zhang of VARAS@IIE and Nanyu Zhong of VARAS@IIE for
        reporting the following CVEs that have been fixed in this release, and
        to Arista Networks for providing fixes.

    misc:
      - Snmp-create-v3-user: Fix the snmpd.conf path   @datadir@ is
	expanded in ${datarootdir} so datarootdir must be set before
	@datadir@ is used.

	snmptranslate to enter bulk translation mode, in which it expects
	one OID per line.  Whitespace is treated as the end of the OID, and
	only that portion of the line is replaced, meaning that this can be
	used to translate, e.g., "snmpwalk" output without the proper MIBs
	loaded: snmptranslate -m all -OX < numeric.txt > symbolic.txt

    building:

      - Patch 2525: from Ryan Steinmetz: Fix argument length parsing of the
	host resources mib
      - Make ENV_SEPARATOR_CHAR configurable
      - SECURITY: a denial of service attack vector was discovered on
        the linux implementation of the ICMP-MIB.  This release fixes
        this bug and all users are encouraged to update their SNMP
        agent if they make use of the ICMP-MIB table objects.

    perl:
      - BUG: 2402: Add support for SNMPv3 traps

    Windows:
      - Port batch build infrastructure to Visual Studio 2010 and later
	From Visual Studio 2010 on it is no longer possible to specify
	include or library directories globally - these have to be
	specified per project. Hence two additional menu entries in
	build.bat that allow to specify these directories.
      - Patch from Bart Van Assche to improve cygwin building

        - E.G. dtlsudp: auto-sets the SNMP version and the security model.
      - [PATCH 2942940]: Add a new function, netsnmp_parse_args, that is
	like snmp_parse_args but takes an additional bitmask, flags, to
	affect the behaviour. Also remove the magic handling of some
	application names.
      - A new X.509 certificate API for indexing and reading certificates
      - new experimental row creation API which uses a state machine
        to try really hard to create a row from a given varbind list
      - netsnmp_container enhancements:
        - added a free_item function
        - added a CONTAINER_FREE_ALL macro/function
        - added an interface for duplicating a container (CONTAINER_DUP)
        - added a remove function to container_iterators
	- added an ability to set options on binary_array containers
      - new snmp token logOption allows specifying log destinations
        via configuration conf files
      - A very significant reduction in compiler warning output

*5.4*

  Important Changes:
    - The default configuration now enables embedded Perl and the Perl
      modules by default when possible unless explicitly disabled. You
      may use the --disable-embedded-perl and --without-perl-modules
      configure options, respectively, to revert to the former default
      configuration.

  New:
    python:
      - Python bindings to the Net-SNMP project are now available in
        the python sub-directory.  See the README file there for details. 

    build:
      - Some preliminary support for automatic building of dynamically
        loadable mib module code.
      - Most net-snmp specific defines are now (also) available under
        a proper NETSNMP_ prefix. The older, potentially conflicting
        names as well as the autoconf variables can now be turned off
        easily within 3rd party code.
      - libtool update to 1.5.22
      - enable-as-needed will try to link built libraries against needed
	libraries at library link time, rather than application link time.
        This is preliminary support for what will likely be better in 5.5.

    snmplib:
      - [PATCH 1282566]: to rework transport creation to allow for
        alternative interpretations of the address and a more flexible
        transport registration system
      - [PATCH 1509943]: responses will get sent from the original dest IP
        address when possible.

    snmpd:
      - new MIB table for managing Net-SNMP access control extensions
        (see NET-SNMP-VACM-MIB).  These extensions to the VACM MIB are
        Net-SNMP specific and are used primarily by snmptrapd at this point.
      - [PATCH 1550725]: A new uint instance helper to match the existing
        int, long and ulong helpers
      - [PATCH 1534877]: to add support for skipping NFS entries in the
        host resources hrStorageTable.	See the skipNFSInHostResources
        token in the snmpd.conf file for details.
      - A "hardware abstraction layer", to localise the O/S-specific
        aspects of retrieving system data.  This first appeared in the
        5.3.x line, but this release now starts to actively use it for
        implementing particular MIB modules.
        This has resulted in some minor changes in behaviour - some index
        values in the hrStorageTable have changed from earlier releases,
        and the (non-raw) memory statistics are now consistent, reporting
        percentage usage calculated over the last minute on _all_ systems.
      - Agent builds default module list from a default_mibs.h rather than
        a hard coded configure list
      - [PATCH 1568150]: Extend pass_persist error messages that can be
	passed back from the script
      - [PATCH 1570982]: Solaris IF-MIB: Support for IPv6-only interfaces

    snmptrapd:
      - the traphandle directive now supports a -t switch to indicate
        matching any OID in the tree below the specified OID

    mib2c:
      - New mib2c.emulation.conf provides a quick way to do simplistic
        emulation of an entire MIB or MIB branch.

*5.3.0.1*

  *** Security Fix ***

    - In version 5.3 much of the authorization control was rewritten.
      There was a bug in the new code that resulted in granting write
      access to read-only users or communities which were configured
      using the "rocommunity" or "rouser" snmpd.conf tokens.  5.3.0.1
      fixes this problem.  Users are encouraged to immediately update
      their installations if they use either of these tokens.


*5.3*

 *** Important Notes ***

    Several very significant changes have been made in Net-SNMP for this
    release that warrant special attention.

    - shared library version number no longer matches the release number. We
      now follow the versioning scheme recommended by libtool. For the 5.3
      release this means that the libraries now have a SONAME ending with
      ".so.10", e.g. libnetsnmp.so.10.

    - snmpd has not been truncating log files at startup, as documented in
      the man pages, for a while now. This default behaviour has been restored.
      Please use the '-A' flag if you want to continue appending to your log
      files at startup.

    - snmptrapd will no longer accept all traps by default. It must be
      configured with authorized SNMPv1/v2c community strings and/or SNMPv3
      users. Non-authorized traps/informs will be dropped.

    - Due to a copyright statement that didn't allow modifications, 
      snmpnetstat has been completely rewritten.  The new version now
      accepts the same command-line options as the other tools, which
      has introduced a number of incompatible changes.  However, it
      does now finally support SNMPv3.

 New:
    Building:
      - new option to disable set support in the agent (--disable-set-support)

   snmpd:
     - implement notification logging
     - implement notification filtering
     - AgentX, host resources and disman/event mibs added to default module list
     - updated and new disman mib implementations

   snmptrapd:
     - allow a non-default AgentX socket
     - a brand new authorization scheme that is based on the VACM
       authorization scheme from snmpd.
       - Note: now drops unauthenticated notifications by default
     - registers the snmpEngine MIB group under the "snmptrapd" context

   snmplib:
     - new helper for ascii file based scalar integers (think Linux /proc/)
     - new utilities for dealing with files
     - new utilities for parsing text files
     - granular config/persistent file disablement (noPersistentLoad and
       noPersistentSave snmp.conf tokens)

    mib2c:
      - mib2c.mfd.conf now generates code for persistence row storage
      - many enhancements and bug fixes

    snmpusm:
      - allows to use old and/or new localized key instead of passphrase with
        option -Ck
      - new option -CE to specify usmUserEngineID (necessary to manage
        snmptrapd's usmUserTable)

 Ports:
   Linux:
       - new experimental tables
         - tcpConnectionTable, tcpListenerTable
         - ipAddressPrefixTable
         - udpEndpointTable
         - ipv4InterfaceTable, ipv6InterfaceTable
       - inetCidrRouteTable supports dynamic ipv4 route creation/deletion
       - added ipv6IpForwarding.0 and ipv6IpDefaultHopLimit.0 (read-write)

   Win32:
     - Cygwin compiler fixes
     - MSVC: agent (snmpd) support for pass and pass_persist
     - MinGW: agent (snmpd) support for pass
     - Fix for 'select: No such file or directory' in snmpdelta

 Fixes:
   - Persistent files in directory defined by snmp.conf persistentDir were 
     not being loaded at startup
   - Perl getnext didn't honor explicit reference to MIB file
   - AgentX sub-agent connection delayed til after config files read
   - Build fixes for --disable-agent, --disable-snmpv1 and --disable-snmpv2c
   - Lots of bug fixes


*5.2*
 New:
    For the security paranoid (like Wes):
      - Insecure versions of SNMP may be completely disabled at compile time.
          (configure using one or both of --disable-snmpv1 --disable-snmpv2c)
      - Less secure versions of SNMPv3 authentication and encryption
          algorithms may be completely disabled at compile time.
          (configure using one or both of --disable-des --disable-md5)
          (This requires you have OpenSSL to support SHA1 and AES instead)
      - Diffie-Helman key negotiation (perfect-forward-secrecy - RFC2786)
          has been implemented in both the agent and "snmpusm".
      - Better support for direct use of localized and master keys
        (randomly generated keys have more entropy than passwords). See
        the -3m -3M -3k and -3K options, and the defAuthLocalizedKey,
        defPrivLocalizedKey, defAuthMasterKey, defPrivMasterKey
        snmp.conf tokens)

    library:
      - send and receive buffer sizes for UDP/TCP are configurable
      - .conf file token registration can now search multiple files
        (separate file names to search by a :.  IE, "snmpd:agentx")

    snmptrapd:
      - Embedded perl support for trap handlers (much faster than traphandles).
          (configure --with-embedded-perl ; see 'perldoc NetSNMP::TrapReceiver')
      - the snmptrapd usmUser table can be controlled through SNMP & AgentX
          (the snmptrapd registers MIBs under the "snmptrapd" SNMPv3 context)

    agent:
      - community strings can be mapped to individual SNMPv3 contexts
          (see the snmpd.conf manual on "com2sec").
      - AgentX should work properly with SNMPv3 contexts now.
      - improved version of "exec" extension directive - "extend":
          supports multi-line output, configurable command input, SET
          handling, a valid relocatable MIB output structure, etc
      - more flexibility added to netsnmp_cache helper, including periodic
          refreshing of caches and cache pre-loading.
      - experimental implementation of DisMan Remote Operations MIB groups
        (remote nslookup, ping, traceroute and expressions via SNMP)
      - The proxy supports a new -Cc flag which passes the community
        name through to the other side rather than hard-coding it.
      - The config_require() and other modules can now be placed
        inside of CPP directievs (#if, /* ... */) as header files are
        now passed through CPP processing first.
      - new config_exclude() macro for excluding certain modules
      - new config_belongs_in() macro to specify if a chunk of code
        found by --with-mib-modules belongs in the agent library or
        the mib module library.
      - Uses a smaller function stack.

    commands:
      - snmpusm: A number of key-change improvements
        (EG, changing localized keys supported, diffie-helman support, ...)
      - New -Ln option to completely disable logging.

    mib2c:
      - a number of new or updated configuration templates:
        - mib2c.iterate.conf: the iterator-based table config
            now produces fuller template code than before.
        - mib2c.table_data.conf and mib2c.container.conf:
            two new "internal-row" style configs
        - mib2c.mfd.conf: "MIBs for Dummies" (or MFD) - intended to
            reduce the SNMP knowledge needed to develop MIB modules
            and add flexibility at the same time.  Run "mib2c -S
            mfd_interactive_setup=1 -c mib2c.mfd.conf OID" and follow
            its guided instructions to help you tailor its results to
            meet your needs.
        - mib2c.genhtml.conf: Generates an easier-to-read HTML view of
          a MIB tree structure.  (See http://www.Net-SNMP.org/mibs/
          for example output.)
      - more node tags available for conf file writers
      - additional search directories may be set via MIB2C_DIRS env var.
      - mib2c-update: new utility to help update mib2c generated code
          when conf file changes.
      - a mib2c.conf manual page to describe how to write mib2c .conf files.
      - support for embedded perl code in mib2c.conf files

          MIBs are implemented in the agent and on what architectures.

    perl:
      - An improved SNMP::gettable() method.  Uses GETBULK if possible and
        better GETNEXT requests if not, decodes indexes from OIDs,
        requests multiple variables at once, ...  ("perldoc SNMP" for details)
      - A NetSNMP::OID::get_indexes() function to extract index values
        from an OID.

 Ports:
   Linux:
     - new experimental tables/rewrites for Linux, including:
           ifTable, ifXTable, inetCidrRouteTable, ipCidrRouteTable,

       - Enable these talbles by specifying --enable-mfd-rewrites to configure.
       - Most of these tables have IPv6 support as well.

*5.0*

 New:

    - Much of the agent internals were completely rewritten and sports
      a new module API to make your life easier.  See the
      agent/mibgroup/examples directory for example code that makes
      use of some of the new functionality.
      (Also see http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/agent/ which has
      some incomplete documentation)
    - The agent sports embedded perl, see the perl details further below.
    - The agent supports multiple SNMPv3 contexts and mib modules can
      now register themselves under different contexts.  (see the -n
      option in the snmpcmd manual page for details on specifying
      context strings in requests)
    - The proxy code has been completely rewritten and now supports
      the use of SNMPv3 contexts to help select which proxied host you
      wish to talk to.  See the snmpd.conf manual page.
    - All the tools take --configToken=value options now.  (see -H
      output from any command for what configTokens it accepts)
    - All the tools can speak over many different transport layers
      now, including UDP/TCP (ipv4 and ipv6), AAL5pvc, and IPX.  See
      ./configure --help for details on enabling them.
      Note: the -p and -T flags to all the applications have been
      removed.  Use hostname strings like "tcp:localhost:9999"
      instead.  See the snmpcmd manual page for details.
    - snmptrapd now acts as an agentx subagent and implements portions
      of the NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB to allow captured traps and informs
      to be queried.
    - A "net-snmp-config" script will get installed which can report
      how the various tools were built (which libraries they were
      linked against, etc).  It will also help you do other things as
      well, like setting up snmpv3.  Run net-snmp-config --help for details.
    - kerberos authenticated and encrypted SNMPv3 is now possible.
      See ./configure --help for details on enabling the ksm security module.
    - The AgentX subagent protocol implementation has many new
      features and fixes.
    - mib2c was completely rewritten and has a much improved
      configuration file specification.
    - Much of the code is getting documented with "doxygen" style
      documentation.  Run "make docs" if you have doxygen installed.
    - some RMON support is available.
      (See agent/mibgroup/Rmon/README for details.)
    - The source tree has been reorganized and all the exported header
      files are now in the include subdirectory.  You can now point to
      the includes easily without having to run "make install" first.
    - the agent now requires a configuration file to access any information.
    - The entire code base has had indent run on it to effect a
      consistent coding style.  See the CodingStyle file for details.

 Perl:
    
    - The SNMP perl module now calls init_snmp() like real net-snmp
      applications, which means it will read snmp.conf configuration
      files, etc.
    - new perl specific configure options --with-perl-modules &
      --enable-embedded-perl.  See ./configure --help for details.
    - The beginnings of some new Perl modules (alpha level quality)
      are in the perl directory, including:
      - NetSNMP::agent which allows perl scripts to become net-snmp
        master or subagents
      - AnyData::SNMP is available that implements a perl DBI
        interface to map SQL commands to SNMP.  Included is a "netsh"
        shell where SQL commands can be typed, aliases created, etc.
        See the perl/AnyData_SNMP/INSTALL file for details.
    - Beginning (alpha level quality) support for embedding perl
      subroutines directly within the net-snmp agent.

      (see snmptrapd.conf(5))
    - More configuration files have been created and can be used to
      specify defaults and configuration information to the various
      applications.  Run each command with -H to see what it understands.
      (see snmp_config(5), snmpd.conf(5), snmp.conf(5), snmptrapd.conf(5))

    - The header file #defines have changed.  You may have to compile
      third party applications with -DCMU_COMPATIBLE (like perl-SNMP <= V1.7).

      /usr/local/sbin (set differently using --sbindir).

  New:

  Fixes:
    - too numerous to mention.

*3.2*

  New:
    - Top level of the mib parser has been restructured
      - no longer reads 'mib.txt'
      - no longer reads everything (MIBS/MIBDIRS)
      - reads import clauses to load other required modules
      - new man page: mib_api.3

      modification of the ucd-snmp distributed source code to add in
      new C coded mib modules.  See the README file in the
      agent/mibgroup subdirectory for details.  Modules are added and/or

*3.0.5*

  Bug fixes:
    - 'make' should not call 'autoconf' and associates anymore.
    - Fixed sun4 exit codes.  Really.
    - Changed config.h a bit to fix the mib.txt file's errors when
      some mibs were not defined for usage.

  Misc:
    - Updated configure to autoconf 2.7

*3.0.4*

  Mainly a bug fix release:
    - fixed another 32/64 bit problem:  returned exit codes on alphas
      were incorrect.
    - many system errors (e.g., no mem) were causing the agent to
      return error flags when it really was clueless.  
    - found a memory leak in the CMU routing table implementation.
    - More configure cleanups, mostly for Solaris.
    - snmp_open calls getservbyname only once now, at the request of Gary
      Hayward <gah@dirac.bellcore.com>.  Mainly for Perl users.

  New example file:  EXAMPLE.conf file (created at build time).

  local/snmpcheck has drastically improved, and now requires Tk-b8.

  You can now mung with all sorts of numbers in config.h and the
  mib.txt file will be mostly built from it if you change my defaults.

*3.0.3*

  *** default location for .conf and mib.txt files moved to
      .configure's --prefix location

  Now using GNU's auto-conf for better portability
    - prompts for important config.h information as well

  Port to Sun4/Solaris 2.4

  -h/--help and -v/--version flags added to snmpd

*3.0.2.1*

  Compilation bug fix

*3.0.2*

  Port to dec-alpha/OSF 3.1
    - quite a few more CMU bugs found during port.

  (NEWS) Added this file!

*3.0.1*

  (agent/snmpd) 
    2 Command line options added:

  (agent/snmpd)
  New built in mib functions:
    MIB.VERSIONMIBNUM.VERUPDATECONFIG (default: .1.3.6.1.4.10.100.11)
       -- set to 'integer:1' to tell the agent to re-read the config file(s).

    MIB.VERSIONMIBNUM.VERRESTARTAGENT (default: .1.3.6.1.4.10.100.12)
       -- set to 'integer:1' to tell the agent to restart (exec and quits)
