This module matches a set of source or destination ports.  Up to 15
ports can be specified.  A port range (port:port) counts as two
ports, but range isn't supported now. It can only be used in conjunction
with
.B "-p tcp"
or
.BR "-p udp" .
.TP
.BR "--source-ports " "\fI[!] port\fP[,\fIport\fP[,\fIport:port\fP...]]"
Match if the source port is one of the given ports.  The flag
.B --sports
is a convenient alias for this option.
.TP
.BR "--destination-ports " "\fI[!] port\fP[,\fIport\fP[,\fIport:port\fP...]]"
Match if the destination port is one of the given ports.  The flag
.B --dports
is a convenient alias for this option.
.TP
.BR "--ports " "\fI[!] port\fP[,\fIport\fP[,\fIport:port\fP...]]"
Match if the both the source and destination ports are equal to each
other and to one of the given ports.
