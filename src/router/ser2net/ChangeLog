2009-10-23  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Move to 2.7-rc3.

	* dataxfer.c, devcfg.c, devcfg.h, ser2net.h: Modified the tb=
	directive to work separately from tw= and tr=, so you can do all
	three at the same time independently.

	* readconfig.c: Improved an error report.
	
2009-10-22  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* ser2net.c: Set up routing errors to stderr before reading the
	config so config errors come out properly to stdout.

	* ser2net.8, ser2net.conf: Fix the documentation, it's tw=, not
	tw: for the tracefile stuff.

	* configure.in: Move to 2.7-rc2.

2009-10-15  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c, devcfg.c, readconfig.c, ser2net.8, ser2net.conf: Add
	the ability to trace data read written to trace files.

	* dataxfer.c, devcfg.c, devcfg.h, readconfig.h, utils.h: Add the
	a TRACEFILE option to trace all I/O to a file., and separate
	out the defconfig into a separate structure to avoid passing a
	boatload of things to the config.
	
2009-06-30  Sebastian Andrzej Siewior <bigeasy@linutronix.de>

	* controller.c: Fix use after free in controller

          The controller will use its dynamically allocated data after it
	  got free() in error path. What we see in syslog is:

          Jun 30 10:26:38 consrv3 ser2net[3073]: read error for
		controller port: Connection reset by peer
          Jun 30 10:26:39 consrv3 ser2net[3073]: The tcp write for
		controller had error: Bad file descriptor

          The first error is "legal" because the destitnation decided to
	  close its socket a little to early than expected. The second
	  error is allready bad because it tries to use allready
	  deallocated fd. Later we segfault.

2007-11-16  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Move to version 2.5.

2007-11-16  Harry Flick, Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	pidfile be created.

2007-05-03  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c: Change the rfc2217 signature response code
	from 0 to 100.  Best guess on what this should be, as the
	RFC doesn't give the correct value and says "text".

2007-04-26  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c: Disable the Nagle algorithm (enable TCP_NODELAY) on
	the TCP ports to avoid long delays on short pieces of data.

	* configure.in: Move to version 2.4.

2007-03-19  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	"sys/ioctl.h".

2005-10-20  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c: Fixed a problem with rfc2217 stop bit size setting.
	It was interpreting the value of "3" as 2 stop bits, but 3 is for
	1.5 stop bits, and 2 is for 2 stop bits.

	* controller.c: Fixed some warnings dealing with char/unsigned
	char problems.
	* dataxfer.c: ditto
	* telnet.c: ditto

2005-08-25  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* readconfig.c: Fix handling of lines coming from "-C".

	received.

	* readconfig.c, readconfig.h, ser2net.c, ser2net.8: Added a way to

	* configure.in: Moved to version 2.1.

	* dataxfer.c: Have the telnet option responses use the 1xx
	responses to the com port control options.  I believe this is
	wrong, but it is consistent with other products already in the
	field.

	* dataxfer.c, ser2net.c, telnet.h: Added support for setting the
	use of Cisco IOS baud rates instead of RFC 2217 ones, by command
	option.

	Ben Adams sent a patch to control the DTR and RTS lines, I rewrote
	it to make a new command to do this (instead of using devconfig,

2001-07-26  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* ser2net.spec - Added this file for RPM building, from Ivan
