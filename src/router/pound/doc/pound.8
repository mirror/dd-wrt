.SH NAME
pound \- HTTP/HTTPS reverse-proxy and load-balancer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
.B pound
[\fB\-FVcehv\fR]
[\fB\-W [\fBno\-]\fIFEATURE\fR]
[\fB\-f \fICONF-FILE\fR]
[\fB\-p \fIPID-FILE\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B Pound
is a reverse-proxy load balancing server. It accepts requests from
HTTP/HTTPS clients and distributes them to one or more Web
servers (\fIbackends\fR). These requests may be passed to backends
as plain HTTP or re-encrypted as HTTPS.
.PP
If more than one backend server is defined,
.B pound
chooses one of them randomly, based on the requested balancing
algorithm and backend priorities. By default,
.B pound
keeps track of associations between clients and backend servers (sessions).
.SH GENERAL PRINCIPLES
.P
In general
.B pound
needs three types of objects defined in order to function:
.IR listeners ,
.I services
and
.IR backends .
.TP
\fBListeners\fR
A
.I listener
is a definition of how
.B pound
receives requests from the clients (browsers). Listeners of two types
are supported: regular HTTP listeners and HTTPS listeners.  In the
simplest case, a listener must define the address and port to listen
on, with additional requirements for HTTPS listeners.
.TP
\fBServices\fR
A
.I service
routes requests to backends.  Services may be defined within a
listener or in global scope.  When a request is received,
.B pound
attempts to match it to each service in turn, starting with the
services defined in the listener itself and, if needed, continuing
with those defined at the global level.  Services may define their own
conditions as to which requests they can answer: typically this
involves certain URLs (images only, or a certain path) or specific
headers (such as the Host header).  A service may also define a
.I session
mechanism: if so, future requests from a given client will always
be answered by the same
.IR backend .
.TP
\fBBackends\fR
.I Backends
are the actual servers for the content requested. By itself,
.B pound
supplies no responses - all contents must be received from a "real"
web server.  A
.I backend
defines how the server should be contacted.
.IP
Several types of backends are defined:
.RS
.TP
.I Regular backend
Regular backends are the most often used type of backends and the
.I raison d'etre
of
.BR pound .
A regular backend passes received requests to a backend server, waits
for it to respond and sends the response back to the requesting
client.
.TP
.I Redirect backend
A redirect backend responds to each request with a redirect response.
See
.BR Redirect ,
below.
.TP
.I ACME backend
A special backend designed to handle ACME challenges.  Backends of
this type are used to handle HTTP-01 authorization when re-issuing
.I LetsEncrypt
certificates.
.IP
See the
.B ACME
section below.
.TP
.I Error backend
An error backend creates and returns an HTTP status response.
.TP
.I Emergency backend
A special case of regular backend which will be used only if all other
regular backends fail to respond.
.RE
.IP
Multiple backends may be defined within a service, in which case
.B pound
will balance the load between the available backends.
.IP
Two types of load-balancing strategies are implemented: random
balancing (default), and interleaved weighted round-robin balancing.
.IP
If a backend fails to respond, it will be considered "dead", in which
case
.B pound
will stop sending requests to it. Dead
.I backends
are periodically checked for availability, and once they respond again they
are "resurrected" and requests are sent again their way. If no backends
are available (none were defined, or all are "dead"), then
.B pound
will reply with "503 Service Unavailable", without checking additional
services.
.IP
Normally, the connection between
.B pound
and its backends is via plain HTTP.  It is, however, possible to use
HTTPS as well.
.PP
A working
.B pound
configuration may define multiple listeners and services.  They can be
identified either by 0-based ordinal number within the configuration
(or, for services, within the listener) or by their symbolic name.
Backends are identified by their ordinal number within service.
.SH REQUEST BALANCING
\fILoad balancing strategy\fR defines algorithm used to distribute
incoming requests between multiple regular backends.  Two such
strategies are implemented:
.TP
.B Weighted Random Balancing
This is the default strategy.  Each backend is assigned a numeric
.I priority
between 0 and 9 (inclusive).  The backend to use for each request is
determined at random taking into account backend priorities, so that
backends with numerically greater priorities have proportionally greater
chances of being selected than the ones with lesser priorities.  The
share of requests a backend handles can be estimated as:
.IP
.RS
.EX
.BR "Pi / S(P)" ,
.EE
.RE
.IP
where
.B Pi
is priority of the backend with index
.BR i ,
and
.B S(P)
is sum of all priorities.
.TP
.B Interleaved Weighted Round Robin Balancing
Requests are assigned to each backend in turn.  Backend priorities, or
.I weights
are used to control the share of requests handled by each backend.
The greater the weight, the more requests will be sent to this backend.
In general, the share of requests assigned to a backend is calculated
by the following relation:
.IP
.RS
.EX
.BR "(Pi + 1) / (N + S(P))" ,
.EE
.RE
.IP
where
.B N
is the number of backends,
.B Pi
and
.B S(P)
as discussed above.
.SH WORKER MODEL
Each incoming request is processed by a specific \fIworker\fR, i.e. a
thread in the running program.  The number of running workers is
controlled by three configuration parameters.  \fBWorkerMinCount\fR
defines the minimum number of workers that should always be running
(5, by default). Another parameter, \fBWorkerMaxCount\fR sets the
upper limit on the number of running workers (it defaults to 128).
.PP
At each given moment, a worker can be in one of two states: \fIidle\fR
or \fIactive\fR (processing a request).  If an incoming request
arrives when all running workers are active, and total number of
workers is less than \fBWorkerMaxCount\fR, a new thread is started and
the new request is handed to it.  If the number of active workers has
already reached maximum, the new request is added to the \fIrequest
queue\fR, where it will wait for a worker to become available to
process it.
.PP
The third parameter, \fBWorkerIdleTimeout\fR, specifies maximum time
a thread is allowed to spend in the \fIidle\fR state.  If a worker
remains idle longer than that and total number of workers is greater
than the allotted minimum (\fBWorkerMinCount\fR), the idle worker is
terminated.
.SH OPTIONS
The following command line options are available:
.TP
\fB\-c\fR
Check only:
.B pound
will exit immediately after parsing the configuration file. This may
be used for running a quick syntax check before actually activating a
server.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR
Log to standard error (standard output for \fBLOG_DEBUG\fR and
\fBLOG_INFO\fR facilities).  This option implies \fIforeground mode\fR
(\fB\-F\fR) and overrides the \fILogLevel\fR configuration setting.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR
Foreground mode.  The program will not detach from the controlling
terminal and will remain in foreground after startup.  This overrides
the \fBDaemon\fR configuration setting.  The log stream (syslog
facility or stderr) requested in the configuration remains in effect.
See also the \fB\-e\fR option, above.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fIFILE\fR
Location of the configuration file (see below for a full description
of the format).  Default is
.IR $sysconfdir/pound.cfg ,
where \fI$sysconfdir\fR stands for the system configuration directory,
as determined at build time.  Most often it is either
.IR /usr/local/etc ,
or
.IR /etc .
.TP
.B \-h
Print short command line usage summary and exit.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR pid_file
Location of the PID file.
.B Pound
will write its own PID into this file. Normally this is used for shell
scripts that control starting and stopping of the daemon. See the
description of
.B PIDFile
statement in the
.B GLOBAL DIRECTIVES
section below, for a detailed discussion of this file.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Verbose mode: during startup, error messages will be sent to stderr
(stdout for \fBLOG_DEBUG\fR and \fBLOG_INFO\fR facilities).  If
.B pound
was configured to log to syslog, error diagnostics will be duplicated
there as well.  After startup the configuration settings take effect.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Print version:
.B pound
will exit immediately after printing the current version, licensing
terms, and configuration flags.
.TP
\fB\-W [\fBno\-]\fIFEATURE\fR
Enable or disable (if prefixed with \fBno\-\fR) additional \fBpound\fR
features.  As of this version, the following \fIFEATURE\fRs are implemented:
.RS
.TP
.RB [ no\- ] dns
Resolve host names found in configuration file.  This is the default.
You can disable it if your configuration file refers to backends only
by their IP addresses, in order to suppress potentially lengthy
network host address lookups.
.TP
.B no\-include\-dir
Don't set the include directory to the system configuration
directory.  This means that each relative filename used in arguments
to the directives in the configuration file will be looked up in the
current working directory.  This feature is useful mainly in
testsuite.
.TP
\fBinclude\-dir=\fIDIR\fR
Override the default include directory setting.  Set it to \fIDIR\fR.
See the discussion of the \fBIncludeDir\fR directive in section
.BR "GLOBAL DIRECTIVES" ,
below.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
Each line in the file is considered a complete configuration
directive. Empty lines and comments are ignored. Comments are
introduced with a \fB#\fR sign and extend to the end of line on which
it appears.
.PP
There are three types of directives:
.B global
directives (they affect the settings for the entire program instance),
.B listener
directives (they define which requests
.B pound
will listen for), and
.B service
directives (they affect only a specific group of requests).
.PP
In general, a directive consists of a \fIkeyword\fR and one or
more \fIvalues\fR, separated by any amount of whitespace.  Leading and
trailing whitespace is ignored. Keywords are case-insensitive. A
\fIvalue\fR can be:
.TP
.I Numeric
A decimal number.
.TP
.I Boolean
The words \fByes\fR, \fBtrue\fR, \fBon\fR, or \fB1\fR indicating
\fItrue\fR, and \fBno\fR, \fBfalse\fR, \fBoff\fR, or \fB0\fR
indicating \fIfalse\fR. All words are case-insensitive.
.TP
.I String
Any sequence of characters between double-quotes.  A backslash is
treated as an escape character: if it is followed by a double-quote
or another backslash, it is removed and the character after it is
read literally.  If it is followed by any other character, a warning
message is printed.
.TP
.I Identifier
A sequence of characters starting with an ASCII letter and consisting
of letters, digits and underscores.
.TP
.I IP address
An IPv4 or IPv6 address in numeric form, or a hostname.
.PP
Unless specified otherwise, directives may appear in any order.
.SH "GLOBAL DIRECTIVES"
Global directives may appear anywhere at the top level within the
configuration file, although it is customary for them to be at the
start.
.TP
\fBUser\fR "\fIuser_name\fR"
Specify the user
.B pound
will run as (must be defined in the system user database).
.TP
\fBGroup\fR "\fIgroup_name\fR"
Specify the group
.B pound
will run as (must be defined in the system group database).
.TP
\fBRootJail\fR "\fIdirectory\fR"
Specify the directory that
.B pound
will chroot to at runtime.
.TP
\fBHeaderOption\fR \fIopt\fR...
Sets default options for header addition.  \fIopt\fR is one of:
\fBnone\fR to disable additional headers, \fBforwarded\fR to enable
adding
.BR X\-Forwarded\-For ,
.BR X\-Forwarded\-Proto ,
and
.B X\-Forwarded\-Port
headers, and
.B ssl
to enable passing information about SSL certificates in various
.B X\-SSL\-*
headers.  The default is
.IP
.RS
.B HeaderOption forwarded ssl
.RE
.IP
This setting can be overridden on a per-listener basis.  See the
description of \fBHeaderOption\fR directive in \fBHTTP Listener\fR
section, and section \fBBUILT-IN HEADERS\fR, for a detailed
discussion of various header modification directives and their effect.
.TP
\fBBalancer\fR \fBrandom\fR | \fBiwrr\fR
Defines the load-balancing strategy to use.  Possible arguments are:
\fBrandom\fR, to use weighted random balancing algorithm. an
\fBiwrr\fR, meaning interleaved weighted round robin balancing.
See
.BR "REQUEST BALANCING" ,
above, for a detailed discussion of these balancing strategies.
.IP
The \fBBalancer\fR statement in global scope applies to all
\fBService\fR directives that don't contain \fBBalancer\fR
definitions of their own.
.TP
\fBDaemon\fR \fIbool\fR
Have
.B pound
run in the foreground (if \fIfalse\fR) or as a daemon (if
\fItrue\fR). By default
.B pound
runs as a daemon (detaches itself from the controlling terminal and
puts itself in the background). By specifying this option you can force
.B pound
to work like a regular process. Useful for debugging or if you want to
use something like \fIdaemontools\fR.
.TP
\fBSupervisor\fR \fIbool\fR
When running in daemon mode, start a \fIsupervisor\fR process first.
This process will monitor the subordinate \fBpound\fR process, restarting
it if it fails.
.TP
\fBWorkerMinCount\fR \fIN\fR
Sets minimum number of worker threads that must always be running.
The default is 5.
See the section
.B WORKER MODEL
above for a detailed discussion.
.TP
\fBWorkerMaxCount\fR \fIN\fR
Sets maximum number of worker threads.  The default is 128.
See the section
.B WORKER MODEL
above for a detailed discussion.
.TP
\fBWorkerIdleTimeout\fR \fISEC\fR
Sets idle timeout for a worker thread.  Default is 30 seconds.
See the section
.B WORKER MODEL
above for a detailed discussion.
.TP
\fBThreads\fR \fIN\fR
This statement, retained for backward compatibility with previous
versions of
.BR pound ,
is equivalent to:
.IP
.RS
.EX
WorkerMinCount \fIN\fR
WorkerMaxCount \fIN\fR
.EE
.RE
.TP
\fBLogFacility\fR \fIident\fR
Specify the log facility to use.  The
.I ident
is one of the following:
.BR auth ,
.BR authpriv ,
.BR cron ,
.BR daemon ,
.BR ftp ,
.BR kern ,
.BR lpr ,
.BR mail ,
.BR news ,
.BR syslog ,
.BR user ,
.BR uucp ,
.B local0
through
.BR local7 .
The default value is
.BR daemon .
Using a \fB\-\fR (dash) for the facility name causes
.B pound
to log to stdout/stderr.
.TP
\fBLogLevel\fR \fIn\fR
Specify the logging level: 0 for no logging, 1 (default) for regular
logging, 2 for extended logging (show chosen backend server as well),
3 for Apache-like format (Combined Log Format with Virtual Host), 4
(same as 3 but without the virtual host information) and 5 (same as 4
but with information about the
.B Service
and
.B Backend
used).
This value can be overridden for specific listeners.
.TP
\fBIgnoreCase\fR \fIbool\fR
Ignore case when matching URLs (default: \fIfalse\fR). This value can be
overridden for specific services.
.IP
This statement is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
Please, use the \fB\-icase\fR option to the \fBURL\fR directive
instead.  See the discussion of \fIoptions\fR in
.B Service Matching Directives
section below.
.TP
\fBAlive\fR \fIn\fR
Specify how often
.B pound
will check for resurrected backend hosts (default: 30 seconds). In
general, it is a good idea to set this as low as possible - it
will find resurrected hosts faster. However, if you set it too
low it will consume resources - so beware.
.TP
\fBClient\fR \fIn\fR
Specify for how long
.B pound
will wait for a client request (default: 10 seconds). After this
long has passed without the client sending any data
.B pound
will close the connection. Set it higher if your clients
time-out on a slow network or over-loaded server, lower if you
start getting DOS attacks or run into problems with IE clients.
This value can be overridden for specific listeners.
.TP
\fBTimeOut\fR \fIn\fR
How long should
.B pound
wait for a response from the backend (in seconds). Default: 15 seconds.
This value can be overridden for specific backends.
.TP
\fBConnTO\fR \fIn\fR
How long should
.B pound
wait for a connection to the backend (in seconds). Default: the
.B TimeOut
value. This value can be overridden for specific backends.
.TP
\fBWSTimeOut\fR \fIn\fR
How long should
.B pound
wait for data from either backend or client in a connection upgraded to
a WebSocket (in seconds). Default: 600 seconds.
This value can be overridden for specific backends.
.TP
\fBGrace\fR \fIn\fR
How long should
.B pound
continue to answer existing connections after a receiving and INT or HUP
signal (default: 30 seconds). The configured listeners are closed
immediately. You can bypass this behaviour by stopping
.B pound
with a TERM or QUIT signal, in which case the program exits without any
delay.
.TP
\fBSSLEngine\fR "\fIname\fR"
Use an OpenSSL hardware acceleration card called \fIname\fR. Available
only if OpenSSL-engine is installed on your system.
.TP
\fBECDHcurve\fR "\fIname\fR"
Use the named curve for elliptical curve encryption (default: prime256v1).
.TP
\fBControl\fR "\fIpathname\fR"
Set the control socket path.
See the
.B Control socket
section below, for a detailed description of this feature.
.TP
\fBIncludeDir\fR "\fIdir\fR"
Sets the \fIinclude directory\fR.  This is the directory
where \fIpound\fR looks for relative file names that appear in other
configuration directives (e.g. \fIInclude\fR).  The default value is
the system configuration directory as set at compile time (you can
check its value in the output of \fBpound -V\fR).  This initial value
can be changed in the command line using the
\fB\-W include\-dir=\fIname\fR option or reset to the current working
directory using the \fB\-W no\-include\-dir\fR option (see the
discussion of \fB\-W\fR below).
.TP
\fBInclude\fR "\fIfile\fR"
Include the file as though it were part of the configuration file.  If
\fIfile\fR is a relative file name, it will be looked in the \fIinclude
directory\fR (see above).
.IP
This directive is allowed both at topmost level and in any subsections
of the configuration file.
.TP
\fBAnonymise\fR
(alternative spelling \fBAnonymize\fR also accepted) Replace the last
byte of the client address with 0 for logging purposes.
Default: log the client address in full.
.TP
\fBACL\fR "\fIname\fR"
Define a \fInamed access control list\fR (\fIACL\fR).  An ACL is a
list of network addresses in CIDR notation, one address per line,
terminated with an
.B End
directive on a line by itself.  E.g.:
.IP
.RS
.EX
ACL "secure"
   "192.0.2.0/26"
   "203.0.113.0/24"
End
.EE
.RE
.IP
The
.B Include
directive is allowed within
.BR ACL .
.IP
Named ACLs can be used in \fBService\fR definitions to make services
available from certain IP addresses only.
.RE
.TP
\fBPIDFile\fR "\fIfilename\fR"
Sets the name of the file where to store program PID.  It can be
overridden by the
.B \-p
command line option.
.IP
.I Notice
the following:
.RS
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step].
PID file is used only in daemon mode (\fBDaemon on\fR in the
configuration file).
.IP \n+[step].
When running with a supervisor, this file holds PID of the supervisor
process.  Otherwise, it holds PID of the main
.B pound
process.  This means it is always suitable for signalling the program
using the traditional \fBkill `cat filename`\fR technique.
.IP \n+[step].
Before shutting down,
.B pound
removes this file.  However, this may be not possible if it switches to
privileges of another user after startup (at least one of \fBUser\fR or
\fBGroup\fR are set in the configuration file) and the file is stored in
a directory whose permissions forbid write access for that user.
.RE
.SS Control socket
.B Pound
can be instructed to listen on a UNIX socket for management requests,
which will allow you to obtain information about the running
instance, change state of configured listeners, services, and
backends, etc.  These requests may be issued by using the
.BR poundctl (8)
utility.
.PP
The use of this
.I control socket
is configured via the
.B Control
statement.  This statement has two forms.  In
.I inline
form, the statement takes a single argument, specifying the name of
the UNIX socket file to create and listen on.  For example:
.PP
.EX
Control "/run/pound.sock"
.EE
.PP
The file will be owned by the user that started
.B pound
(normally root) and will have mode 0600.
.PP
The block form allows you to specify file mode and, to certain extent,
the socket file ownership:
.PP
.EX
Control
    Socket "/run/pound.sock"
    Mode 660
    ChangeOwner true
End
.EE
.PP
The substatements are:
.TP
.B Socket "\fIfilename\fR"
Specifies the name of the socket file to use.  This is the only
mandatory statement in the block form.
.TP
.B Mode \fIoctal\fR
Sets the mode of the socket file.
.TP
.B ChangeOwner \fIbool\fR
This statement takes effect if at least one of
.B User
or
.B Group
global statements is used.  When set to
.B true
it will change the owner of the socket file to that specified by
those two statements.
.SH "HTTP Listener"
An HTTP listener defines an address and port that
.B pound
will listen on for HTTP requests.  The listener declaration begins with
the keyword
.B ListenHTTP
on a separate line.  The keyword may be followed by a quoted string
supplying listener name.  This name is a unique label that identifies
the listener.
.PP
All configuration directives enclosed between
.B ListenHTTP
and
.B End
are specific to a single HTTP listener.  At the very least you must specify
IP address and port for each listener. The following directives are
available:
.TP
\fBAddress\fR \fIaddress\fR
The address that
.B pound
will listen on. This can be a numeric IP address, or a symbolic host name
that must be resolvable at run-time, or a full pathname of a UNIX
socket.  Either this parameter or
.B SocketFrom
(see below) must be present. The address 0.0.0.0 may be used as an
alias for 'all available addresses on this machine', but this practice
is strongly discouraged, as it will interfere with the rewriting
mechanisms (see below).
.TP
\fBPort\fR \fIport\fR
The port number or service name that
.B pound
will listen on.  This parameter must be present if the
.B Address
parameter contains an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
.TP
\fBSocketFrom\fR "\fIpathname\fR"
Read the socket to listen on from the UNIX socket given as argument.
If this parameter is supplied, neither
.B Address
nor
.B Port
may be used.  This parameter is intended for testing
.BR pound .
.TP
\fBxHTTP\fR \fIn\fR
Defines which HTTP verbs are accepted. The possible values are:
.IP
.B 0
(default) accept only standard HTTP requests (GET, POST, HEAD).
.IP
.B 1
additionally allow extended HTTP requests (PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
.IP
.B 2
additionally allow standard WebDAV verbs (LOCK, UNLOCK, PROPFIND,
PROPPATCH, SEARCH, MKCOL, MOVE, COPY, OPTIONS, TRACE, MKACTIVITY,
CHECKOUT, MERGE, REPORT).
.IP
.B 3
additionally allow MS extensions WebDAV verbs (SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE,
NOTIFY, BPROPFIND, BPROPPATCH, POLL, BMOVE, BCOPY, BDELETE, CONNECT).
.TP
\fBClient\fR \fIn\fR
Override the global
.I Client
time-out value.
.TP
\fBCheckURL\fR "\fIpattern\fR"
Define a pattern that must be matched by each request sent to this
listener. A request that does not match is considered to be illegal.
By default
.B pound
accepts all requests (i.e. the pattern is ".*"), but you are free to
limit it to something more reasonable. Please note that this applies
only to the request path -
.B pound
will still check that the request is syntactically correct.
.TP
\fBErr404\fR "\fIfilename\fR"
A file with the text to be displayed if an Error 404 occurs.
Default text: "Not Found.".
.TP
\fBErr413\fR "\fIfilename\fR"
A file with the text to be displayed if an Error 413 occurs.
Default text: "Request too large.".
.TP
\fBErr414\fR "\fIfilename\fR"
A file with the text to be displayed if an Error 414 occurs.
Default text: "Request URI is too long.".
.TP
\fBErr500\fR "\fIfilename\fR"
A file with the text to be displayed if an Error 500 occurs.
Default text: "An internal server error occurred. Please try again later.".
.TP
\fBErr501\fR "\fIfilename\fR"
A file with the text to be displayed if an Error 501 occurs.
Default text: "This method may not be used.".
.TP
\fBErr503\fR "\fIfilename\fR"
A file with the text to be displayed if an Error 503 occurs.
Default text: "The service is not available. Please try again later.".
.TP
\fBMaxRequest\fR \fIn\fR
Request maximal size. All requests will be limited to these many
bytes. If a request contains more data than allowed, an error 413 is
returned. Default: unlimited.
.TP
\fBRewriteLocation\fR 0|1|2
If set to 1, force
.B pound
to change the Location: and Content-location: headers in responses. If they
point to the backend itself or to the listener (but with the wrong protocol),
the response will be changed to show the virtual host in the request. Default:
1 (active).  If the value is set to 2, only the backend address is compared;
this is useful for redirecting a request to an HTTPS listener on
the same server as the HTTP listener.
.TP
\fBRewriteDestination\fR \fIbool\fR
If set to \fItrue\fI, force
.B pound
to change the "Destination:" header in requests. The header is changed
to point to the backend itself with the correct protocol. Default:
\fIfalse\fR.
.TP
\fBLogLevel\fR \fIvalue\fR
Override the global
.B LogLevel
value.
.TP
\fBService\fR [ "\fIname\fR" ]
This defines a private service (see below for service definition
syntax). This service will be used only by this listener. Optional
\fIname\fR supplies the label, that can be used in
.BR poundctl (8)
requests to identify the service.  This label must be unique among all
services within the enclosing listener, or, for global services,
within the configuration.
.TP
\fBACME\fR "\fIdirectory\fR"
Serve ACME challenge requests from the given
.IR directory .
See section
.B ACME
below.
.TP
\fBHeaderOption\fR \fIopt\fR...
Modifies global header addition options for this listener.  Global
options are set by the \fBHeaderOption\fR directive in the global
scope and default to \fBforwarded ssl\fR.  \fIopt\fR is one of:
.RS
.TP
.B all
Enable all additional headers.
.TP
.B none
Disable all additional headers.
.TP
.B forwarded
Enable adding
.BR X\-Forwarded\-For ,
.BR X\-Forwarded\-Proto ,
and
.B X\-Forwarded\-Port
headers.
.TP
.B ssl
Enable passing information about SSL certificates in various
.B X\-SSL\-*
headers.
.RE
.IP
Each option except \fBnone\fR can be prefixed with \fBno\-\fR to
revert its meaning.
.IP
For example, to disable adding the \fBX\-SSL\-*\fR headers for a
listener, one would use:
.IP
.RS
.B HeaderOption no\-ssl
.RE
.IP
See the description of \fBHeaderOption\fR directive in \fBGLOBAL
DIRECTIVES\fR section, and section \fBBUILT-IN HEADERS\fR, for a
detailed discussion of various header modification directives and
their effect.
.SS Modification directives
The following directives modify the incoming request prior to passing
it to the selected service.  These are discussed in detail
in section
.BR "REQUEST MODIFICATION" ,
below.
.TP
\fBDeleteHeader\fR "\fIheader\fB: \fIpattern\fR"
Remove certain headers from the incoming requests. All occurrences of
the matching header will be removed.
.TP
\fBSetHeader\fR "\fIheader\fB: \fIvalue\fR"
Add header to the request passed to the backend server. Specified
header line is added verbatim. Use multiple \fBHeaderAdd\fR
directives if you need to add more than one header.
.TP
\fBSetURL\fR "\fIvalue\fR"
Sets the URL part of the request.
.TP
\fBSetPath\fR "\fIvalue\fR"
Sets the path part.
.TP
\fBSetQuery\fR "\fIvalue\fR"
Sets the query part.
.TP
\fBSetQueryParam\fR "\fIname\fR" "\fIvalue\fR"
Modifies the query.  Sets the query parameter \fIname\fR to \fIvalue\fR.
.TP
.BR Rewrite " ... [ " Else " ... ] " End
Conditionally apply request modification depending on whether request
matches certain conditions.
.SS Compatibility directives
The following directives are retained for compatibility with previous
versions of
.BR pound .
They will be removed in future releases.
.TP
\fBHeaderAdd\fR "\fIheader\fB: \fIvalue\fR"
Same as \fBSetHeader\fR.
.TP
\fBAddHeader\fR "\fIheader\fB: \fIvalue\fR"
Same as \fBSetHeader\fR.
.TP
\fBHeaderRemove\fR "\fIpattern\fR"
Same as \fBDeleteHeader\fR.
.TP
\fBHeadRemove\fR "\fIpattern\fR"
Same as \fBDeleteHeader\fR.
.SH "HTTPS Listener"
HTTPS listener defines an address and port that
.B pound
will listen on for HTTPS requests.  The listener declaration begins with
the keyword
.B ListenHTTPS
on a separate line.  The keyword may be followed by a quoted string
supplying listener name.  This name is a unique label that identifies
the listener.
.PP
All configuration directives enclosed between
.B ListenHTTPS
and
.B End
are specific to a single HTTPS listener. At the very least you must specify
an address, a port and a server certificate for each listener. All directives
defined for HTTP listeners are applicable to HTTPS listeners as well. The
following additional directives are also available:
.TP
\fBCert\fR "\fIfilename\fR"
Specify the server certificate. The
.I certificate file
is the file containing the certificate, possibly a certificate chain
and the signature for this server. This directive is
.B mandatory
for HTTPS listeners.
.IP
Please note that multiple
.B Cert
directives are allowed if your OpenSSL version supports SNI. In such cases,
the first directive is the default certificate, with additional certificates
used if the client requests them.
.IP
The ordering of the directives is important: the first certificate where the CN
matches the client request will be used, so put your directives in the
most-specific-to-least specific order (i.e. wildcard certificates
.B after
host-specific certificates).
.IP
.B Cert
directives
.B must
precede all other SSL-specific directives.
.TP
\fBClientCert\fR 0|1|2|3 \fIdepth\fR
Ask for the client's HTTPS certificate: 0 - don't ask (default), 1 - ask,
2 - ask and fail if no certificate was presented, 3 - ask but do not verify.
.I Depth
is the depth of verification for a client certificate (up to 9). The default
depth limit is 9, allowing for the peer certificate and additional 9 CA
certificates that must be verified.
.TP
\fBDisable\fR SSLv2|SSLv3|TLSv1|TLSv1_1|TLSv1_2
Disable the protocol \fBand all lower protocols as well\fR.
This is due to a limitation in OpenSSL, which does not support
disabling a single protocol. For example,
.B Disable TLSv1
would disable SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLSv1, thus allowing only TLSv1_1 and TLSv1_2.
.TP
\fBCiphers\fR "\fIcipher_list\fR"
This is the list of ciphers that will be accepted by the SSL
connection; it is a string in the same format as in OpenSSL
.BR ciphers (1)
and
.BR SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list (3).
.TP
\fBSSLHonorCipherOrder\fR \fIbool\fR
If set to \fItrue\fR, the server will broadcast a preference to use
ciphers in the order supplied in the \fBCiphers\fR directive.  If the
value is \fIfalse\fR, the server will accept any cipher from the
.B Ciphers
list.  Default value is \fIfalse\fR.
.TP
\fBSSLAllowClientRenegotiation\fR 0|1|2
If this value is 0, client initiated renegotiation will be disabled.
This will mitigate DoS exploits based on client renegotiation,
regardless of the patch status of clients and servers related to
"Secure renegotiation".  If the value is 1, secure renegotiation is
supported.  If the value is 2, insecure renegotiation is supported,
with unpatched clients. \fBThis can lead to a DoS and a Man in the
Middle attack!\fR The default value is 0.
.TP
\fBCAlist\fR "\fIfilename\fR"
Set the list of "trusted" CA's for this server. The \fIfilename\fR is
the name of a file containing a sequence of CA certificates (PEM
format). The names of the defined CA certificates will be sent to the
client on connection.
.TP
\fBVerifyList\fR "\fIfilename\fR"
Set the CA (Certificate Authority). The \fIfilename\fR is a file that
contains the CA root certificates (in PEM format).
.IP
.IR "Please note":
there is an important difference between the CAlist and the VerifyList. The
CAlist tells the client (browser) which client certificates it should
send. The VerifyList defines which CAs are actually used for the
verification of the returned certificate.
.TP
\fBCRLlist\fR "\fIfilename\fR"
Set the CRL (Certificate Revocation List) file. The \fIfilename\fR is a file
that contains the CRLs (in PEM format).
.TP
\fBNoHTTPS11\fR 0|1|2
Behave like an HTTP/1.0 server for HTTPS clients. If this value is
0, disable the check. If the value is 1, do not allow multiple
requests on SSL connections. If the value is 2 (default), disable multiple
requests on SSL connections only for MSIE clients. Required
work-around for a bug in certain versions of IE.
.SH "Service"
A service is a definition of which backend servers
.B pound
will use to reply to incoming requests. A service may be defined as part
of a listener (in which case it will be used only by that listener), or
globally (which makes it available to all listeners).
.B Pound
selects a listener based on user-supplied conditions that analyze the
incoming request URL and/or headers.  It will always scan
listener-specific services first.  If none matches, it
will try the global ones.  Services are tried in the same order as
they are defined in configuration.
.PP
All configuration directives enclosed between
.B Service
and
.B End
are specific to a single service. They can be subdivided into two
categories: \fIservice matching directives\fR and \fIbackend definitions\fR.
.SS Service Matching Directives
These directives determine whether a particular request should be
handled by this service.  When a request arrives, each service is
considered in turn (first services defined within the listener that
received the request, then the ones defined in global scope).  First
service that matches the request will be used.  If no service matches,
a 503 "Service unavailable" error is returned.
.PP
Unless explicitly stated in the configuration file, all matching
directives are joined by a boolean \fBAND\fR.
.PP
A service with no matching directives always matches.
.TP
\fBACL\fR "\fIname\fR"
Match the source IP address against the named ACL.  The ACL must have
been defined earlier (see the
.B ACL
statement in
.B "GLOBAL DIRECTIVES"
section above).  If the IP doesn't match, then this service will be
skipped and next one tried.
.TP
\fBACL\fR
This statement defines an unnamed ACL to match the source IP against.
This line must be followed by one or more lines defining CIDRs, as
described in the
.B "GLOBAL DIRECTIVES"
section above.
The ACL definition is finished with a
.B End
keyword on a line by itself.
.sp
Semantically it is equivalent to the named ACL reference described above.
.TP
\fBURL\fR [\fIoptions\fR] "\fIpattern\fR"
Match the URL of the incoming request.  By default, \fIpattern\fR is
treated as case-sensitive extended regular expression.  This can be
changed by \fIoptions\fR, described below.
.TP
\fBHeader\fR [\fIoptions\fR] "\fIpattern\fR"
The request must contain at least one header matching the given
\fIpattern\fR.  By default, \fIpattern\fR is treated as
case-insensitive extended regular expression.  This can be changed by
\fIoptions\fR, described below.
.TP
\fBHost\fR [\fIoptions\fR] "\fIhostname\fR"
The request must contain a \fBHost\fR header whose value matches
\fIhostname\fR.  In the absence of \fIoptions\fR, case-insensitive
exact match is assumed, i.e. this construct is equivalent to
.IP
\fBHeader\fR "Host:[[:space:]]*\fIqhost\fR"
.IP
where \fIqhost\fR is the "\fIhostname\fR" argument in quoted form, i.e. with
all characters that have special meaning in regular expressions
escaped.
.IP
See below for the discussion of \fIoptions\fR and their effect on
matching.
.IP
This statement is provided to facilitate handling of \fIvirtual
hosts\fR.  See the
.B EXAMPLES
section.
.TP
\fBPath\fR [\fIoptions\fR] "\fIpattern\fR"
Match the path part of the incoming request.
.TP
\fBQuery\fR [\fIoptions\fR] "\fIpattern\fR"
Match the query part of the incoming request.
.TP
\fBQueryParam\fR "\fIname\fR" [\fIoptions\fR] "\fIpattern\fR"
Match the value of the query parameter \fIname\fR.
.PP
The \fIoptions\fR argument in the above directives can be used to
select the comparison method.  It consists of zero or more option
flags from the following list:
.TP
.B \-re
Use regular expression matching.
.TP
.B \-exact
Use exact string matching.
.TP
.B \-beg
Exact match at the beginning of string (prefix match).
.TP
.B \-end
Exact match at the end of string (suffix match).
.TP
.B \-case
Case-sensitive comparison.
.TP
.B \-icase
Case-insensitive comparison.
.TP
.B \-file
Treat \fIpattern\fR as the name of a file to read patterns from.  If
the name is relative, it will be looked up in the \fIinclude
directory\fR (see the discussion of the \fBIncludeDir\fR directory
above).  Patterns are read from the file line by line.  Leading and
trailing whitespace is removed.  Empty
lines and comments (lines starting with \fB#\fR) are ignored.
.PP
For example, the following will match any request whose \fBHost\fR
header begins with "www." (case-insensitive):
.PP
.EE
Host -icase -beg "www."
.EX
.SS Compatibility directives
The following directives are provided for backward compatibility with
older versions of
.BR pound .
They will be removed in future versions.
.TP
\fBHeadRequire\fR "\fIpattern\fR"
Same as \fBHeader\fR.
.TP
\fBHeadDeny\fR "\fIpattern\fR"
A shortcut for
.IP
\fBNot header\fR "\fIpattern\fR"
.IP
In other words: the request may
.B not
contain any header matching the given pattern.  See the
.B Negation
section, below.
.SS Negation
Prefixing any of the directives discussed above with \fBnot\fR will
revert the sense of comparison.  For example,
.PP
.EX
Not url "^/static/"
.EE
.PP
will match any request, whose URL \fIdoes not\fR begin with "/static/".
.PP
Negating compound statements is allowed as well, e.g.:
.PP
.EX
Not ACL
   "192.0.2.0/26"
   "203.0.113.0/24"
End
.EE
.SS Match statement
A \fBMatch\fR statement allows you to group matching directives using
arbitrary boolean operations.  The syntax is:
.PP
.EX
Match \fIOP\fR
  \fIdirectives\fR...
End
.EE
.PP
where \fIOP\fR is \fBAND\fR to use boolean and, and \fBOR\fR
(case-insensitive) to use boolean \fIor\fR, and \fIdirectives\fR stand for
any number of matching directives discussed above (including the
\fBMatch\fR directive).
.PP
Prefixing \fBMatch\fR directive with a word \fBnot\fR reverts its result.
.PP
\fBMatch\fR directives can be nested to any depth.
.PP
Technically, an implicit \fBMatch AND\fR block is created around
unenclosed matching directives on the top level of a \fBService\fR block.
.SS Modification directives
The following directives modify the incoming request prior to passing
it to the selected backend.  These are discussed in detail
in the section
.BR "REQUEST MODIFICATION" ,
below.
.TP
\fBDeleteHeader\fR "\fIheader\fB: \fIpattern\fR"
Remove matching headers from the incoming requests.
.TP
\fBSetHeader\fR "\fIheader\fB: \fIvalue\fR"
Add the defined header to the request passed to the backend
server.
.TP
\fBSetURL\fR "\fIvalue\fR"
Sets the URL part of the request.
.TP
\fBSetPath\fR "\fIvalue\fR"
Sets the path part.
.TP
\fBSetQuery\fR "\fIvalue\fR"
Sets the query part.
.TP
\fBSetQueryParam\fR "\fIname\fR" "\fIvalue\fR"
Modifies the query.  Sets the query parameter \fIname\fR to \fIvalue\fR.
.TP
.BR Rewrite " ... [ " Else " ... ] " End
Conditionally apply request modification depending on whether request
matches certain conditions.
.SS Backend definitions
.TP
\fBBalancer\fR \fBrandom\fR | \fBiwrr\fR
Defines the load-balancing strategy to use.  Possible arguments are:
\fBrandom\fR, to use weighted random balancing algorithm. an
\fBiwrr\fR, meaning interleaved weighted round robin balancing.
See
.BR "REQUEST BALANCING" ,
above, for a detailed discussion of these balancing strategies.
.IP
This directive overrides the \fBBalancer\fR directive in global scope.
.TP
\fBBackend\fR
Directives enclosed between
.B Backend
and
the following
.B End
directives define a single backend server (see below for details). You
may define multiple backends per service, in which case
.B pound
will attempt to load-balance between them.
.TP
\fBRedirect\fR [\fIcode\fR] "\fIurl\fR"
This is a special type of backend. Instead of sending the request to a backend
.B pound
replies immediately with a redirection to the given URL.
.IP
It is allowed to define multiple redirectors in a service, as well as
mixing them with regular backends, but there is little if any
justification for such usage, so it is deprecated.
.IP
Optional \fIcode\fR can be one of:
.BR 301 ,
.B 302
(the default),
.BR 303 ,
.BR 307 ,
or
.BR 308 .
.IP
The redirection destination is determined by the actual
.I url
you specify.  It can contain references to parenthesized subexpressions
in the eight recently matched request matching directives of the enclosing
.BR Service .
Syntactically, \fB$\fIN\fR (\fIN\fR is a decimal number)
refers to \fIN\fRth parenthesized subexpression of the most
recently matched statement, and \fB$\fIN\fB(\fIM\fB)\fR refers to
\fIN\fRth parenthesized subexpression of \fIM\fRth recently matched
statement.  Numbering of subexpressions starts at 1 (\fB$0\fR refers
to the entire matching string).  Numbering of matches starts
at 0.
.IP
For example, given the following statements
.IP
.EX
Host -re "www\\.(.+)"
Header -re -icase "^Content-Type: *(.*)"
Path "^/static(/.*)?"
.EE
.IP
\fB$1\fR refers to the subgroup of \fBPath\fR, \fB$1(1)\fR - to that of
\fBHeader\fR, and \fB$1(2)\fR - to that of \fBHost\fR.
.IP
Curly braces may be used to avoid incorrectly parsing text fragment
that follows the reference as being its part.  This is useful if the
reference is immediately followed by a decimal digit or opening
parenthesis, as in: \fB"${1}(text)"\fR.
.IP
To insert a literal dollar or percent sign in
.IR url ,
use
.B $$
or
.BR $% ,
correspondingly.
.IP
Beside these constructs,
.I request accessors
can be used.  A request accessor is
.IP
.RS
.EX
.IR %[ name ]
.EE
.RE
.IP
where \fIname\fR is one of:
.BR url ,
.BR path ,
.BR query ,
.BR param ,
and
.BR header ,
denoting the corresponding part of the request.  The
.B param
and
.B header
accessors take a single argument: the name of the query parameter or
HTPP header.  Accessors are explained in detail in section
.BR "REQUEST MODIFICATION DIRECTIVES" .
.IP
For compatibility with previous \fBpound\fR versions, if no
\fB$\fIN\fR references are found in
.IR url ,
the following logic is used:
if it is a "pure" host (i.e. with no path) then the client will be
redirected to the host you specified, with the original request path
appended. If your
.I url
does contain a path, then the request path is ignored.
.IP
Examples: the following swaps the first two path components of the
original URL:
.IP
.EX
Service
    Host -re "(.+)"
    URL "^/([^/]+)/([^/]+)(/.*)?"
    Redirect "http://$0(1)/$2/$1$3"
End
.EE
.IP
Notice the use of \fBHost\fR to supply hostname part for the redirect.
.IP
Using request accessors, the above example can be rewritten as:
.IP
.EX
Service
    URL "^/([^/]+)/([^/]+)(/.*)?"
    Redirect "http://%[header host]/$2/$1$3"
End
.EE
.IP
Compatibility syntax: if you specified
.IP
.EX
Redirect "http://abc.example"
.EE
.IP
and the client requested
.I http://xyz/a/b/c
then it will be redirected to
.IR "http://abc.example/a/b/c" ,
but if you specified
.IP
.EX
Redirect "http://abc.example/index.html"
.EE
.IP
it will be sent to
.IR "http://abc.example/index.html".
.TP
\fBError \fISTATUS\fR [\fIFILE\fR]
Special case of backend that returns HTTP error page.  The \fISTATUS\fR
argument supplies HTTP status code.  Optional \fIFILE\fR argument is
the name of a disk file with the error page content (HTML).  If not
supplied, the text is determined as usual: first the
.BI Err STATUS
statement for the enclosing listener is consulted.  If it is not present, the
default error page is used.
.IP
The \fBError\fR directive is useful in a catch-all service, which
outputs an error page if no service matching the incoming request was
found.  See the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section for details.
.TP
\fBEmergency\fR
Directives enclosed between
.B Emergency
and the following
.B End
directives define an emergency backend server (see below for
details). You may define only one emergency server per service, which
.B pound
will attempt to use if all backends are down.
.TP
.B Metrics
Special backend type that implements Openmetrics protocol output.  See
the section
.B Metrics
below for a detailed discussion.
.TP
\fBSession\fR
Directives enclosed between
.B Session
and
the following
.B End
directives define a session-tracking mechanism for the current
service. See below for details.
.SS Other directives
.TP
\fBIgnoreCase\fR \fIbool\fR
Override the global
.B IgnoreCase
setting.
.IP
This statement is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
Please, use the \fB\-icase\fR option to the \fBURL\fR directive
instead.  See the discussion of \fIoptions\fR in
.B Service Matching Directives
section above.
.TP
\fBDisabled\fR \fIbool\fR
Start
.B pound
with this service disabled (\fItrue\fR) or enabled (\fIfalse\fR). If
started as disabled, the service can be later enabled with
.BR poundctl (8).
.SH "ACME"
This statement creates a \fIservice\fR specially crafted for answering
ACME HTTP-01 challenge requests (see
.BR https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#http-01-challenge ).
It takes a single argument specifying a directory where ACME
challenges are stored.
.PP
It is supposed that another program is started
periodically, which checks for certificates approaching their
expiration, issues renewal requests and stores the obtained ACME
challenges in that directory.
.SH "Backend"
A backend is a definition of a single backend server
.B pound
will use to reply to incoming requests.  All configuration directives
enclosed between
.B Backend
and
.B End
are specific to a single backend. The following directives are available:
.TP
\fBAddress\fR \fIaddress\fR
The address that
.B pound
will connect to. This can be a numeric IP address, a symbolic host name
that must be resolvable at run-time, or a full pathname of a UNIX
socket. If the name cannot be resolved to a valid address,
.B pound
will assume that it represents the path for a Unix-domain socket. This is a
.B mandatory
parameter.
.TP
\fBPort\fR \fIport\fR
The port number or service name that
.B pound
will connect to. This is a
.B mandatory
parameter for non Unix-domain backends.
.TP
\fBHTTPS\fR
The backend is using HTTPS.
.TP
\fBCert\fR "\fIfilename\fR"
Specify the certificate that
.B pound
will use as a client. The
.I filename
is the file containing the certificate, possibly a certificate chain
and the signature.
This directive may appear only after the
.B HTTPS
directive.
.TP
\fBDisable\fR SSLv2|SSLv3|TLSv1|TLSv1_1|TLSv1_2
Disable the protocol \fBand all lower protocols as well\fR.
This is due to a limitation in OpenSSL, which does not support
disabling a single protocol. For example,
.B Disable TLSv1
would disable SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLSv1, thus allowing only TLSv1_1 and TLSv1_2.
This directive may appear only after the
.B HTTPS
directive.
.TP
\fBCiphers\fR "\fIcipherlist\fR"
This is the list of ciphers that will be accepted by the SSL
connection; it is a string in the same format as in OpenSSL
.BR ciphers (1)
and
.BR SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list (3).
This directive may appear only after the
.B HTTPS
directive.
.TP
\fBPriority\fR \fIn\fR
The priority of this backend (between 1 and 9, 5 is default). Higher priority
backends will be used more often than lower priority ones, so you should
define higher priorities for more capable servers.
.TP
\fBTimeOut\fR \fIn\fR
Override the global
.B TimeOut
value.
.TP
\fBConnTO\fR \fIn\fR
Override the global
.B ConnTO
value.
.TP
\fBWSTimeOut\fR \fIn\fR
Override the global
.B WSTimeOut
value.
.TP
\fBDisabled\fR \fIbool\fR
Start
.B pound
with this backend disabled (1) or enabled (0). If started as disabled, the
backend can be later enabled with
.BR poundctl (8).
.SH "Emergency"
The emergency server will be used once all existing backends are "dead".
All configuration directives enclosed between
.B Emergency
and
.B End
are specific to a single service. The following directives are available:
.TP
\fBAddress\fR \fIaddress\fR
The address that
.B pound
will connect to. This can be a numeric IP address, or a symbolic host name
that must be resolvable at run-time. If the name cannot be resolved to a valid
address,
.B pound
will assume that it represents the path for a Unix-domain socket. This is a
.B mandatory
parameter.
.TP
\fBPort\fR \fIport\fR
The port number that
.B pound
will connect to. This is a
.B mandatory
parameter for non Unix-domain backends.
.PP
Additionally, the following directives are also supported:
.BR TimeOut ,
.BR WSTimeOut ,
.BR ConnTO ,
.BR HTTPS ,
.BR Cert ,
.BR Ciphers ,
.BR Disable  .
These have the same meaning as in the
.B Backend
section, which see.
.SH "Session"
Defines how a service deals with possible HTTP sessions.  All configuration
directives enclosed between
.B Session
and
.B End
are specific to a single service. Once a session is identified,
.B pound
will attempt to send all requests within that session to the same backend
server.
.PP
The following directives are available:
.TP
\fBType\fR IP|BASIC|URL|PARM|COOKIE|HEADER
What kind of sessions are we looking for: IP (the client address), BASIC (basic
authentication), URL (a request parameter), PARM (a URI parameter), COOKIE (a
certain cookie), or HEADER (a certain request header).
This is a
.B mandatory
parameter.
.TP
\fBTTL\fR \fIn\fR
How long can a session be idle (in seconds). A session that has been idle for
longer than the specified number of seconds will be discarded.
This is a
.B mandatory
parameter.
.TP
\fBID\fR "\fIname\fR"
The session identifier. This directive is permitted only for sessions of type
URL (the name of the request parameter we need to track), COOKIE (the name of
the cookie) and HEADER (the header name).
.PP
See below for some examples.
.SH Metrics
The following service definition enables Openmetric telemetry output
on endpoint
.BR /metrics:
.PP
.EX
Service
    URL "/metrics"
    Metrics
End
.EE
.PP
To control access to the telemetry endpoint, use the
.B ACL
statement.
.PP
The metrics output is sufficiently self-documented by
.B # HELP
descriptor lines.
.SH HIGH-AVAILABILITY

attempts to keep track of active backend servers, and will temporarily disable
servers that do not respond (though not necessarily dead: an overloaded server
that
.B pound
cannot establish a connection to will be considered dead). However, every
.B Alive
seconds, an attempt is made to connect to the dead servers in case
they have become active again. If this attempt succeeds, connections
will be initiated to them again.
.PP
In general it is a good idea to set this time interval as low as is
consistent with your resources in order to benefit from resurrected
servers at the earliest possible time. The default value of 30 seconds
is probably a good choice.
.PP
The clients that happen to hit a dead backend server will just receive a
.I "503 Service Unavailable"
message.
.SH REQUEST MODIFICATION DIRECTIVES
Several statements are provided to modify the incoming requests prior
to passing them to the backend.  These statements can be present both in
.B ListenHTTP
.RB ( ListenHTTPS )
and in
.B Service
sections.
.PP
Basic request modification directives are:
.TP
\fBSetURL\fR "\fIvalue\fR"
Set the URL of the incoming request to \fIvalue\fR.
.TP
\fBSetPath\fR "\fIvalue\fR"
Set the path part of the URL to the given string.
.TP
\fBSetQuery\fR "\fIvalue\fR"
Set the query part of the URL to the given string.  \fIvalue\fR must be
a valid query with the special characters properly encoded using
percent encoding.
.TP
\fBSetQueryParam\fR "\fIname\fR" "\fIvalue\fR"
Set the query parameter \fIname\fR to the \fIvalue\fR.  Value must be
properly encoded if it contains reserved characters.
.TP
\fBSetHeader\fR "\fIname\fB: \fIvalue\fR"
Sets the HTTP header.  If the header \fIname\fR already exists, it
will be overwritten.  Otherwise, new header will be added to the end
of the header list.
.TP
\fBDeleteHeader\fR [\fIoptions\fR] "\fIpattern\fR"
Remove from the request all headers matchibg \fIpattern\fR.  By
default, \fIpattern\fR is treated as extended POSIX regular
expression.  One or more \fIoptions\fR can be supplied to modify
the default behavior.  The \fIoptions\fR argument in the above
directives can be used to select the comparison method.  It consists
of zero or more option flags from the following list:
.RS
.TP
.B \-re
Use regular expression matching.
.TP
.B \-exact
Use exact string matching.
.TP
.B \-beg
Exact match at the beginning of string (prefix match).
.TP
.B \-end
Exact match at the end of string (suffix match).
.TP
.B \-case
Case-sensitive comparison.
.TP
.B \-icase
Case-insensitive comparison.
.RE
.PP
The \fIvalue\fR argument in the above directives is subject to
.IR "request evaluation" ,
during which ny occurrence of
.I request accessors
found in it is replaced them with the values they produce.
Syntactically, a request accessor is:
.PP
.EX
\fB%[ \fINAME\fR [\fIARG\fR] \fB]\fR
.EE
.PP
where \fINAME\fR is the accessor name and \fIARG\fR is optional
argument.  Notice, that square brackets shown in bold are part
of the accessor, whereas those enclosing \fIARG\fR are used to
denote its optional nature.
.PP
The following accessors are defined:
.TP
.B url
Returns the URL part of the request.
.TP
.B path
Returns the path part of the request.
.TP
.B query
Returns the query part of the request.
.TP
.BI param " NAME"
Returns the value of the query parameter \fINAME\fR.
.TP
.BI header " NAME"
Returns the value of the HTTP header \fINAME\fR.
.PP
The
.B Rewrite
block statement is used to associate one or more of the above
directives with request matching directives (discussed in the subsection
.B Service Matching Directives
above), so that request modification takes place only when the request
matches certain conditions.
.PP
Syntactically, a
.B Rewrite
block is:
.PP
.EX
.B Rewrite
\&.
\&.
\&.
.B Else
\&.
\&.
\&.
.B End
.EE
.PP
where dots stand for any number of request matching and request
modification statements.  The \fBElse\fR part is optional; any number
of \fBElse\fR blocks can be supplied, thus providing for conditional branching.
The following concocted example illustrates it:
.PP
.EX
Rewrite
   Path "\\.(jpg|gif)$"
   SetPath "/images%[path]"
Else
   Match AND
     Host "example.org"
     Path "\\.[^.]+$"
   End
   SetPath "/static%[path]"
Else
   Path "\\.[^.]+$"
   SetPath "/assets%[path]"
End
.EE
.PP
Here, if a path ends with a filename with suffix ".jpg" or ".gif",
"/images" is prepended to it (notice that path always starts with
a slash, hence it should not be used explicitly).  If the path ends
with any other extension, the action depends on the host being
addressed.  The path is prefixed with "/static" if the host is
"example.org", and with "/assets" otherwise.
.PP
When used in this context, arguments to request modification
directives are also subject to
.I backreference expansion
similar to that discussed in the description of the \fBRedirect\fR
statement, in section
.B Service
above.  To illustrate this, here's the
above example rewritten using backreferences instead of accessors:
.PP
.EX
Rewrite
   Path ".*\\.(jpg|gif)$"
   SetPath "/images$0"
Else
   Match AND
     Host "example.org"
     Path ".*\\.[^.]+$"
   End
   SetPath "/static$0"
Else
   Path ".*\\.[^.]+$"
   SetPath "/assets$0"
End
.EE
.PP
Request modification directives are applied in the same order as they
appear in the configuration file.
.SH BUILT-IN HEADERS
In addition to the \fBSetHeader\fR and \fBDeleteHeader\fR directives
discussed above, the \fBHeaderOption\fR directive controls insertion
of the built-in headers:
.TP
\fBHeaderOption\fR \fIopt\fR...
.PP
There are two kinds of such headers: \fIforwarded\fR headers that
convey information about original destination of the request, and
\fIssl\fR headers (for \fBHTTPS\fR connections), that hold information
about server and client SSL certificates.  These are discussed in detail below.
.PP
By default, both kinds of built-in additional headers are enabled.
This default can be changed by using the \fBHeaderOption\fR directive.
Placed in global scope, this directive sets global options.  Used
within a \fBListenHTTP\fR or \fBListenHTTPS\fR block, it affects only
settings for that listener.
.PP
The \fIopt\fR values passed to the directive are:
.TP
.B none
Disable both kinds of additional headers.
.TP
.B forwarded
Enable forwarded headers.
.TP
.B no\-forwarded
Disable forwarded headers.
.TP
.B ssl
Enable ssl headers.
.TP
.B no\-ssl
Disable ssl headers.
.PP
The built-in headers are added before request modification directives
are applied.  Thus, you can use
.B DeleteHeader
and
.B SetHeader
to trim down headers added by
.BR HeaderOptions .
.SS Forwarded Headers
The headers in the \fIforwarded\fR header group are:
.TP
.B X\-Forwarded\-For
The IP address of the HTTP client that sent the request,
.TP
.B X\-Forwarded\-Proto
The protocol (\fBhttp\fR or \fBhttps\fR) that the client used to
connect to
.BR pound .
.TP
.B X\-Forwarded\-Port
Destination port that the client used to connect to
.BR pound .
.SS HTTPS Headers
If a client browser connects to
.B pound
via HTTPS and the \fIssl\fR header group is enabled, then the
following header is added:
.TP
.B X\-SSL\-Cipher
Contains SSL version followed by a slash and active cipher algorithm.
.PP
Additionally, if the client presented its certificate,
the following headers are added that describe the client certificate:
.TP
.B X\-SSL\-Subject
Details about the certificate owner.
.TP
.B X\-SSL\-Issuer
Details about the certificate issuer (Certificate Authority).
.TP
.B X\-SSL\-NotBefore
Starting date of certificate validity.
.TP
.B X\-SSL\-NotAfter
Ending date of certificate validity.
.TP
.B X\-SSL\-Serial
Certificate serial number (decimal).
.TP
.B X\-SSL\-Certificate
The full client certificate (PEM-format multi-line)
.SH SECURITY
.PP
In general,
.B pound
does not read or write to the hard-disk. The exceptions are reading
the configuration file and (possibly) the server certificate file(s)
and error message(s), which are opened read-only on startup, read, and
closed, and the pid file which is opened on start-up, written to and
immediately closed. Following this there is no disk access whatsoever,
so using a \fBRootJail\fR directive is only for extra security bonus points.
.PP
.B Pound
tries to sanitize all HTTP/HTTPS requests: the request itself, the
headers and the contents are checked for conformance to the RFC's and
only valid requests are passed to the backend servers. This is not
absolutely fool-proof - as the recent Apache problem with chunked
transfers demonstrated. However, given the current standards, this is
the best that can be done - HTTP is an inherently weak protocol.
.SH DEPRECATED FEATURES
.SS Configuration statements
The following configuration statements are retained for backward
compatibility with earlier
.B pound
versions.  They will disappear from future releases:
.TP
.B HeadRequire
Use
.B Header
instead.  See
.BR "Service Matching Directives" ,
for details.
.TP
.B HeadDeny
Use
.BR "Not Header" .
For details, see the
.B Negation
subsection in
.BR "Service Matching Directives" .
.TP
.BR AddHeader " and " HeaderAdd
Use
.B SetHeader
instead.  See the section
.BR "REQUEST MODIFICATION DIRECTIVES" ,
for details.
.TP
.B IgnoreCase
Use the \fB\-icase\fR option to the \fBURL\fR directive
instead.  See the discussion of \fIoptions\fR in the
.B Service Matching Directives
section.
.SS Redirect request hack
The use of the \fIredirect request\fR hack in the \fBRedirect\fR
statement is deprecated as well.
Instead of relying on the trailing slash to append the original URL
to the redirect location, use URL backreferences.  For example,
instead of
.PP
.EX
  Redirect "http://example.org/"
.EE
.PP
use:
.PP
.EX
  URL ".*"
  Redirect "http://example.org$0"
.EE
.SS Multiple redirect backends
Use of multiple \fBRedirect\fR backends in a single service is
deprecated, as well as using  \fBRedirect\fR backends together with
regular ones.  If you know of any valid usage for such configuration,
please drop a note to the authors (see
.BR "REPORTING BUGS" ,
below).
.SH ADDITIONAL NOTES
.B Pound
uses the system log for messages (default facility \fBLOG_DAEMON\fR).
If using
.BR rsyslog ,
you can use the following configuration fragment to redirect
.B pound
messages to a separate file:
.PP
.EX
:programname, startswith, "pound" {
  /var/log/pound.log
  stop
}
.EE
.PP
The format requested by
.B "LogLevel 3"
is understood by most log analyzers.
.PP
Translating HTTPS to HTTP is an iffy proposition: no client
information is passed to the server itself (certificates, etc) and the
backend server may be misled if it uses absolute URLs.
.B Pound
tries to handle this by adding various
.B X\-Forwarded\-*
and
.B X\-SSL\-*
headers.  See
.B "HEADER MODIFICATION"
above, for a detailed discussion.
.PP
.B Pound
deals with (and sanitizes) HTTP/1.1 requests. Thus even if you have an
HTTP/1.0 server, a single connection to an HTTP/1.1 client is kept,
while the connection to the backend server is re-opened as necessary.
.PP
.B Pound
attempts to resolve the names of the hosts that appear in various
requests and/or responses.  That means it needs a functioning resolver
of some kind (be it
.BR /etc/hosts ,
DNS or something else).
However, the use of DNS can be disabled using the
.B \-W no\-dns
command line option.
.SH EXAMPLES
To translate HTTPS requests to a local HTTP server (assuming your
network address is 192.0.2.1):
.PP
.EX
ListenHTTPS
    Address 192.0.2.1
    Port    443
    Cert    "/etc/pound/server.pem"
    Service
        Backend
            Address 127.0.0.1
            Port    80
        End
    End
End
.EE
.PP
To distribute the HTTP/HTTPS requests to three Web servers, where the third one
is a newer and faster machine:
.PP
.EX
ListenHTTP
    Address 192.0.2.1
    Port    80
End

ListenHTTPS
    Address 192.0.2.1
    Port    443
    Cert    "/etc/pound/server.pem"
End

Service
    Backend
        Address 192.168.0.10
        Port    80
    End

    Backend
        Address 192.168.0.11
        Port    80
    End

    Backend
        Address 192.168.0.12
        Port    80
        Priority 3
    End
End
.EE
.PP
To separate between image requests and other Web content and send all requests
for a specific URL to a secure server:
.PP
.EX
ListenHTTP
    Address 192.0.2.1
    Port    80
End

# Images server(s)
Service
    URL ".*.(jpg|gif)"
    Backend
        Address 192.168.0.12
        Port    80
    End
End

# redirect all requests for /forbidden

Service
    Url         -beg "/forbidden"
    Redirect    "https://xyzzy.com"
End

# Catch-all server(s)
Service
    Backend
        Address 192.168.0.10
        Port    80
    End

    Backend
        Address 192.168.0.11
        Port    80
    End

    Session
        Type    BASIC
        TTL     300
    End
End
.EE
.PP
Here is a more complex example: assume your static images (GIF/JPEG)
are to be served from a single backend 192.168.0.10. In addition,
192.168.0.11 is to do the hosting for \fIwww.myserver.com\fR with
URL-based sessions.  Two backends, 192.168.0.20 and 192.168.0.21,
will handle the rest of requests (cookie-based sessions).  Among
these, the latter (192.168.0.21) is less powerful than the former,
so care should be taken that it gets less requests.  The logging will
be done by backend servers.  All plain HTTP requests are to be
redirected to HTTPS and all requests directed to \fImyserver.com\fR -
to \fIwww.myserver.com\fR.  The configuration file may look like this:
.PP
.EX
User        "nobody"
Group       "nogroup"
RootJail    "/var/pound/jail"
Alive       60
LogLevel    0

# HTTP: redirect all requests to the corresponding HTTPS server.
ListenHTTP
    Address 192.0.2.1
    Port    80
    Client  10
    Service
        Host -re ".+"
        URL ".*"
        Redirect 301 "https://$0(1)$0"
    End
End

ListenHTTPS
    Address 192.0.2.1
    Port    443
    Cert    "/etc/pound/pound.pem"
    Client  20
End

.SH FILES
.TP
.B /var/run/pound.pid
This is where

.TP
.B /usr/local/etc/pound/cert.pem
the certificate file(s) for HTTPS. The location must be defined in the configuration
