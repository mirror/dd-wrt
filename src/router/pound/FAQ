FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

1. General
==========

1.1 Will Pound run my Web application?

    No. Pound is a proxy, not a Web server - it does not deliver content by
    itself. It is just the middle-man between a client and a server.

1.2 Will Pound make my server go faster?

    No. Pound is just a proxy - no caching of any kind takes place. Pound
    IS able to distribute requests between several back-end servers, thus
    allowing for faster overall response times, but it won't speed-up a
    single Web sever.

1.3 Will Pound make my server more secure?

    Probably yes. Pound has its own checks on the validity of HTTP requests
    and often catches malicious requests that are used to attack Web servers.

1.4 Can I use Pound to change/rewrite/redirect requests?

    No. Pound tries to be as transparent as possible - ideally a client
    should not be aware that there is anything between itself and the actual
    Web server. A limited form of redirects are available - see the man page.

1.5 Can I use Pound to deny certain requests?

    Yes. Pound has quite a good mechanism for classifying requests and it
    can deny/reject certain requests based on URL and/or header content.


2. Configuration, Compilation and Installation
==============================================

2.1 I try to compile and it fails on "needs OpenSSL with thread support"

    Pound is a multi-threaded program and it needs an OpenSSL library
    compiled with thread support (optional in the OpenSSL configuration and
    absent in some default installations, such as *BSD). If your default
    library does not support threads you must install a thread-enabled
    version.

2.2 Pound compiles correctly but crashes on *BSD

    On some of the newer versions of *BSD (FreeBSD 5.x, OpenBSD 3.x) the
    Pound autoconf may not correctly recognize the threading library. Add
    manually to the generated Makefile the option -DNEED_STACK in the
    CFLAGS.

2.3 I want to run Pound with daemon-tools but it goes to background

    You need to configure Pound for non-daemon operations: add "Daemon 0"
    to the config file.

2.4 Pound runs OK but some normal requests are rejected with "bad URL"

    Pound checks the requested URLs quite thoroughly and rejects malformed
    or illegal URLs - or at least illegal according to the RFCs. See the
    man page for details.

2.5 Pound runs OK but I get a "pthread_create" error message

    You may be hitting the system limit on the number of processes. On
    systems that implement threads as processes (as Linux does) you should
    make sure that the Pound process has permission to start a sufficient
    number of processes.

    In some rare cases you may be running into the system limit on the
    number of threads. Check your system details for the value of
    PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX. If needed you must recompile the threads library
    with a higher value.

2.6 What resources does Pound need/use?

    That depends very much on your system. On some systems, such as Linux
    and System V (AIX, HP-UX, etc), threads are implemented as processes,
    which means you must allow enough processes to run. On other systems,
    such as *BSD, where threads are implemented in user space (in-process),
    you should make sure that Pound can use sufficient memory for all the
    threads and that the process is allowed to use enough file descriptors
    (2 per active connection). Finally, on systems that implement threads
    natively, such as Solaris, you need to make sure that enough threads
    and open file descriptors are allowed.

2.7 Is NPTL supported?

    Theoretically Pound will work with any POSIX-compliant threads package.
    In practice some of the newer NPTL implementations still have some
    bugs. At least on Linux running Pound with LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.19
    may be helpful.


3. Virtual Hosts
================

3.1 How do I redirect specific virtual hosts to specific back-ends?

    Make the virtual host mandatory in the UrlGroup. For example, to have
    all requests to www.a.com go to 192.168.0.10 and all requests for
    www.b.com go to 192.168.0.20, define

        Service
            HeadRequire "Host:.*www.a.com.*"
            BackEnd
                Address 192.168.0.10
                Port    80
            End
        End

        Service
            HeadRequire "Host:.*www.b.com.*"
            BackEnd
                Address 192.168.0.20
                Port    80
            End
        End

    in your config file.

3.2 How do I redirect requests to specific back-ends based on the client
    address?

    You can do it easier via the packet filter you use. If you insist on
    having Pound do it use a combination of port redirection and separate
    instances of Pound for each port. For example, assume you want intranet
    clients (on 192.168.100.0/24) to use the server at 192.168.1.10 and
    external clients go to 192.168.1.20. Do the following:

        - redirect requests from 192.168.100.0/24 to port 8080

            pf: rdr on rl0 from 192.168.100.0/24 to 192.168.100.1 port 80 \
                -> localhost port 8080

            netfilter: iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp \
                -s 192.168.100.0/24 --dport 80 -i eth0 -j DNAT \
                --to localhost:8080

        - redirect requests from anywhere else to port 8081

            pf: rdr on rl0 from any to 192.168.100.1 port 80 \
                -> localhost port 8081

            netfilter: iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp \
                --dport 80 -i eth0 -j DNAT --to localhost:8081

        - have a Pound listener on port 8080 and sending the
          requests to 192.168.1.10

        - have a Pound listener on port 8081 and sending the
          requests to 192.168.1.20

3.3 What happens when my server replies with a redirect?

    Depending on configuration, Pound can watch for redirect replies from back-ends
    and change them to the correct address. In order for this to happen the
    following conditions must be met:

    - Pound has "Check30x 1"
    - the back-end replies with a redirect. The address of that URL resolves to
      the same address as the one Pound is listening on or the address of the
      back-end itself.

    This feature is commonly used when Pound serves as a HTTPS wrapper,
    as the backend redirect to "Location: http://x.y.com" is rewritten as
    "Location: https://x.y.com".


4. HTTPS
========

4.1 Can I have Pound force HTTPS connections to certain URLs/back-ends?

    Yes - define a Service with a Redirect back-end.

4.2 How can I do virtual hosting with HTTPS?

    The simple answer is that neither you, nor anybody else can, due to a
    limitation of the HTTPS protocol. In its simplest form an HTTPS (SSL)
    connection goes through the following stages:

    - negotiation: the client contacts the server, receives a certificate
      from it, and negotiates the protocol details (cipher parameters, etc).

    - authentication: the client checks that the certificate received matches
      the server it wanted and validates that the certificate is correct as
      attested by some certificate authority.

    - request/response: normal HTTP, encrypted in transit.

    As you can see the certificate is sent before any request was received.
    Unfortunately, the first request specifies the virtual host that the
    client would like to talk to - and it may not match the server name in
    the certificate.

4.3 Pound does not start with message "can't read private key"

    The file you specify in the ListenHTTPS directive must contain both the
    server certificate and the private key to it in PEM format. See the man
    page for SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(3) for details.

4.4 How can a back-end know that the connection is via HTTPS?

    Pound can add a header for incoming requests indicating that they were
    received via HTTPS. See the details on AddHeader in the man page.

4.5 HTTPS connections fail when Pound runs chrooted

    The OpenSSL library requires access to /dev/urandom for its random seed.
    The normal device is not accessible in a jail root. You should add a
    link to the device to make it accessible. On Linux this would be:

        mknod /var/pound/dev/urandom c 1 9

    assuming that /var/pound is the root jail.

4.6 How can I force a back-end to generate the correct URL with HTTPS

    There is no simple answer to this question - each server and application
    have their own way of doing things. If your server does not use absolute
    paths then all is well - things will run out of the box. However if some
    frames, images, links or a base tag are generated with an absolute path
    you must find a way to force the generation with https://.

4.7 How can I find out about the client certificate in my application?

    For requests via HTTPS connections Pound can add the details of the
    client certificate as headers to each and every request it passes to
    the back-end. See the details on HTTPSHeaders in the man page.

4.8 Can Pound use my crypto accelerator hardware?

    Pound supports the OpenSSL engine architecture. If your crypto card is
    supported by OpenSSL then it is supported by Pound. See the SSLEngine
    directive in the man page.

4.9 Can Pound use HTTPS back-end servers?

    No, that is not supported: such a connection would break a lot of things,
    either security (Pound would effectively act as a man-in-the-middle,
    breaking the end-to-end integrity of SSL) or functionality (if Pound
    would just pass encrypted data back and forth things like session
    tracking and validity checking would be impossible). This means that
    such support is unlikely to ever be part of Pound.


5. Session tracking
===================

5.1 Can I have session tracking based on URL and/or Cookie?

    Pound can track sessions based on client IP address, a cookie, an URL
    parameter or BasicAuthentication. These options are mutually exclusive -
    only one of them can be used per UrlGroup.

5.2 When does a session expire?

    A session is kept for the specified number of seconds. If during this
    time no new request was received the session is discarded.

5.3 Does Pound create/track its own sessions?

    No. Pound does not add anything to the requests or the responses - it
    uses the tokens generated by the back-end servers exclusively.


6. Logging
==========

6.1 Can I use Webalizer on Pound log files?

    Yes. If you use LogLevel 3 or 4 Pound uses one of the standard log
    formats that are recognized by applications such as Webalizer. You will
    have to remove the time-stamp generated by the syslog - see cut(1) for
    details.

6.2 How do I log the original client address in the back-end log?

    Pound adds the X-Forwarded-for header with the original client address
    to every request. Use it for your logs on the back-end servers.

6.3 How can I separate the Pound log from other syslog messages?

    If you use the syslog facility you can configure it to send the pound
    messages to a separate file. You may want to separate by severity as
    well - normal log messages use LOG_INFO, everything else is not request
    information. See syslogd(8) for details on how to configure it.

6.4 How can I separate error messages from normal log messages?

    If you use syslog: normal requests are logged at LOG_INFO, everything
    else is higher.

    If you run without syslog: normal request logging to stdout, everything
    else to stderr.

6.5 Why does Pound not log anything when chrooted?

    On some systems you need access to /dev/log in order to use the syslog(8)
    facility. Create the device as needed in the root jail you use.

6.6 Why can't Pound log directly to a file?

    This is a security requirement. As things stand, Pound does not write at
    all to the disk. The existing tools - such as syslog - allow all the
    flexibility one could wish for.

    If you absolutely must you can try the patches from Shinji Tanaka (see
    http://www.hatena-inc.co.jp/~stanaka/pound/ for details).


7. WebDAV
=========

7.1 I compiled Pound with DAV support but it still rejects the requests

    You also need to define "WebDAV 1" in your config file, and (depending on
    your server or application) "xHTTP 1" as well.

7.3 Can I use Pound as a front-end for Subversion?

    Yes. You may have some problems with using it via HTTPS, but HTTP should
    work.


8. Zope
=======

8.1 What configurations is Pound most helpful for?

    If you have several servers running on top of a ZEO server, Pound will
    allow you to load-balance between them (BTW, this was the original
    motivation for developing Pound). Pound also makes for a very good,
    light-weight front-end for a single Zope - exposing the Zope Web-server
    directly on the big, bad Internet is not a very good idea.

8.2 Can I have virtual hosts in Zope without Apache?

    Yes. Despite persistent rumors, the Virtual Host Monster works perfectly
    well on its own (dark incantations at midnight under the shade of the
    cross-shaped oak branch are NOT required). All you need to do is to
    add a VHM in the Zope root, click on the Mappings tab and add whatever
    hosts you need.

8.3 Can I have HTTPS for Zope?

    Yes. Pound will happily pass SSL requests to Zope. You have three possible
    methods to force Zope to generate responses with the https:// prefix:

    - if all you need is a specific area to be accessible only through HTTPS
      you can add a SiteRoot with the correct name.

    - alternately the Pound distribution includes patches for z2.py that
      include a new -y flag for a "https://" port.

    - finally, for version 2.7 or later you can set it in zope.conf.

8.4 Can I force HTTPS for certain areas in Zope?

    Yes. Add a check for the SSL-specific headers in the dtml_header or
    whatever equivalent you use. See the details on HTTPSHeaders in the man
    page.


9. Miscellaneous/MS
===================

9.1 IE fails to connect to Pound via HTTPS

    Define the ciphers to be
    
        "ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP:+eNULL"

    in the config file. We have had reports of IE problems with other
    ciphers.

9.2 IE has big delays in getting replies from Pound

    Try a shorter Client timeout. IE uses exactly 4 sockets, and as long as
    they stay open it won't do anything else. A short Client value will
    force the socket(s) to be closed earlier, thus avoiding annoying waits.

9.3 I try to run MS OWA and Pound rejects the requests

    Make sure you configured Pound with --enable-msdav. Make sure you
    included "WebDAV 1" in the config file. Pray that MS would adhere to
    some known standard. Repeat as necessary.

9.4 How can I force OWA to accept HTTPS requests?

    Make sure to define

        AddHeader   "Front-End-Https: on"

    in the config file. This will force OWA to generate the responses with
    the correct protocol.
