# Configuration is in @bridgestpconffile@
#
# `/sbin/bridge-stp <bridge> <start|stop>` is called by the kernel when STP is
# enabled/disabled on a bridge (via `brctl stp <bridge> <on|off>` or
# `ip link set <bridge> type bridge stp_state <0|1>`).  The kernel
# enables user_stp mode if that command returns 0, or enables kernel_stp mode if
# that command returns any other value.
#
# If called with the above arguments, this script determines whether MSTP should
# be used for the specified bridge (based on the "MSTP_BRIDGES" configuration
# value), starts/stops mstpd if necessary, and calls
# `mstpctl <addbridge|delbridge> <bridge>` to add/remove the bridge from mstpd
# (possibly in a background job after a delay; see the comments in the code
# below).  No further configuration is performed automatically by this script at
# that time.  Additional configuration is usually performed by
# @ifupdownfile@ (which calls `ip link set <bridge> type bridge stp_state 1`
# to trigger this script to start mstpd if necessary).
#
# This script is not intended to be called with the above arguments directly
# (not via the kernel).  However, this script may be called directly as
# `mstpctl_restart_config` or `/sbin/bridge-stp restart_config` to reconfigure
# (using `@configbridgefile@ <bridge>` or an alternative command specified using
# a "config_cmd" configuration value) all existing bridges that are using mstpd,
# or called as `mstp_restart` or `/sbin/bridge-stp restart` to restart mstpd and
# then reconfigure all bridges that are using it.
#
# To avoid kernel deadlocks, this script (and any foreground processes it runs)
# must not make any changes (using brctl, ifconfig, ip, /sys/..., etc) to the
# bridge or any associated kernel network interfaces in any code paths that are
# used when this script is called by the kernel.
