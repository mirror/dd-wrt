1 Introduction
**************

All symbols defined in the public API start with ‘MHD_’.  MHD is a small
HTTP daemon library.  As such, it does not have any API for logging
errors (you can only enable or disable logging to stderr).  Also, it may
not support all of the HTTP features directly, where applicable,
portions of HTTP may have to be handled by clients of the library.

   The library is supposed to handle everything that it must handle
(because the API would not allow clients to do this), such as basic
connection management.  However, detailed interpretations of headers,
such as range requests, are left to the main application.  In
particular, if an application developer wants to support range requests,
he needs to explicitly indicate support in responses and also explicitly
parse the range header and generate a response (for example, using the
‘MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset’ call to serve ranges from a
file).  MHD does understands headers that control connection management
(specifically, ‘Connection: close’ and ‘Expect: 100 continue’ are
understood and handled automatically).  ‘Connection: upgrade’ is
supported by passing control over the socket (or something that behaves
like the real socket in the case of TLS) to the application (after
sending the desired HTTP response header).

   MHD largely ignores the semantics of the different HTTP methods, so
clients are left to handle those.  One exception is that MHD does
understand ‘HEAD’ and will only send the headers of the response and not
the body, even if the client supplied a body.  (In fact, clients do need
to construct a response with the correct length, even for ‘HEAD’
request.)

   MHD understands ‘POST’ data and is able to decode certain formats (at
the moment only ‘application/x-www-form-urlencoded’ and
‘multipart/form-data’) using the post processor API. The data stream of
a POST is also provided directly to the main application, so unsupported
encodings could still be processed, just not conveniently by MHD.

   The header file defines various constants used by the HTTP protocol.
This does not mean that MHD actually interprets all of these values.
The provided constants are exported as a convenience for users of the
library.  MHD does not verify that transmitted HTTP headers are part of
the standard specification; users of the library are free to define
their own extensions of the HTTP standard and use those with MHD.

   All functions are guaranteed to be completely reentrant and
thread-safe.  MHD checks for allocation failures and tries to recover
gracefully (for example, by closing the connection).  Additionally,
clients can specify resource limits on the overall number of
connections, number of connections per IP address and memory used per
connection to avoid resource exhaustion.

1.1 Scope
=========

MHD is currently used in a wide range of implementations.  Examples
based on reports we’ve received from developers include:
   • Embedded HTTP server on a cortex M3 (128 KB code space)
   • Large-scale multimedia server (reportedly serving at the simulator
     limit of 7.5 GB/s)
   • Administrative console (via HTTP/HTTPS) for network appliances

1.2 Thread modes and event loops
================================

MHD supports four basic thread modes and up to three event loop styles.

   The four basic thread modes are external sockets polling (MHD creates
no threads, event loop is fully managed by the application), internal
polling (MHD creates one thread for all connections), polling in thread
pool (MHD creates a thread pool which is used to process all
connections) and thread-per-connection (MHD creates one thread for
listen sockets and then one thread per accepted connection).

   These thread modes are then combined with the evet loop styles
(polling function type).  MHD support select, poll and epoll.  select is
available on all platforms, epoll and poll may not be available on some
platforms.  Note that it is possible to combine MHD using epoll with an
external select-based event loop.

   The default (if no other option is passed) is “external select”.  The
highest performance can typically be obtained with a thread pool using
‘epoll’.  Apache Benchmark (ab) was used to compare the performance of
‘select’ and ‘epoll’ when using a thread pool and a large number of
connections.  *note Figure 1.1: fig:performance. shows the resulting
plot from the ‘benchmark.c’ example, which measures the latency between
an incoming request and the completion of the transmission of the
response.  In this setting, the ‘epoll’ thread pool with four threads
was able to handle more than 45,000 connections per second on loopback
(with Apache Benchmark running three processes on the same machine).

Figure 1.1: Performance measurements for select vs.  epoll (with
thread-pool).

   Not all combinations of thread modes and event loop styles are
supported.  This is partially to keep the API simple, and partially
because some combinations simply make no sense as others are strictly
superior.  Note that the choice of style depends first of all on the
application logic, and then on the performance requirements.
Applications that perform a blocking operation while handling a request
within the callbacks from MHD must use a thread per connection.  This is
typically rather costly.  Applications that do not support threads or
that must run on embedded devices without thread-support must use the
external mode.  Using ‘epoll’ is only supported on some platform, thus
portable applications must at least have a fallback option available.
*note Table 1.1: tbl:supported. lists the sane combinations.

                        select   poll   epoll
external                yes      no     yes
internal                yes      yes    yes
thread pool             yes      yes    yes
thread-per-connection   yes      yes    no

1.3 Compiling GNU libmicrohttpd
===============================

MHD uses the standard GNU system where the usual build process involves
running
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

   MHD supports various options to be given to configure to tailor the
binary to a specific situation.  Note that some of these options will
remove portions of the MHD code that are required for
binary-compatibility.  They should only be used on embedded systems with
tight resource constraints and no concerns about library versioning.
Standard distributions including MHD are expected to always ship with
all features enabled, otherwise unexpected incompatibilities can arise!

   Here is a list of MHD-specific options that can be given to configure
(canonical configure options such as “–prefix” are also supported, for a
full list of options run “./configure –help”):

‘``--disable-curl''’
     disable running testcases using libcurl

‘``--disable-largefile''’
     disable support for 64-bit files

‘``--disable-messages''’
     disable logging of error messages (smaller binary size, not so much
     fun for debugging)

‘``--disable-https''’
     disable HTTPS support, even if GNUtls is found; this option must be
     used if eCOS license is desired as an option (in all cases the
     resulting binary falls under a GNU LGPL-only license)

‘``--disable-postprocessor''’
     do not include the post processor API (results in binary
     incompatibility)

‘``--disable-dauth''’
     do not include the authentication APIs (results in binary
     incompatibility)

‘``--disable-httpupgrade''’
     do not build code for HTTP “Upgrade” (smaller binary size, binary
     incompatible library)

‘``--disable-epoll''’
     do not include epoll support, even if it supported (minimally
     smaller binary size, good for portability testing)

‘``--enable-coverage''’
     set flags for analysis of code-coverage with gcc/gcov (results in
     slow, large binaries)

‘``--with-threads=posix,w32,none,auto''’
     sets threading library to use.  With use “none” to not support
     threads.  In this case, MHD will only support the “external”
     threading modes and not perform any locking of data structures!
     Use ‘MHD_is_feature_supported(MHD_FEATURE_THREADS)’ to test if
     threads are available.  Default is “auto”.

‘``--with-gcrypt=PATH''’
     specifies path to libgcrypt installation

‘``--with-gnutls=PATH''’
     specifies path to libgnutls installation

   To cross-compile MHD for Android, install the Android NDK and use:
./configure --target=arm-linux-androideabi --host=arm-linux-androideabi --disable-doc --disable-examples
make

   Similar build commands should work for cross-compilation to other
platforms.  Note that you may have to first cross-compile GnuTLS to get
MHD with TLS support.

1.4 Validity of pointers
========================

MHD will give applications access to its internal data structures via
pointers via arguments and return values from its API. This creates the
question as to how long those pointers are assured to stay valid.

   Most MHD data structures are associated with the connection of an
HTTP client.  Thus, pointers associated with a connection are typically
valid until the connection is finished, at which point MHD will call the
‘MHD_RequestCompletedCallback’ if one is registered.  Applications that
have such a callback registered may assume that keys and values from the
‘MHD_KeyValueIterator’, return values from ‘MHD_lookup_connection_value’
and the ‘url’, ‘method’ and ‘version’ arguments to the
‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback’ will remain valid until the respective
‘MHD_RequestCompletedCallback’ is invoked.

   In contrast, the ‘upload_data’ argument of
‘MHD_RequestCompletedCallback’ as well as all pointers from the
‘MHD_PostDataIterator’ are only valid for the duration of the callback.

   Pointers returned from ‘MHD_get_response_header’ are valid as long as
the response itself is valid.

1.5 Including the microhttpd.h header
=====================================

Ideally, before including "microhttpd.h" you should add the necessary
includes to define the ‘uint64_t’, ‘size_t’, ‘fd_set’, ‘socklen_t’ and
‘struct sockaddr’ data types.  Which specific headers are needed may
depend on your platform and your build system might include some tests
to provide you with the necessary conditional operations.  For possible
suggestions consult ‘platform.h’ and ‘configure.ac’ in the MHD
distribution.

   Once you have ensured that you manually (!)  included the right
headers for your platform before "microhttpd.h", you should also add a
line with ‘#define MHD_PLATFORM_H’ which will prevent the "microhttpd.h"
header from trying (and, depending on your platform, failing) to include
the right headers.

   If you do not define MHD_PLATFORM_H, the "microhttpd.h" header will
automatically include headers needed on GNU/Linux systems (possibly
causing problems when porting to other platforms).

1.6 SIGPIPE
===========

MHD does not install a signal handler for SIGPIPE. On platforms where
this is possible (such as GNU/Linux), it disables SIGPIPE for its I/O
operations (by passing MSG_NOSIGNAL or similar).  On other platforms,
SIGPIPE signals may be generated from network operations by MHD and will
cause the process to die unless the developer explicitly installs a
signal handler for SIGPIPE.

   Hence portable code using MHD must install a SIGPIPE handler or
explicitly block the SIGPIPE signal.  MHD does not do so in order to
avoid messing with other parts of the application that may need to
handle SIGPIPE in a particular way.  You can make your application
handle SIGPIPE by calling the following function in ‘main’:

static void
catcher (int sig)
{
}

static void
ignore_sigpipe ()
{
  struct sigaction oldsig;
  struct sigaction sig;

  sig.sa_handler = &catcher;
  sigemptyset (&sig.sa_mask);
#ifdef SA_INTERRUPT
  sig.sa_flags = SA_INTERRUPT;  /* SunOS */
#else
  sig.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;
#endif
  if (0 != sigaction (SIGPIPE, &sig, &oldsig))
    fprintf (stderr,
             "Failed to install SIGPIPE handler: %s\n", strerror (errno));
}

1.7 MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG
==========================

Some platforms do not support ‘long long’.  Hence MHD defines a macro
‘MHD_UNSIGNED LONG_LONG’ which will default to ‘unsigned long long’.
For standard desktop operating systems, this is all you need to know.

   However, if your platform does not support ‘unsigned long long’, you
should change "platform.h" to define ‘MHD_LONG_LONG’ and
‘MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG’ to an appropriate alternative type and also
define ‘MHD_LONG_LONG_PRINTF’ and ‘MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG_PRINTF’ to the
corresponding format string for printing such a data type.  Note that
the “signed” versions are deprecated.  Also, for historical reasons,
‘MHD_LONG_LONG_PRINTF’ is without the percent sign, whereas
‘MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG_PRINTF’ is with the percent sign.  Newly written
code should only use the unsigned versions.  However, you need to define
both in "platform.h" if you need to change the definition for the
specific platform.

1.8 Portability to W32
======================

libmicrohttpd in general ported well to W32.  Most libmicrohttpd
features are supported.  W32 do not support some functions, like epoll
and corresponding MHD features are not available on W32.

1.9 Portability to z/OS
=======================

To compile MHD on z/OS, extract the archive and run

iconv -f UTF-8 -t IBM-1047 contrib/ascebc > /tmp/ascebc.sh
chmod +x /tmp/ascebc.sh
for n in `find * -type f`
do
  /tmp/ascebc.sh $n
done
   to convert all source files to EBCDIC. Note that you must run
‘configure’ from the directory where the configure script is located.
Otherwise, configure will fail to find the ‘contrib/xcc’ script (which
is a wrapper around the z/OS c89 compiler).

2 Constants
***********

 -- Enumeration: MHD_FLAG
     Options for the MHD daemon.

     Note that MHD will run automatically in background thread(s) only
     if ‘MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD’ is used.  Otherwise caller
     (application) must use ‘MHD_run’ or ‘MHD_run_from_select’ to have
     MHD processed network connections and data.

     Starting the daemon may also fail if a particular option is not
     implemented or not supported on the target platform (i.e.  no
     support for TLS, threads or IPv6).  TLS support generally depends
     on options given during MHD compilation.

     ‘MHD_NO_FLAG’
          No options selected.

     ‘MHD_USE_ERROR_LOG’
          If this flag is used, the library should print error messages
          and warnings to stderr (or to custom error printer if it’s
          specified by options).  Note that for this run-time option to
          have any effect, MHD needs to be compiled with messages
          enabled.  This is done by default except you ran configure
          with the ‘--disable-messages’ flag set.

     ‘MHD_USE_DEBUG’
          Currently the same as ‘MHD_USE_ERROR_LOG’.

     ‘MHD_USE_TLS’
          Run in HTTPS-mode.  If you specify ‘MHD_USE_TLS’ and MHD was
          compiled without SSL support, ‘MHD_start_daemon’ will return
          NULL.

     ‘MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION’
          Run using one thread per connection.

     ‘MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD’
          Run using an internal thread doing ‘SELECT’.

     ‘MHD_USE_IPv6’
          Run using the IPv6 protocol (otherwise, MHD will just support
          IPv4).  If you specify ‘MHD_USE_IPV6’ and the local platform
          does not support it, ‘MHD_start_daemon’ will return NULL.

          If you want MHD to support IPv4 and IPv6 using a single
          socket, pass MHD_USE_DUAL_STACK, otherwise, if you only pass
          this option, MHD will try to bind to IPv6-only (resulting in
          no IPv4 support).

     ‘MHD_USE_DUAL_STACK’
          Use a single socket for IPv4 and IPv6.  Note that this will
          mean that IPv4 addresses are returned by MHD in the
          IPv6-mapped format (the ’struct sockaddr_in6’ format will be
          used for IPv4 and IPv6).

     ‘MHD_USE_PEDANTIC_CHECKS’
          Deprecated (use ‘MHD_OPTION_STRICT_FOR_CLIENT’).  Be pedantic
          about the protocol.  Specifically, at the moment, this flag
          causes MHD to reject HTTP 1.1 connections without a ‘Host’
          header.  This is required by the standard, but of course in
          violation of the “be as liberal as possible in what you
          accept” norm.  It is recommended to turn this *ON* if you are
          testing clients against MHD, and *OFF* in production.

     ‘MHD_USE_POLL’
          Use ‘poll()’ instead of ‘select()’.  This allows sockets with
          descriptors ‘>= FD_SETSIZE’.  This option currently only works
          in conjunction with ‘MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD’ (at this
          point).  If you specify ‘MHD_USE_POLL’ and the local platform
          does not support it, ‘MHD_start_daemon’ will return NULL.

     ‘MHD_USE_EPOLL’
          Use ‘epoll()’ instead of ‘poll()’ or ‘select()’.  This allows
          sockets with descriptors ‘>= FD_SETSIZE’.  This option is only
          available on some systems and does not work in conjunction
          with ‘MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION’ (at this point).  If you
          specify ‘MHD_USE_EPOLL’ and the local platform does not
          support it, ‘MHD_start_daemon’ will return NULL. Using
          ‘epoll()’ instead of ‘select()’ or ‘poll()’ can in some
          situations result in significantly higher performance as the
          system call has fundamentally lower complexity (O(1) for
          ‘epoll()’ vs.  O(n) for ‘select()’/‘poll()’ where n is the
          number of open connections).

     ‘MHD_USE_TURBO’
          Enable optimizations to aggressively improve performance.

          Currently, the optimizations this option enables are based on
          opportunistic reads and writes.  Basically, MHD will simply
          try to read or write or accept on a socket before checking
          that the socket is ready for IO using the event loop
          mechanism.  As the sockets are non-blocking, this may fail (at
          a loss of performance), but generally MHD does this in
          situations where the operation is likely to succeed, in which
          case performance is improved.  Setting the flag should
          generally be safe (even though the code is slightly more
          experimental).  You may want to benchmark your application to
          see if this makes any difference for you.

     ‘MHD_USE_SUPPRESS_DATE_NO_CLOCK’
          Suppress (automatically) adding the ’Date:’ header to HTTP
          responses.  This option should ONLY be used on systems that do
          not have a clock and that DO provide other mechanisms for
          cache control.  See also RFC 2616, section 14.18 (exception
          3).

     ‘MHD_USE_NO_LISTEN_SOCKET’
          Run the HTTP server without any listen socket.  This option
          only makes sense if ‘MHD_add_connection’ is going to be used
          exclusively to connect HTTP clients to the HTTP server.  This
          option is incompatible with using a thread pool; if it is
          used, ‘MHD_OPTION_THREAD_POOL_SIZE’ is ignored.

     ‘MHD_USE_ITC’
          Force MHD to use a signal inter-thread communication channel
          to notify the event loop (of threads) of our shutdown and
          other events.  This is required if an application uses
          ‘MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD’ and then performs
          ‘MHD_quiesce_daemon’ (which eliminates our ability to signal
          termination via the listen socket).  In these modes,
          ‘MHD_quiesce_daemon’ will fail if this option was not set.
          Also, use of this option is automatic (as in, you do not even
          have to specify it), if ‘MHD_USE_NO_LISTEN_SOCKET’ is
          specified.  In "external" select mode, this option is always
          simply ignored.

          Using this option also guarantees that MHD will not call
          ‘shutdown()’ on the listen socket, which means a parent
          process can continue to use the socket.

     ‘MHD_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME’
          Enables using ‘MHD_suspend_connection’ and
          ‘MHD_resume_connection’, as performing these calls requires
          some additional inter-thred communication channels to be
          created, and code not using these calls should not pay the
          cost.

     ‘MHD_USE_TCP_FASTOPEN’
          Enable TCP_FASTOPEN on the listen socket.  TCP_FASTOPEN is
          currently supported on Linux >= 3.6.  On other systems using
          this option with cause ‘MHD_start_daemon’ to fail.

     ‘MHD_ALLOW_UPGRADE’
          This option must be set if you want to upgrade connections
          (via “101 Switching Protocols” responses).  This requires MHD
          to allocate additional resources, and hence we require this
          special flag so we only use the resources that are really
          needed.

     ‘MHD_USE_AUTO’
          Automatically select best event loop style (polling function)
          depending on requested mode by other MHD flags and functions
          available on platform.  If application doesn’t have
          requirements for any specific polling function, it’s
          recommended to use this flag.  This flag is very convenient
          for multiplatform applications.

     ‘MHD_USE_POST_HANDSHAKE_AUTH_SUPPORT’
          Tell the TLS library to support post handshake client
          authentication.  Only useful in combination with
          ‘MHD_USE_TLS’.

          This option will only work if the underlying TLS library
          supports it (i.e.  GnuTLS after 3.6.3).  If the TLS library
          does not support it, MHD may ignore the option and proceed
          without supporting this features.

     ‘MHD_USE_INSECURE_TLS_EARLY_DATA’
          Tell the TLS library to support TLS v1.3 early data (0-RTT)
          with the resulting security drawbacks.  Only enable this if
          you really know what you are doing.  MHD currently does NOT
          enforce that this only affects GET requests!  You have been
          warned.

          This option will only work if the underlying TLS library
          supports it (i.e.  GnuTLS after 3.6.3).  If the TLS library
          does not support it, MHD may ignore the option and proceed
          without supporting this features.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_OPTION
     MHD options.  Passed in the varargs portion of
     ‘MHD_start_daemon()’.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_END’
          No more options / last option.  This is used to terminate the
          VARARGs list.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_MEMORY_LIMIT’
          Maximum memory size per connection (followed by a ‘size_t’).
          The default is 32 kB (32*1024 bytes) as defined by the
          internal constant ‘MHD_POOL_SIZE_DEFAULT’.  Values above 128k
          are unlikely to result in much benefit, as half of the memory
          will be typically used for IO, and TCP buffers are unlikely to
          support window sizes above 64k on most systems.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_MEMORY_INCREMENT’
          Increment to use for growing the read buffer (followed by a
          ‘size_t’).  The default is 1024 (bytes).  Increasing this
          value will make MHD use memory for reading more aggressively,
          which can reduce the number of ‘recvfrom’ calls but may
          increase the number of ‘sendto’ calls.  The given value must
          fit within MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_MEMORY_LIMIT.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_LIMIT’
          Maximum number of concurrent connections to accept (followed
          by an ‘unsigned int’).  The default is ‘FD_SETSIZE - 4’ (the
          maximum number of file descriptors supported by ‘select’ minus
          four for ‘stdin’, ‘stdout’, ‘stderr’ and the server socket).
          In other words, the default is as large as possible.

          If the connection limit is reached, MHD’s behavior depends a
          bit on other options.  If ‘MHD_USE_ITC’ was given, MHD will
          stop accepting connections on the listen socket.  This will
          cause the operating system to queue connections (up to the
          ‘listen()’ limit) above the connection limit.  Those
          connections will be held until MHD is done processing at least
          one of the active connections.  If ‘MHD_USE_ITC’ is not set,
          then MHD will continue to ‘accept()’ and immediately ‘close()’
          these connections.

          Note that if you set a low connection limit, you can easily
          get into trouble with browsers doing request pipelining.  For
          example, if your connection limit is “1”, a browser may open a
          first connection to access your “index.html” file, keep it
          open but use a second connection to retrieve CSS files, images
          and the like.  In fact, modern browsers are typically by
          default configured for up to 15 parallel connections to a
          single server.  If this happens, MHD will refuse to even
          accept the second connection until the first connection is
          closed — which does not happen until timeout.  As a result,
          the browser will fail to render the page and seem to hang.  If
          you expect your server to operate close to the connection
          limit, you should first consider using a lower timeout value
          and also possibly add a “Connection: close” header to your
          response to ensure that request pipelining is not used and
          connections are closed immediately after the request has
          completed:
               MHD_add_response_header (response,
                                        MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION,
                                        "close");

     ‘MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT’
          After how many seconds of inactivity should a connection
          automatically be timed out?  (followed by an ‘unsigned int’;
          use zero for no timeout).  The default is zero (no timeout).

     ‘MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED’
          Register a function that should be called whenever a request
          has been completed (this can be used for application-specific
          clean up).  Requests that have never been presented to the
          application (via ‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback()’) will not
          result in notifications.

          This option should be followed by *TWO* pointers.  First a
          pointer to a function of type ‘MHD_RequestCompletedCallback()’
          and second a pointer to a closure to pass to the request
          completed callback.  The second pointer maybe ‘NULL’.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_CONNECTION’
          Register a function that should be called when the TCP
          connection to a client is opened or closed.  Note that
          ‘MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED’ and the ‘con_cls’ argument to
          the ‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback’ are per HTTP request (and
          there can be multiple HTTP requests per TCP connection).  The
          registered callback is called twice per TCP connection, with
          ‘MHD_CONNECTION_NOTIFY_STARTED’ and
          ‘MHD_CONNECTION_NOTIFY_CLOSED’ respectively.  An additional
          argument can be used to store TCP connection specific
          information, which can be retrieved using
          ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_SOCKET_CONTEXT’ during the lifetime of
          the TCP connection.  The respective location is not the same
          as the HTTP-request-specific ‘con_cls’ from the
          ‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback’.

          This option should be followed by *TWO* pointers.  First a
          pointer to a function of type ‘MHD_NotifyConnectionCallback()’
          and second a pointer to a closure to pass to the request
          completed callback.  The second pointer maybe ‘NULL’.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_PER_IP_CONNECTION_LIMIT’
          Limit on the number of (concurrent) connections made to the
          server from the same IP address.  Can be used to prevent one
          IP from taking over all of the allowed connections.  If the
          same IP tries to establish more than the specified number of
          connections, they will be immediately rejected.  The option
          should be followed by an ‘unsigned int’.  The default is zero,
          which means no limit on the number of connections from the
          same IP address.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_LISTEN_BACKLOG_SIZE’
          Set the size of the ‘listen()’ back log queue of the TCP
          socket.  Takes an ‘unsigned int’ as the argument.  Default is
          the platform-specific value of ‘SOMAXCONN’.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_STRICT_FOR_CLIENT’
          Specify how strict we should enforce the HTTP protocol.  Takes
          an ‘int’ as the argument.  Default is zero.

          If set to 1, MHD will be strict about the protocol.
          Specifically, at the moment, this flag uses MHD to reject HTTP
          1.1 connections without a "Host" header.  This is required by
          the standard, but of course in violation of the "be as liberal
          as possible in what you accept" norm.  It is recommended to
          set this to 1 if you are testing clients against MHD, and 0 in
          production.

          If set to -1 MHD will be permissive about the protocol,
          allowing slight deviations that are technically not allowed by
          the RFC. Specifically, at the moment, this flag causes MHD to
          allow spaces in header field names.  This is disallowed by the
          standard.

          It is not recommended to set it to -1 on publicly available
          servers as it may potentially lower level of protection.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_SERVER_INSANITY’
          Allows the application to disable certain sanity precautions
          in MHD. With these, the client can break the HTTP protocol, so
          this should never be used in production.  The options are,
          however, useful for testing HTTP clients against "broken"
          server implementations.  This argument must be followed by an
          ‘unsigned int’, corresponding to an ‘enum
          MHD_DisableSanityCheck’.

          Right now, no sanity checks can be disabled.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_SOCK_ADDR’
          Bind daemon to the supplied socket address.  This option
          should be followed by a ‘struct sockaddr *’.  If
          ‘MHD_USE_IPv6’ is specified, the ‘struct sockaddr*’ should
          point to a ‘struct sockaddr_in6’, otherwise to a ‘struct
          sockaddr_in’.  If this option is not specified, the daemon
          will listen to incoming connections from anywhere.  If you use
          this option, the ’port’ argument from ‘MHD_start_daemon’ is
          ignored and the port from the given ‘struct sockaddr *’ will
          be used instead.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_URI_LOG_CALLBACK’
          Specify a function that should be called before parsing the
          URI from the client.  The specified callback function can be
          used for processing the URI (including the options) before it
          is parsed.  The URI after parsing will no longer contain the
          options, which maybe inconvenient for logging.  This option
          should be followed by two arguments, the first one must be of
          the form
                void * my_logger(void * cls, const char * uri, struct MHD_Connection *con)
          where the return value will be passed as ‘*con_cls’ in calls
          to the ‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback’ when this request is
          processed later; returning a value of ‘NULL’ has no special
          significance; (however, note that if you return non-‘NULL’,
          you can no longer rely on the first call to the access handler
          having ‘NULL == *con_cls’ on entry) ‘cls’ will be set to the
          second argument following MHD_OPTION_URI_LOG_CALLBACK.
          Finally, ‘uri’ will be the 0-terminated URI of the request.

          Note that during the time of this call, most of the
          connection’s state is not initialized (as we have not yet
          parsed he headers).  However, information about the connecting
          client (IP, socket) is available.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_KEY’
          Memory pointer to the private key to be used by the HTTPS
          daemon.  This option should be followed by an "const char*"
          argument.  This should be used in conjunction with
          ’MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_CERT’.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_KEY_PASSWORD’
          Memory pointer to the password that decrypts the private key
          to be used by the HTTPS daemon.  This option should be
          followed by an "const char*" argument.  This should be used in
          conjunction with ’MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_KEY’.

          The password (or passphrase) is only used immediately during
          ‘MHD_start_daemon()’.  Thus, the application may want to erase
          it from memory afterwards for additional security.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_CERT’
          Memory pointer to the certificate to be used by the HTTPS
          daemon.  This option should be followed by an "const char*"
          argument.  This should be used in conjunction with
          ’MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_KEY’.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_TRUST’
          Memory pointer to the CA certificate to be used by the HTTPS
          daemon to authenticate and trust clients certificates.  This
          option should be followed by an "const char*" argument.  The
          presence of this option activates the request of certificate
          to the client.  The request to the client is marked optional,
          and it is the responsibility of the server to check the
          presence of the certificate if needed.  Note that most
          browsers will only present a client certificate only if they
          have one matching the specified CA, not sending any
          certificate otherwise.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_CRED_TYPE’
          Daemon credentials type.  Either certificate or anonymous,
          this option should be followed by one of the values listed in
          "enum gnutls_credentials_type_t".

     ‘MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_PRIORITIES’
          SSL/TLS protocol version and ciphers.  This option must be
          followed by an "const char *" argument specifying the SSL/TLS
          protocol versions and ciphers that are acceptable for the
          application.  The string is passed unchanged to
          gnutls_priority_init.  If this option is not specified,
          “NORMAL” is used.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_CERT_CALLBACK’
          Use a callback to determine which X.509 certificate should be
          used for a given HTTPS connection.  This option should be
          followed by a argument of type
          "gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function2 *".  This option
          provides an alternative to MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_KEY and
          MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_CERT. You must use this version if
          multiple domains are to be hosted at the same IP address using
          TLS’s Server Name Indication (SNI) extension.  In this case,
          the callback is expected to select the correct certificate
          based on the SNI information provided.  The callback is
          expected to access the SNI data using
          gnutls_server_name_get().  Using this option requires GnuTLS
          3.0 or higher.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_CERT_CALLBACK2’
          Use a callback to determine which X.509 certificate should be
          used for a given HTTPS connection.  This option should be
          followed by a argument of type
          ‘gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function3 *‘.  This option
          provides an alternative/extension to
          #MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_CERT_CALLBACK. You must use this version if
          you want to use OCSP stapling.  Using this option requires
          GnuTLS 3.6.3 or higher.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_GNUTLS_PSK_CRED_HANDLER’
          Use pre-shared key for TLS credentials.  Pass a pointer to
          callback of type ‘MHD_PskServerCredentialsCallback’ and a
          closure.  The function will be called to retrieve the shared
          key for a given username.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_DIGEST_AUTH_RANDOM’
          Digest Authentication nonce’s seed.

          This option should be followed by two arguments.  First an
          integer of type "size_t" which specifies the size of the
          buffer pointed to by the second argument in bytes.  Note that
          the application must ensure that the buffer of the second
          argument remains allocated and unmodified while the daemon is
          running.  For security, you SHOULD provide a fresh random
          nonce when using MHD with Digest Authentication.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_NONCE_NC_SIZE’

          Size of an array of nonce and nonce counter map.  This option
          must be followed by an "unsigned int" argument that have the
          size (number of elements) of a map of a nonce and a
          nonce-counter.  If this option is not specified, a default
          value of 4 will be used (which might be too small for servers
          handling many requests).  If you do not use digest
          authentication at all, you can specify a value of zero to save
          some memory.

          You should calculate the value of NC_SIZE based on the number
          of connections per second multiplied by your expected session
          duration plus a factor of about two for hash table collisions.
          For example, if you expect 100 digest-authenticated
          connections per second and the average user to stay on your
          site for 5 minutes, then you likely need a value of about
          60000.  On the other hand, if you can only expect only 10
          digest-authenticated connections per second, tolerate browsers
          getting a fresh nonce for each request and expect a HTTP
          request latency of 250 ms, then a value of about 5 should be
          fine.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_LISTEN_SOCKET’
          Listen socket to use.  Pass a listen socket for MHD to use
          (systemd-style).  If this option is used, MHD will not open
          its own listen socket(s).  The argument passed must be of type
          "int" and refer to an existing socket that has been bound to a
          port and is listening.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_EXTERNAL_LOGGER’
          Use the given function for logging error messages.  This
          option must be followed by two arguments; the first must be a
          pointer to a function of type ’void fun(void * arg, const char
          * fmt, va_list ap)’ and the second a pointer of type ’void*’
          which will be passed as the "arg" argument to "fun".

          Note that MHD will not generate any log messages without the
          MHD_USE_ERROR_LOG flag set and if MHD was compiled with the
          "–disable-messages" flag.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_THREAD_POOL_SIZE’
          Number (unsigned int) of threads in thread pool.  Enable
          thread pooling by setting this value to to something greater
          than 1.  Currently, thread mode must be
          MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD if thread pooling is enabled
          (‘MHD_start_daemon’ returns ‘NULL’ for an unsupported thread
          mode).

     ‘MHD_OPTION_ARRAY’
          This option can be used for initializing MHD using options
          from an array.  A common use for this is writing an FFI for
          MHD. The actual options given are in an array of ’struct
          MHD_OptionItem’, so this option requires a single argument of
          type ’struct MHD_OptionItem’.  The array must be terminated
          with an entry ‘MHD_OPTION_END’.

          An example for code using MHD_OPTION_ARRAY is:
               struct MHD_OptionItem ops[] = {
                { MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_LIMIT, 100, NULL },
                { MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT, 10, NULL },
                { MHD_OPTION_END, 0, NULL }
               };
               d = MHD_start_daemon(0, 8080, NULL, NULL, dh, NULL,
                                    MHD_OPTION_ARRAY, ops,
                                    MHD_OPTION_END);
          For options that expect a single pointer argument, the second
          member of the ‘struct MHD_OptionItem’ is ignored.  For options
          that expect two pointer arguments, the first argument must be
          cast to ‘intptr_t’.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_UNESCAPE_CALLBACK’

          Specify a function that should be called for unescaping escape
          sequences in URIs and URI arguments.  Note that this function
          will NOT be used by the MHD_PostProcessor.  If this option is
          not specified, the default method will be used which decodes
          escape sequences of the form "%HH". This option should be
          followed by two arguments, the first one must be of the form

                 size_t my_unescaper(void * cls, struct MHD_Connection *c, char *s)

          where the return value must be ‘strlen(s)’ and ‘s’ should be
          updated.  Note that the unescape function must not lengthen
          ‘s’ (the result must be shorter than the input and still be
          0-terminated).  ‘cls’ will be set to the second argument
          following MHD_OPTION_UNESCAPE_CALLBACK.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_THREAD_STACK_SIZE’
          Maximum stack size for threads created by MHD. This option
          must be followed by a ‘size_t’).  Not specifying this option
          or using a value of zero means using the system default (which
          is likely to differ based on your platform).

     ‘MHD_OPTION_TCP_FASTQUEUE_QUEUE_SIZE’
          When the flag ‘MHD_USE_TCP_FASTOPEN’ is used, this option sets
          the connection handshake queue size for the TCP FASTOPEN
          connections.  Note that a TCP FASTOPEN connection handshake
          occupies more resources than a TCP handshake as the SYN
          packets also contain DATA which is kept in the associate state
          until handshake is completed.  If this option is not given the
          queue size is set to a default value of 10.  This option must
          be followed by a ‘unsigned int’.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_DHPARAMS’
          Memory pointer for the Diffie-Hellman parameters (dh.pem) to
          be used by the HTTPS daemon for key exchange.  This option
          must be followed by a ‘const char *’ argument.  The argument
          would be a zero-terminated string with a PEM encoded PKCS3 DH
          parameters structure suitable for passing to
          ‘gnutls_dh_parms_import_pkcs3’.

     ‘MHD_OPTION_LISTENING_ADDRESS_REUSE’
          This option must be followed by a ‘unsigned int’ argument.  If
          this option is present and true (nonzero) parameter is given,
          allow reusing the address:port of the listening socket (using
          ‘SO_REUSEPORT’ on most platforms, and ‘SO_REUSEADDR’ on
          Windows).  If a false (zero) parameter is given, disallow
          reusing the the address:port of the listening socket (this
          usually requires no special action, but ‘SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE’
          is needed on Windows).  If this option is not present
          ‘SO_REUSEADDR’ is used on all platforms except Windows so
          reusing of address:port is disallowed.

 -- C Struct: MHD_OptionItem
     Entry in an MHD_OPTION_ARRAY. See the ‘MHD_OPTION_ARRAY’ option
     argument for its use.

     The ‘option’ member is used to specify which option is specified in
     the array.  The other members specify the respective argument.

     Note that for options taking only a single pointer, the ‘ptr_value’
     member should be set.  For options taking two pointer arguments,
     the first pointer must be cast to ‘intptr_t’ and both the ‘value’
     and the ‘ptr_value’ members should be used to pass the two
     pointers.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_ValueKind
     The ‘MHD_ValueKind’ specifies the source of the key-value pairs in
     the HTTP protocol.

     ‘MHD_HEADER_KIND’
          HTTP header.

     ‘MHD_COOKIE_KIND’
          Cookies.  Note that the original HTTP header containing the
          cookie(s) will still be available and intact.

     ‘MHD_POSTDATA_KIND’
          ‘POST’ data.  This is available only if a content encoding
          supported by MHD is used (currently only URL encoding), and
          only if the posted content fits within the available memory
          pool.  Note that in that case, the upload data given to the
          ‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback()’ will be empty (since it has
          already been processed).

     ‘MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND’
          ‘GET’ (URI) arguments.

     ‘MHD_FOOTER_KIND’
          HTTP footer (only for http 1.1 chunked encodings).

 -- Enumeration: MHD_RequestTerminationCode
     The ‘MHD_RequestTerminationCode’ specifies reasons why a request
     has been terminated (or completed).

     ‘MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_COMPLETED_OK’
          We finished sending the response.

     ‘MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_WITH_ERROR’
          Error handling the connection (resources exhausted, other side
          closed connection, application error accepting request, etc.)

     ‘MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_TIMEOUT_REACHED’
          No activity on the connection for the number of seconds
          specified using ‘MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT’.

     ‘MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_DAEMON_SHUTDOWN’
          We had to close the session since MHD was being shut down.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_ResponseMemoryMode
     The ‘MHD_ResponeMemoryMode’ specifies how MHD should treat the
     memory buffer given for the response in
     ‘MHD_create_response_from_buffer’.

     ‘MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT’
          Buffer is a persistent (static/global) buffer that won’t
          change for at least the lifetime of the response, MHD should
          just use it, not free it, not copy it, just keep an alias to
          it.

     ‘MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_FREE’
          Buffer is heap-allocated with ‘malloc’ (or equivalent) and
          should be freed by MHD after processing the response has
          concluded (response reference counter reaches zero).

     ‘MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_COPY’
          Buffer is in transient memory, but not on the heap (for
          example, on the stack or non-malloc allocated) and only valid
          during the call to ‘MHD_create_response_from_buffer’.  MHD
          must make its own private copy of the data for processing.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_ResponseFlags
     Response-specific flags.  Passed as an argument to
     ‘MHD_set_response_options()’.

     ‘MHD_RF_NONE’
          No special handling.

     ‘MHD_RF_HTTP_VERSION_1_0_ONLY’
          Only respond in conservative HTTP 1.0-mode.  In particular, do
          not (automatically) sent "Connection" headers and always close
          the connection after generating the response.

          By default, MHD will respond using the same HTTP version which
          was set in the request.  You can also set the
          ‘MHD_RF_HTTP_VERSION_1_0_RESPONSE’ flag to force version 1.0
          in the response.

     ‘MHD_RF_HTTP_VERSION_1_0_RESPONSE’
          Only respond in HTTP 1.0-mode.  Contrary to the
          ‘MHD_RF_HTTP_VERSION_1_0_ONLY’ flag, the response’s HTTP
          version will always be set to 1.0 and “Connection” headers are
          still supported.

          You can even combine this option with
          MHD_RF_HTTP_VERSION_1_0_ONLY to change the response’s HTTP
          version while maintaining strict compliance with HTTP 1.0
          regarding connection management.

          This solution is not perfect as this flag is set on the
          response which is created after header processing.  So MHD
          will behave as a HTTP 1.1 server until the response is queued.
          It means that an invalid HTTP 1.1 request will fail even if
          the response is sent with HTTP 1.0 and the request would be
          valid if interpreted with this version.  For example, this
          request will fail in strict mode:

          GET / HTTP/1.1

          as the “Host” header is missing and is mandatory in HTTP 1.1,
          but it should succeed when interpreted with HTTP 1.0.

     ‘MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH’
          Disable sanity check preventing clients from manually setting
          the HTTP content length option.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_ResponseOptions
     Response-specific options.  Passed in the varargs portion of
     ‘MHD_set_response_options()’.

     ‘MHD_RO_END’
          No more options / last option.  This is used to terminate the
          VARARGs list.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG
     Options for the MHD websocket stream.

     This is used for initialization of a websocket stream when calling
     ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init’ or ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’ and
     alters the behavior of the websocket stream.

     Note that websocket streams are only available if you include the
     header file ‘microhttpd_ws.h’ and compiled _libmicrohttpd_ with
     websockets.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_SERVER’
          The websocket stream is initialized in server mode (default).
          Thus all outgoing payload will not be masked.  All incoming
          payload must be masked.

          This flag cannot be used together with
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_CLIENT’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_CLIENT’
          The websocket stream is initialized in client mode.  You will
          usually never use that mode in combination with
          _libmicrohttpd_, because _libmicrohttpd_ provides a server and
          not a client.  In client mode all outgoing payload will be
          masked (XOR-ed with random values).  All incoming payload must
          be unmasked.  If you use this mode, you must always call
          ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’ instead of
          ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init’, because you need to pass a random
          number generator callback function for masking.

          This flag cannot be used together with
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_SERVER’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_NO_FRAGMENTS’
          You don’t want to get fragmented data while decoding
          (default).  Fragmented frames will be internally put together
          until they are complete.  Whether or not data is fragmented is
          decided by the sender of the data during encoding.

          This cannot be used together with
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_WANT_FRAGMENTS’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_WANT_FRAGMENTS’
          You want fragmented data, if it appears while decoding.  You
          will receive the content of the fragmented frame, but if you
          are decoding text, you will never get an unfinished UTF-8
          sequence (if the sequence appears between two fragments).
          Instead the text will end before the unfinished UTF-8
          sequence.  With the next fragment, which finishes the UTF-8
          sequence, you will get the complete UTF-8 sequence.

          This cannot be used together with
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_NO_FRAGMENTS’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_GENERATE_CLOSE_FRAMES_ON_ERROR’
          If the websocket stream becomes invalid during decoding due to
          protocol errors, a matching close frame will automatically be
          generated.  The close frame will be returned via the
          parameters ‘payload’ and ‘payload_len’ of
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ and the return value is negative (a
          value of ‘enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS’).

          The generated close frame must be freed by the caller with
          ‘MHD_websocket_free’.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_WEBSOCKET_FRAGMENTATION
     This enumeration is used to specify the fragmentation behavior when
     encoding of data (text/binary) for a websocket stream.  This is
     used with ‘MHD_websocket_encode_text’ or
     ‘MHD_websocket_encode_binary’.

     Note that websocket streams are only available if you include the
     header file ‘microhttpd_ws.h’ and compiled _libmicrohttpd_ with
     websockets.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FRAGMENTATION_NONE’
          You don’t want to use fragmentation.  The encoded frame
          consists of only one frame.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FRAGMENTATION_FIRST’
          You want to use fragmentation.  The encoded frame is the first
          frame of a series of data frames of the same type (text or
          binary).  You may send control frames (ping, pong or close)
          between these data frames.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FRAGMENTATION_FOLLOWING’
          You want to use fragmentation.  The encoded frame is not the
          first frame of the series of data frames, but also not the
          last one.  You may send control frames (ping, pong or close)
          between these data frames.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FRAGMENTATION_LAST’
          You want to use fragmentation.  The encoded frame is the last
          frame of the series of data frames, but also not the first
          one.  After this frame, you may send all types of frames
          again.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS
     This enumeration is used for the return value of almost every
     websocket stream function.  Errors are negative and values equal to
     or above zero mean a success.  Positive values are only used by
     ‘MHD_websocket_decode’.

     Note that websocket streams are only available if you include the
     header file ‘microhttpd_ws.h’ and compiled _libmicrohttpd_ with
     websockets.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_OK’
          The call succeeded.  Especially for ‘MHD_websocket_decode’
          this means that no error occurred, but also no frame has been
          completed yet.  For other functions this means simply a
          success.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_TEXT_FRAME’
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ has decoded a text frame.  The
          parameters ‘payload’ and ‘payload_len’ are filled with the
          decoded text (if any).  You must free the returned ‘payload’
          after use with ‘MHD_websocket_free’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_BINARY_FRAME’
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ has decoded a binary frame.  The
          parameters ‘payload’ and ‘payload_len’ are filled with the
          decoded binary data (if any).  You must free the returned
          ‘payload’ after use with ‘MHD_websocket_free’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_CLOSE_FRAME’
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ has decoded a close frame.  This means
          you must close the socket using ‘MHD_upgrade_action’ with
          ‘MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE’.  You may respond with a close
          frame before closing.  The parameters ‘payload’ and
          ‘payload_len’ are filled with the close reason (if any).  The
          close reason starts with a two byte sequence of close code in
          network byte order (see ‘enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON’).
          After these two bytes a UTF-8 encoded close reason may follow.
          You can call ‘MHD_websocket_split_close_reason’ to split that
          close reason.  You must free the returned ‘payload’ after use
          with ‘MHD_websocket_free’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_PING_FRAME’
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ has decoded a ping frame.  You should
          respond to this with a pong frame.  The pong frame must
          contain the same binary data as the corresponding ping frame
          (if it had any).  The parameters ‘payload’ and ‘payload_len’
          are filled with the binary ping data (if any).  You must free
          the returned ‘payload’ after use with ‘MHD_websocket_free’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_PONG_FRAME’
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ has decoded a pong frame.  You should
          usually only receive pong frames if you sent a ping frame
          before.  The binary data should be equal to your ping frame
          and can be used to distinguish the response if you sent
          multiple ping frames.  The parameters ‘payload’ and
          ‘payload_len’ are filled with the binary pong data (if any).
          You must free the returned ‘payload’ after use with
          ‘MHD_websocket_free’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_TEXT_FIRST_FRAGMENT’
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ has decoded a text frame fragment.  The
          parameters ‘payload’ and ‘payload_len’ are filled with the
          decoded text (if any).  This is like
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_TEXT_FRAME’, but it can only appear if
          you specified ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_WANT_FRAGMENTS’ during the
          call of ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init’ or
          ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’.  You must free the returned
          ‘payload’ after use with ‘MHD_websocket_free’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_TEXT_FIRST_FRAGMENT’
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ has decoded a binary frame fragment.
          The parameters ‘payload’ and ‘payload_len’ are filled with the
          decoded binary data (if any).  This is like
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_BINARY_FRAME’, but it can only appear if
          you specified ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_WANT_FRAGMENTS’ during the
          call of ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init’ or
          ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’.  You must free the returned
          ‘payload’ after use with ‘MHD_websocket_free’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_TEXT_NEXT_FRAGMENT’
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ has decoded the next text frame
          fragment.  The parameters ‘payload’ and ‘payload_len’ are
          filled with the decoded text (if any).  This is like
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_TEXT_FIRST_FRAGMENT’, but it appears
          only after the first and before the last fragment of a series
          of fragments.  It can only appear if you specified
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_WANT_FRAGMENTS’ during the call of
          ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init’ or ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’.
          You must free the returned ‘payload’ after use with
          ‘MHD_websocket_free’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_BINARY_NEXT_FRAGMENT’
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ has decoded the next binary frame
          fragment.  The parameters ‘payload’ and ‘payload_len’ are
          filled with the decoded binary data (if any).  This is like
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_BINARY_FIRST_FRAGMENT’, but it appears
          only after the first and before the last fragment of a series
          of fragments.  It can only appear if you specified
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_WANT_FRAGMENTS’ during the call of
          ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init’ or ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’.
          You must free the returned ‘payload’ after use with
          ‘MHD_websocket_free’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_TEXT_LAST_FRAGMENT’
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ has decoded the last text frame
          fragment.  The parameters ‘payload’ and ‘payload_len’ are
          filled with the decoded text (if any).  This is like
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_TEXT_FIRST_FRAGMENT’, but it appears
          only for the last fragment of a series of fragments.  It can
          only appear if you specified
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_WANT_FRAGMENTS’ during the call of
          ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init’ or ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’.
          You must free the returned ‘payload’ after use with
          ‘MHD_websocket_free’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_BINARY_LAST_FRAGMENT’
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ has decoded the last binary frame
          fragment.  The parameters ‘payload’ and ‘payload_len’ are
          filled with the decoded binary data (if any).  This is like
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_BINARY_FIRST_FRAGMENT’, but it appears
          only for the last fragment of a series of fragments.  It can
          only appear if you specified
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_WANT_FRAGMENTS’ during the call of
          ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init’ or ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’.
          You must free the returned ‘payload’ after use with
          ‘MHD_websocket_free’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_PROTOCOL_ERROR’
          The call failed and the stream is invalid now for decoding.
          You must close the websocket now using ‘MHD_upgrade_action’
          with ‘MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE’.  You may send a close frame
          before closing.  This is only used by ‘MHD_websocket_decode’
          and happens if the stream contains errors (i.  e.  invalid
          byte data).

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_STREAM_BROKEN’
          You tried to decode something, but the stream has already been
          marked invalid.  You must close the websocket now using
          ‘MHD_upgrade_action’ with ‘MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE’.  You may
          send a close frame before closing.  This is only used by
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ and happens if you call
          ‘MDM_websocket_decode’ again after has been invalidated.  You
          can call ‘MHD_websocket_stream_is_valid’ at any time to check
          whether a stream is invalid or not.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_MEMORY_ERROR’
          A memory allocation failed.  The stream remains valid.  If
          this occurred while decoding, the decoding could be possible
          later if enough memory is available.  This could happen while
          decoding if you received a too big data frame.  You could try
          to specify max_payload_size during the call of
          ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init’ or ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’ to
          avoid this and close the websocket instead.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_PARAMETER_ERROR’
          You passed invalid parameters during the function call (i.  e.
          a NULL pointer for a required parameter).  The stream remains
          valid.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED’
          The maximum payload size has been exceeded.  If you got this
          return code from ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ then the stream
          becomes invalid and the websocket must be closed using
          ‘MHD_upgrade_action’ with ‘MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE’.  You may
          send a close frame before closing.  The maximum payload size
          is specified during the call of ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init’ or
          ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’.  This can also appear if you
          specified 0 as maximum payload size when the message is
          greater than the maximum allocatable memory size (i.  e.  more
          than 4 GiB on 32 bit systems).  If you got this return code
          from ‘MHD_websocket_encode_close’, ‘MHD_websocket_encode_ping’
          or ‘MHD_websocket_encode_pong’ then you passed to much payload
          data.  The stream remains valid then.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_UTF8_ENCODING_ERROR’
          An UTF-8 sequence is invalid.  If you got this return code
          from ‘MHD_websocket_decode’ then the stream becomes invalid
          and you must close the websocket using ‘MHD_upgrade_action’
          with ‘MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE’.  You may send a close frame
          before closing.  If you got this from
          ‘MHD_websocket_encode_text’ or ‘MHD_websocket_encode_close’
          then you passed invalid UTF-8 text.  The stream remains valid
          then.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS_NO_WEBSOCKET_HANDSHAKE_HEADER’
          A check routine for the HTTP headers came to the conclusion
          that the header value isn’t valid for a websocket handshake
          request.  This value can only be returned from the following
          functions: ‘MHD_websocket_check_http_version’,
          ‘MHD_websocket_check_connection_header’,
          ‘MHD_websocket_check_upgrade_header’,
          ‘MHD_websocket_check_version_header’,
          ‘MHD_websocket_create_accept_header’

 -- Enumeration: MHD_WEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON
     Enumeration of possible close reasons for websocket close frames.

     The possible values are specified in RFC 6455 7.4.1 These close
     reasons here are the default set specified by RFC 6455, but also
     other close reasons could be used.

     The definition is for short:
        • 0-999 are never used (if you pass 0 in
          ‘MHD_websocket_encode_close’ then no close reason is used).
        • 1000-2999 are specified by RFC 6455.
        • 3000-3999 are specified by libraries, etc.  but must be
          registered by IANA.
        • 4000-4999 are reserved for private use.

     Note that websocket streams are only available if you include the
     header file ‘microhttpd_ws.h’ and compiled _libmicrohttpd_ with
     websockets.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON_NO_REASON’
          This value is used as placeholder for
          ‘MHD_websocket_encode_close’ to tell that you don’t want to
          specify any reason.  If you use this value then no reason text
          may be used.  This value cannot be a result of decoding,
          because this value is not a valid close reason for the
          websocket protocol.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON_REGULAR’
          You close the websocket because it fulfilled its purpose and
          shall now be closed in a normal, planned way.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON_GOING_AWAY’
          You close the websocket because you are shutting down the
          server or something similar.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON_PROTOCOL_ERROR’
          You close the websocket because a protocol error occurred
          during decoding (i.  e.  invalid byte data).

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON_UNSUPPORTED_DATATYPE’
          You close the websocket because you received data which you
          don’t accept.  For example if you received a binary frame, but
          your application only expects text frames.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON_MALFORMED_UTF8’
          You close the websocket because it contains malformed UTF-8.
          The UTF-8 validity is automatically checked by
          ‘MHD_websocket_decode’, so you don’t need to check it on your
          own.  UTF-8 is specified in RFC 3629.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON_POLICY_VIOLATED’
          You close the websocket because you received a frame which is
          too big to process.  You can specify the maximum allowed
          payload size during the call of ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init’ or
          ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON_MISSING_EXTENSION’
          This status code can be sent by the client if it expected a
          specific extension, but this extension hasn’t been negotiated.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON_UNEXPECTED_CONDITION’
          The server closes the websocket because it encountered an
          unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the
          request.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP
     Enumeration of possible UTF-8 check steps for websocket functions

     These values are used during the encoding of fragmented text frames
     or for error analysis while encoding text frames.  Its values
     specify the next step of the UTF-8 check.  UTF-8 sequences consist
     of one to four bytes.  This enumeration just says how long the
     current UTF-8 sequence is and what is the next expected byte.

     Note that websocket streams are only available if you include the
     header file ‘microhttpd_ws.h’ and compiled _libmicrohttpd_ with
     websockets.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP_NORMAL’
          There is no open UTF-8 sequence.  The next byte must be
          0x00-0x7F or 0xC2-0xF4.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP_UTF2TAIL_1OF1’
          The second byte of a two byte UTF-8 sequence.  The first byte
          was 0xC2-0xDF. The next byte must be 0x80-0xBF.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP_UTF3TAIL1_1OF2’
          The second byte of a three byte UTF-8 sequence.  The first
          byte was 0xE0.  The next byte must be 0xA0-0xBF.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP_UTF3TAIL2_1OF2’
          The second byte of a three byte UTF-8 sequence.  The first
          byte was 0xED. The next byte must by 0x80-0x9F.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP_UTF3TAIL_1OF2’
          The second byte of a three byte UTF-8 sequence.  The first
          byte was 0xE1-0xEC or 0xEE-0xEF. The next byte must be
          0x80-0xBF.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP_UTF3TAIL_2OF2’
          The third byte of a three byte UTF-8 sequence.  The next byte
          must be 0x80-0xBF.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP_UTF4TAIL1_1OF3’
          The second byte of a four byte UTF-8 sequence.  The first byte
          was 0xF0.  The next byte must be 0x90-0xBF.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP_UTF4TAIL2_1OF3’
          The second byte of a four byte UTF-8 sequence.  The first byte
          was 0xF4.  The next byte must be 0x80-0x8F.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP_UTF4TAIL_1OF3’
          The second byte of a four byte UTF-8 sequence.  The first byte
          was 0xF1-0xF3.  The next byte must be 0x80-0xBF.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP_UTF4TAIL_2OF3’
          The third byte of a four byte UTF-8 sequence.  The next byte
          must be 0x80-0xBF.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP_UTF4TAIL_3OF3’
          The fourth byte of a four byte UTF-8 sequence.  The next byte
          must be 0x80-0xBF.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_WEBSOCKET_VALIDITY
     Enumeration of validity values of a websocket stream

     These values are used for ‘MHD_websocket_stream_is_valid’ and
     specify the validity status.

     Note that websocket streams are only available if you include the
     header file ‘microhttpd_ws.h’ and compiled _libmicrohttpd_ with
     websockets.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_VALIDITY_INVALID’
          The stream is invalid.  It cannot be used for decoding
          anymore.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_VALIDITY_VALID’
          The stream is valid.  Decoding works as expected.

     ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_VALIDITY_ONLY_VALID_FOR_CONTROL_FRAMES’
          The stream has received a close frame and is partly invalid.
          You can still use the stream for decoding, but if a data frame
          is received an error will be reported.  After a close frame
          has been sent, no data frames may follow from the sender of
          the close frame.

4 Callback functions definition
*******************************

 -- Function Pointer: enum MHD_Result *MHD_AcceptPolicyCallback (void
          *cls, const struct sockaddr * addr, socklen_t addrlen)
     Invoked in the context of a connection to allow or deny a client to
     connect.  This callback return ‘MHD_YES’ if connection is allowed,
     ‘MHD_NO’ if not.

     CLS
          custom value selected at callback registration time;
     ADDR
          address information from the client;
     ADDRLEN
          length of the address information.

 -- Function Pointer: enum MHD_Result *MHD_AccessHandlerCallback (void
          *cls, struct MHD_Connection * connection, const char *url,
          const char *method, const char *version, const char
          *upload_data, size_t *upload_data_size, void **con_cls)
     Invoked in the context of a connection to answer a request from the
     client.  This callback must call MHD functions (example: the
     ‘MHD_Response’ ones) to provide content to give back to the client
     and return an HTTP status code (i.e.  ‘200’ for OK, ‘404’, etc.).

     *note microhttpd-post::, for details on how to code this callback.

     Must return ‘MHD_YES’ if the connection was handled successfully,
     ‘MHD_NO’ if the socket must be closed due to a serious error while
     handling the request

     CLS
          custom value selected at callback registration time;

     URL
          the URL requested by the client;

     METHOD
          the HTTP method used by the client (‘GET’, ‘PUT’, ‘DELETE’,
          ‘POST’, etc.);

     VERSION
          the HTTP version string (i.e.  ‘HTTP/1.1’);

     UPLOAD_DATA
          the data being uploaded (excluding headers):

          ‘POST’ data *will* be made available incrementally in
          UPLOAD_DATA; even if ‘POST’ data is available, the first time
          the callback is invoked there won’t be upload data, as this is
          done just after MHD parses the headers.  If supported by the
          client and the HTTP version, the application can at this point
          queue an error response to possibly avoid the upload entirely.
          If no response is generated, MHD will (if required)
          automatically send a 100 CONTINUE reply to the client.

          Afterwards, POST data will be passed to the callback to be
          processed incrementally by the application.  The application
          may return ‘MHD_NO’ to forcefully terminate the TCP connection
          without generating a proper HTTP response.  Once all of the
          upload data has been provided to the application, the
          application will be called again with 0 bytes of upload data.
          At this point, a response should be queued to complete the
          handling of the request.

     UPLOAD_DATA_SIZE
          set initially to the size of the UPLOAD_DATA provided; this
          callback must update this value to the number of bytes *NOT*
          processed; unless external select is used, the callback maybe
          required to process at least some data.  If the callback fails
          to process data in multi-threaded or internal-select mode and
          if the read-buffer is already at the maximum size that MHD is
          willing to use for reading (about half of the maximum amount
          of memory allowed for the connection), then MHD will abort
          handling the connection and return an internal server error to
          the client.  In order to avoid this, clients must be able to
          process upload data incrementally and reduce the value of
          ‘upload_data_size’.

     CON_CLS
          reference to a pointer, initially set to ‘NULL’, that this
          callback can set to some address and that will be preserved by
          MHD for future calls for this request;

          since the access handler may be called many times (i.e., for a
          ‘PUT’/‘POST’ operation with plenty of upload data) this allows
          the application to easily associate some request-specific
          state;

          if necessary, this state can be cleaned up in the global
          ‘MHD_RequestCompletedCallback’ (which can be set with the
          ‘MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED’).

 -- Function Pointer: void *MHD_RequestCompletedCallback (void *cls,
          struct MHD_Connectionconnection, void **con_cls, enum
          MHD_RequestTerminationCode toe)
     Signature of the callback used by MHD to notify the application
     about completed requests.

     CLS
          custom value selected at callback registration time;

     CONNECTION
          connection handle;

     CON_CLS
          value as set by the last call to the
          ‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback’;

     TOE
          reason for request termination see
          ‘MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED’.

 -- Function Pointer: enum MHD_Result *MHD_KeyValueIterator (void *cls,
          enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key, const char *value,
          size_t value_size)
     Iterator over key-value pairs.  This iterator can be used to
     iterate over all of the cookies, headers, or ‘POST’-data fields of
     a request, and also to iterate over the headers that have been
     added to a response.

     CLS
          custom value specified when iteration was triggered;

     KIND
          kind of the header we are looking at

     KEY
          key for the value, can be an empty string

     VALUE
          value corresponding value, can be NULL

     VALUE_SIZE
          number of bytes in ‘value’.  This argument was introduced in
          ‘MHD_VERSION’ 0x00096301 to allow applications to use binary
          zeros in values.  Applications using this argument must ensure
          that they are using a sufficiently recent version of MHD, i.e.
          by testing ‘MHD_get_version()’ for values above or equal to
          0.9.64.  Applications that do not need zeros in values and
          that want to compile without warnings against newer versions
          of MHD should not declare this argument and cast the function
          pointer argument to ‘MHD_KeyValueIterator’.

     Return ‘MHD_YES’ to continue iterating, ‘MHD_NO’ to abort the
     iteration.

 -- Function Pointer: ssize_t *MHD_ContentReaderCallback (void *cls,
          uint64_t pos, char *buf, size_t max)
     Callback used by MHD in order to obtain content.  The callback has
     to copy at most MAX bytes of content into BUF.  The total number of
     bytes that has been placed into BUF should be returned.

     Note that returning zero will cause MHD to try again.  Thus,
     returning zero should only be used in conjunction with
     ‘MHD_suspend_connection()’ to avoid busy waiting.

     While usually the callback simply returns the number of bytes
     written into BUF, there are two special return value:

     ‘MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM’ (-1) should be returned for the
     regular end of transmission (with chunked encoding, MHD will then
     terminate the chunk and send any HTTP footers that might be
     present; without chunked encoding and given an unknown response
     size, MHD will simply close the connection; note that while
     returning ‘MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM’ is not technically
     legal if a response size was specified, MHD accepts this and treats
     it just as ‘MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR’.

     ‘MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR’ (-2) is used to indicate a
     server error generating the response; this will cause MHD to simply
     close the connection immediately.  If a response size was given or
     if chunked encoding is in use, this will indicate an error to the
     client.  Note, however, that if the client does not know a response
     size and chunked encoding is not in use, then clients will not be
     able to tell the difference between
     ‘MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR’ and
     ‘MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM’.  This is not a limitation of
     MHD but rather of the HTTP protocol.

     CLS
          custom value selected at callback registration time;

     POS
          position in the datastream to access; note that if an
          ‘MHD_Response’ object is re-used, it is possible for the same
          content reader to be queried multiple times for the same data;
          however, if an ‘MHD_Response’ is not re-used, MHD guarantees
          that POS will be the sum of all non-negative return values
          obtained from the content reader so far.

     Return ‘-1’ on error (MHD will no longer try to read content and
     instead close the connection with the client).

 -- Function Pointer: void *MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback (void *cls)
     This method is called by MHD if we are done with a content reader.
     It should be used to free resources associated with the content
     reader.

 -- Function Pointer: enum MHD_Result *MHD_PostDataIterator (void *cls,
          enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key, const char
          *filename, const char *content_type, const char
          *transfer_encoding, const char *data, uint64_t off, size_t
          size)
     Iterator over key-value pairs where the value maybe made available
     in increments and/or may not be zero-terminated.  Used for
     processing ‘POST’ data.

     CLS
          custom value selected at callback registration time;

     KIND
          type of the value;

     KEY
          zero-terminated key for the value;

     FILENAME
          name of the uploaded file, ‘NULL’ if not known;

     CONTENT_TYPE
          mime-type of the data, ‘NULL’ if not known;

     TRANSFER_ENCODING
          encoding of the data, ‘NULL’ if not known;

     DATA
          pointer to size bytes of data at the specified offset;

     OFF
          offset of data in the overall value;

     SIZE
          number of bytes in data available.

     Return ‘MHD_YES’ to continue iterating, ‘MHD_NO’ to abort the
     iteration.

 -- Function Pointer: void* *MHD_WebSocketMallocCallback (size_t
          buf_len)
     This callback function is used internally by many websocket
     functions for allocating data.  By default ‘malloc’ is used.  You
     can use your own allocation function with
     ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’ if you wish to.  This can be useful
     for operating systems like Windows where ‘malloc’, ‘realloc’ and
     ‘free’ are compiler-dependent.  You can call the associated
     ‘malloc’ callback of a websocket stream with
     ‘MHD_websocket_malloc’.

     BUF_LEN
          size of the buffer to allocate in bytes.

     Return the pointer of the allocated buffer or ‘NULL’ on failure.

 -- Function Pointer: void* *MHD_WebSocketReallocCallback (void *buf,
          size_t new_buf_len)
     This callback function is used internally by many websocket
     functions for reallocating data.  By default ‘realloc’ is used.
     You can use your own reallocation function with
     ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’ if you wish to.  This can be useful
     for operating systems like Windows where ‘malloc’, ‘realloc’ and
     ‘free’ are compiler-dependent.  You can call the associated
     ‘realloc’ callback of a websocket stream with
     ‘MHD_websocket_realloc’.

     BUF
          current buffer, may be ‘NULL’;

     NEW_BUF_LEN
          new size of the buffer in bytes.

     Return the pointer of the reallocated buffer or ‘NULL’ on failure.
     On failure the old pointer must remain valid.

 -- Function Pointer: void *MHD_WebSocketFreeCallback (void *buf)
     This callback function is used internally by many websocket
     functions for freeing data.  By default ‘free’ is used.  You can
     use your own free function with ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’ if you
     wish to.  This can be useful for operating systems like Windows
     where ‘malloc’, ‘realloc’ and ‘free’ are compiler-dependent.  You
     can call the associated ‘free’ callback of a websocket stream with
     ‘MHD_websocket_free’.

     CLS
          current buffer to free, this may be ‘NULL’ then nothing
          happens.

 -- Function Pointer: size_t *MHD_WebSocketRandomNumberGenerator (void
          *cls, void* buf, size_t buf_len)
     This callback function is used for generating random numbers for
     masking payload data in client mode.  If you use websockets in
     server mode with _libmicrohttpd_ then you don’t need a random
     number generator, because the server doesn’t mask its outgoing
     messages.  However if you wish to use a websocket stream in client
     mode, you must pass this callback function to
     ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’.

     CLS
          closure specified in ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2’;
     BUF
          buffer to fill with random values;
     BUF_LEN
          size of buffer in bytes.

     Return the number of generated random bytes.  The return value
     should usually equal to buf_len.

5 Starting and stopping the server
**********************************

 -- Function: void MHD_set_panic_func (MHD_PanicCallback cb, void *cls)
     Set a handler for fatal errors.

     CB
          function to call if MHD encounters a fatal internal error.  If
          no handler was set explicitly, MHD will call ‘abort’.

     CLS
          closure argument for cb; the other arguments are the name of
          the source file, line number and a string describing the
          nature of the fatal error (which can be ‘NULL’)

 -- Function: struct MHD_Daemon * MHD_start_daemon (unsigned int flags,
          unsigned short port, MHD_AcceptPolicyCallback apc, void
          *apc_cls, MHD_AccessHandlerCallback dh, void *dh_cls, ...)
     Start a webserver on the given port.

     FLAGS
          OR-ed combination of ‘MHD_FLAG’ values;

     PORT
          port to bind to;

     APC
          callback to call to check which clients will be allowed to
          connect; you can pass ‘NULL’ in which case connections from
          any IP will be accepted;

     APC_CLS
          extra argument to APC;

     DH
          default handler for all URIs;

     DH_CLS
          extra argument to DH.

     Additional arguments are a list of options (type-value pairs,
     terminated with ‘MHD_OPTION_END’).  It is mandatory to use
     ‘MHD_OPTION_END’ as last argument, even when there are no
     additional arguments.

     Return ‘NULL’ on error, handle to daemon on success.

 -- Function: MHD_socket MHD_quiesce_daemon (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)
     Stop accepting connections from the listening socket.  Allows
     clients to continue processing, but stops accepting new
     connections.  Note that the caller is responsible for closing the
     returned socket; however, if MHD is run using threads (anything but
     external select mode), it must not be closed until AFTER
     ‘MHD_stop_daemon’ has been called (as it is theoretically possible
     that an existing thread is still using it).

     This function is useful in the special case that a listen socket is
     to be migrated to another process (i.e.  a newer version of the
     HTTP server) while existing connections should continue to be
     processed until they are finished.

     Return ‘-1’ on error (daemon not listening), the handle to the
     listen socket otherwise.

 -- Function: void MHD_stop_daemon (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)
     Shutdown an HTTP daemon.

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_run (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)
     Run webserver operations (without blocking unless in client
     callbacks).  This method should be called by clients in combination
     with ‘MHD_get_fdset()’ if the client-controlled ‘select’-method is
     used.

     This function will work for external ‘poll’ and ‘select’ mode.
     However, if using external ‘select’ mode, you may want to instead
     use ‘MHD_run_from_select’, as it is more efficient.

     DAEMON
          daemon to process connections of

     Return ‘MHD_YES’ on success, ‘MHD_NO’ if this daemon was not
     started with the right options for this call.

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_run_from_select (struct MHD_Daemon
          *daemon, const fd_set *read_fd_set, const fd_set
          *write_fd_set, const fd_set *except_fd_set)
     Run webserver operations given sets of ready socket handles.

     This method should be called by clients in combination with
     ‘MHD_get_fdset’ if the client-controlled (external) select method
     is used.

     You can use this function instead of ‘MHD_run’ if you called
     ‘select’ on the result from ‘MHD_get_fdset’.  File descriptors in
     the sets that are not controlled by MHD will be ignored.  Calling
     this function instead of ‘MHD_run’ is more efficient as MHD will
     not have to call ‘select’ again to determine which operations are
     ready.

     DAEMON
          daemon to process connections of
     READ_FD_SET
          set of descriptors that must be ready for reading without
          blocking
     WRITE_FD_SET
          set of descriptors that must be ready for writing without
          blocking
     EXCEPT_FD_SET
          ignored, can be NULL

     Return ‘MHD_YES’ on success, ‘MHD_NO’ on serious internal errors.

 -- Function: void MHD_add_connection (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon, int
          client_socket, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen)
     Add another client connection to the set of connections managed by
     MHD. This API is usually not needed (since MHD will accept inbound
     connections on the server socket).  Use this API in special cases,
     for example if your HTTP server is behind NAT and needs to connect
     out to the HTTP client, or if you are building a proxy.

     If you use this API in conjunction with a internal select or a
     thread pool, you must set the option ‘MHD_USE_ITC’ to ensure that
     the freshly added connection is immediately processed by MHD.

     The given client socket will be managed (and closed!)  by MHD after
     this call and must no longer be used directly by the application
     afterwards.

     DAEMON
          daemon that manages the connection
     CLIENT_SOCKET
          socket to manage (MHD will expect to receive an HTTP request
          from this socket next).
     ADDR
          IP address of the client
     ADDRLEN
          number of bytes in addr

     This function will return ‘MHD_YES’ on success, ‘MHD_NO’ if this
     daemon could not handle the connection (i.e.  malloc failed, etc).
     The socket will be closed in any case; ’errno’ is set to indicate
     further details about the error.

6 Implementing external ‘select’
********************************

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_get_fdset (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,
          fd_set * read_fd_set, fd_set * write_fd_set, fd_set *
          except_fd_set, int *max_fd)
     Obtain the ‘select()’ sets for this daemon.  The daemon’s socket is
     added to READ_FD_SET.  The list of currently existent connections
     is scanned and their file descriptors added to the correct set.

     When calling this function, FD_SETSIZE is assumed to be platform’s
     default.  If you changed FD_SETSIZE for your application, you
     should use ‘MHD_get_fdset2()’ instead.

     This function should only be called in when MHD is configured to
     use external select with ‘select()’ or with ‘epoll()’.  In the
     latter case, it will only add the single ‘epoll()’ file descriptor
     used by MHD to the sets.

     After the call completed successfully: the variable referenced by
     MAX_FD references the file descriptor with highest integer
     identifier.  The variable must be set to zero before invoking this
     function.

     Return ‘MHD_YES’ on success, ‘MHD_NO’ if: the arguments are invalid
     (example: ‘NULL’ pointers); this daemon was not started with the
     right options for this call.

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_get_fdset2 (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,
          fd_set * read_fd_set, fd_set * write_fd_set, fd_set *
          except_fd_set, int *max_fd, unsigned int fd_setsize)
     Like ‘MHD_get_fdset()’, except that you can manually specify the
     value of FD_SETSIZE used by your application.

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_get_timeout (struct MHD_Daemon
          *daemon, unsigned long long *timeout)
     Obtain timeout value for select for this daemon (only needed if
     connection timeout is used).  The returned value is how many
     milliseconds ‘select’ should at most block, not the timeout value
     set for connections.  This function must not be called if the
     ‘MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION’ mode is in use (since then it is
     not meaningful to ask for a timeout, after all, there is
     concurrenct activity).  The function must also not be called by
     user-code if ‘MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD’ is in use.  In the
     latter case, the behavior is undefined.

     DAEMON
          which daemon to obtain the timeout from.
     TIMEOUT
          will be set to the timeout (in milliseconds).

     Return ‘MHD_YES’ on success, ‘MHD_NO’ if timeouts are not used (or
     no connections exist that would necessitate the use of a timeout
     right now).

7 Handling requests
*******************

 -- Function: int MHD_get_connection_values (struct MHD_Connection
          *connection, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, MHD_KeyValueIterator
          iterator, void *iterator_cls)
     Get all the headers matching KIND from the request.  The KIND
     argument can be a bitmask, ORing the various header kinds that are
     requested.

     The ITERATOR callback is invoked once for each header, with
     ITERATOR_CLS as first argument.  After version 0.9.19, the headers
     are iterated in the same order as they were received from the
     network; previous versions iterated over the headers in reverse
     order.

     ‘MHD_get_connection_values’ returns the number of entries iterated
     over; this can be less than the number of headers if, while
     iterating, ITERATOR returns ‘MHD_NO’.

     ITERATOR can be ‘NULL’: in this case this function just counts and
     returns the number of headers.

     In the case of ‘MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND’, the VALUE argument will be
     ‘NULL’ if the URL contained a key without an equals operator.  For
     example, for a HTTP request to the URL “http://foo/bar?key”, the
     VALUE argument is ‘NULL’; in contrast, a HTTP request to the URL
     “http://foo/bar?key=”, the VALUE argument is the empty string.  The
     normal case is that the URL contains “http://foo/bar?key=value” in
     which case VALUE would be the string “value” and KEY would contain
     the string “key”.

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_set_connection_value (struct
          MHD_Connection *connection, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const
          char *key, const char *value)
     This function can be used to append an entry to the list of HTTP
     headers of a connection (so that the ‘MHD_get_connection_values
     function’ will return them – and the MHD PostProcessor will also
     see them).  This maybe required in certain situations (see Mantis
     #1399) where (broken) HTTP implementations fail to supply values
     needed by the post processor (or other parts of the application).

     This function MUST only be called from within the
     MHD_AccessHandlerCallback (otherwise, access maybe improperly
     synchronized).  Furthermore, the client must guarantee that the key
     and value arguments are 0-terminated strings that are NOT freed
     until the connection is closed.  (The easiest way to do this is by
     passing only arguments to permanently allocated strings.).

     CONNECTION is the connection for which the entry for KEY of the
     given KIND should be set to the given VALUE.

     The function returns ‘MHD_NO’ if the operation could not be
     performed due to insufficient memory and ‘MHD_YES’ on success.

 -- Function: const char * MHD_lookup_connection_value (struct
          MHD_Connection *connection, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const
          char *key)
     Get a particular header value.  If multiple values match the KIND,
     return one of them (the “first”, whatever that means).  KEY must
     reference a zero-terminated ASCII-coded string representing the
     header to look for: it is compared against the headers using
     (basically) ‘strcasecmp()’, so case is ignored.

 -- Function: const char * MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (struct
          MHD_Connection *connection, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const
          char *key, size_t key_size, const char **value_ptr, size_t
          *value_size_ptr)
     Get a particular header value.  If multiple values match the KIND,
     return one of them (the “first”, whatever that means).  KEY must
     reference an ASCII-coded string representing the header to look
     for: it is compared against the headers using (basically)
     ‘strncasecmp()’, so case is ignored.  The VALUE_PTR is set to the
     address of the value found, and VALUE_SIZE_PTR is set to the number
     of bytes in the value.

8 Building responses to requests
********************************

Response objects handling by MHD is asynchronous with respect to the
application execution flow.  Instances of the ‘MHD_Response’ structure
are not associated to a daemon and neither to a client connection: they
are managed with reference counting.

   In the simplest case: we allocate a new ‘MHD_Response’ structure for
each response, we use it once and finally we destroy it.

   MHD allows more efficient resources usages.

   Example: we allocate a new ‘MHD_Response’ structure for each response
*kind*, we use it every time we have to give that response and we
finally destroy it only when the daemon shuts down.

* Menu:

* microhttpd-response enqueue:: Enqueuing a response.
* microhttpd-response create::  Creating a response object.
* microhttpd-response headers:: Adding headers to a response.
* microhttpd-response options:: Setting response options.
* microhttpd-response inspect:: Inspecting a response object.
* microhttpd-response upgrade:: Creating a response for protocol upgrades.

8.1 Enqueuing a response
========================

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_queue_response (struct MHD_Connection
          *connection, unsigned int status_code, struct MHD_Response
          *response)
     Queue a response to be transmitted to the client as soon as
     possible but only after MHD_AccessHandlerCallback returns.  This
     function checks that it is legal to queue a response at this time
     for the given connection.  It also increments the internal
     reference counter for the response object (the counter will be
     decremented automatically once the response has been transmitted).

     CONNECTION
          the connection identifying the client;

     STATUS_CODE
          HTTP status code (i.e.  ‘200’ for OK);

     RESPONSE
          response to transmit.

     Return ‘MHD_YES’ on success or if message has been queued.  Return
     ‘MHD_NO’: if arguments are invalid (example: ‘NULL’ pointer); on
     error (i.e.  reply already sent).

 -- Function: void MHD_destroy_response (struct MHD_Response *response)
     Destroy a response object and associated resources (decrement the
     reference counter).  Note that MHD may keep some of the resources
     around if the response is still in the queue for some clients, so
     the memory may not necessarily be freed immediately.

   An explanation of reference counting(1):

  1. a ‘MHD_Response’ object is allocated:

          struct MHD_Response * response = MHD_create_response_from_buffer(...);
          /* here: reference counter = 1 */

  2. the ‘MHD_Response’ object is enqueued in a ‘MHD_Connection’:

          MHD_queue_response(connection, , response);
          /* here: reference counter = 2 */

  3. the creator of the response object discharges responsibility for
     it:

          MHD_destroy_response(response);
          /* here: reference counter = 1 */

  4. the daemon handles the connection sending the response’s data to
     the client then decrements the reference counter by calling
     ‘MHD_destroy_response()’: the counter’s value drops to zero and the
     ‘MHD_Response’ object is released.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note to readers acquainted to the Tcl API: reference counting on
‘MHD_Connection’ structures is handled in the same way as Tcl handles
‘Tcl_Obj’ structures through ‘Tcl_IncrRefCount()’ and
‘Tcl_DecrRefCount()’.

8.2 Creating a response object
==============================

 -- Function: struct MHD_Response * MHD_create_response_from_callback
          (uint64_t size, size_t block_size, MHD_ContentReaderCallback
          crc, void *crc_cls, MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback crfc)
     Create a response object.  The response object can be extended with
     header information and then it can be used any number of times.

     SIZE
          size of the data portion of the response, ‘-1’ for unknown;

     BLOCK_SIZE
          preferred block size for querying CRC (advisory only, MHD may
          still call CRC using smaller chunks); this is essentially the
          buffer size used for IO, clients should pick a value that is
          appropriate for IO and memory performance requirements;

     CRC
          callback to use to obtain response data;

     CRC_CLS
          extra argument to CRC;

     CRFC
          callback to call to free CRC_CLS resources.

     Return ‘NULL’ on error (i.e.  invalid arguments, out of memory).

 -- Function: struct MHD_Response * MHD_create_response_from_fd
          (uint64_t size, int fd)
     Create a response object.  The response object can be extended with
     header information and then it can be used any number of times.

     SIZE
          size of the data portion of the response (should be smaller or
          equal to the size of the file)

     FD
          file descriptor referring to a file on disk with the data;
          will be closed when response is destroyed; note that ’fd’ must
          be an actual file descriptor (not a pipe or socket) since MHD
          might use ’sendfile’ or ’seek’ on it.  The descriptor should
          be in blocking-IO mode.

     Return ‘NULL’ on error (i.e.  invalid arguments, out of memory).

 -- Function: struct MHD_Response * MHD_create_response_from_pipe
          (uint64_t size, int fd)
     Create a response object.  The response object can be extended with
     header information and then it can be used ONLY ONCE.

     FD
          file descriptor of the read-end of the pipe; will be closed
          when response is destroyed.  The descriptor should be in
          blocking-IO mode.

     Return ‘NULL’ on error (i.e.  out of memory).

 -- Function: struct MHD_Response *
          MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset (size_t size, int fd,
          off_t offset)
     Create a response object.  The response object can be extended with
     header information and then it can be used any number of times.
     Note that you need to be a bit careful about ‘off_t’ when writing
     this code.  Depending on your platform, MHD is likely to have been
     compiled with support for 64-bit files.  When you compile your own
     application, you must make sure that ‘off_t’ is also a 64-bit
     value.  If not, your compiler may pass a 32-bit value as ‘off_t’,
     which will result in 32-bits of garbage.

     If you use the autotools, use the ‘AC_SYS_LARGEFILE’ autoconf macro
     and make sure to include the generated ‘config.h’ file before
     ‘microhttpd.h’ to avoid problems.  If you do not have a build
     system and only want to run on a GNU/Linux system, you could also
     use
     #define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/stat.h>
     #include <fcntl.h>
     #include <microhttpd.h>
     to ensure 64-bit ‘off_t’.  Note that if your operating system does
     not support 64-bit files, MHD will be compiled with a 32-bit
     ‘off_t’ (in which case the above would be wrong).

     SIZE
          size of the data portion of the response (number of bytes to
          transmit from the file starting at offset).

     FD
          file descriptor referring to a file on disk with the data;
          will be closed when response is destroyed; note that ’fd’ must
          be an actual file descriptor (not a pipe or socket) since MHD
          might use ’sendfile’ or ’seek’ on it.  The descriptor should
          be in blocking-IO mode.

     OFFSET
          offset to start reading from in the file

     Return ‘NULL’ on error (i.e.  invalid arguments, out of memory).

 -- Function: struct MHD_Response * MHD_create_response_from_buffer
          (size_t size, void *data, enum MHD_ResponseMemoryMode mode)
     Create a response object.  The response object can be extended with
     header information and then it can be used any number of times.

     SIZE
          size of the data portion of the response;

     BUFFER
          the data itself;

     MODE
          memory management options for buffer; use
          MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT if the buffer is static/global memory,
          use MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_FREE if the buffer is heap-allocated and
          should be freed by MHD and MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_COPY if the buffer
          is in transient memory (i.e.  on the stack) and must be copied
          by MHD;

     Return ‘NULL’ on error (i.e.  invalid arguments, out of memory).

 -- Function: struct MHD_Response *
          MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback (size_t
          size, void *data, MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback crfc)
     Create a response object.  The buffer at the end must be free’d by
     calling the CRFC function.

     SIZE
          size of the data portion of the response;

     BUFFER
          the data itself;

     CRFC
          function to call at the end to free memory allocated at
          BUFFER.

     Return ‘NULL’ on error (i.e.  invalid arguments, out of memory).

 -- Function: struct MHD_Response * MHD_create_response_from_data
          (size_t size, void *data, int must_free, int must_copy)
     Create a response object.  The response object can be extended with
     header information and then it can be used any number of times.
     This function is deprecated, use ‘MHD_create_response_from_buffer’
     instead.

     SIZE
          size of the data portion of the response;

     DATA
          the data itself;

     MUST_FREE
          if true: MHD should free data when done;

     MUST_COPY
          if true: MHD allocates a block of memory and use it to make a
          copy of DATA embedded in the returned ‘MHD_Response’
          structure; handling of the embedded memory is responsibility
          of MHD; DATA can be released anytime after this call returns.

     Return ‘NULL’ on error (i.e.  invalid arguments, out of memory).

   Example: create a response from a statically allocated string:

     const char * data = "<html><body><p>Error!</p></body></html>";

     struct MHD_Connection * connection = ...;
     struct MHD_Response *   response;

     response = MHD_create_response_from_buffer (strlen(data), data,
                                                 MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT);
     MHD_queue_response(connection, 404, response);
     MHD_destroy_response(response);

 -- Function: struct MHD_Response * MHD_create_response_from_iovec
          (const struct MHD_IoVec *iov, int iovcnt,
          MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback crfc, void *cls)
     Create a response object from an array of memory buffers.  The
     response object can be extended with header information and then be
     used any number of times.
     IOV
          the array for response data buffers, an internal copy of this
          will be made; however, note that the data pointed to by the
          IOV is not copied and must be preserved unchanged at the given
          locations until the response is no longer in use and the CRFC
          is called;

     IOVCNT
          the number of elements in IOV;

     CRFC
          the callback to call to free resources associated with IOV;

     CLS
          the argument to CRFC;

     Return ‘NULL’ on error (i.e.  invalid arguments, out of memory).

8.3 Adding headers to a response
================================

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_add_response_header (struct
          MHD_Response *response, const char *header, const char
          *content)
     Add a header line to the response.  The strings referenced by
     HEADER and CONTENT must be zero-terminated and they are duplicated
     into memory blocks embedded in RESPONSE.

     Notice that the strings must not hold newlines, carriage returns or
     tab chars.

     MHD_add_response_header() prevents applications from setting a
     “Transfer-Encoding” header to values other than “identity” or
     “chunked” as other transfer encodings are not supported by MHD.
     Note that usually MHD will pick the transfer encoding correctly
     automatically, but applications can use the header to force a
     particular behavior.

     MHD_add_response_header() also prevents applications from setting a
     “Content-Length” header.  MHD will automatically set a correct
     “Content-Length” header if it is possible and allowed.

     Return ‘MHD_NO’ on error (i.e.  invalid header or content format or
     memory allocation error).

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_add_response_footer (struct
          MHD_Response *response, const char *footer, const char
          *content)
     Add a footer line to the response.  The strings referenced by
     FOOTER and CONTENT must be zero-terminated and they are duplicated
     into memory blocks embedded in RESPONSE.

     Notice that the strings must not hold newlines, carriage returns or
     tab chars.  You can add response footers at any time before
     signalling the end of the response to MHD (not just before calling
     ’MHD_queue_response’).  Footers are useful for adding cryptographic
     checksums to the reply or to signal errors encountered during data
     generation.  This call was introduced in MHD 0.9.3.

     Return ‘MHD_NO’ on error (i.e.  invalid header or content format or
     memory allocation error).

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_del_response_header (struct
          MHD_Response *response, const char *header, const char
          *content)
     Delete a header (or footer) line from the response.  Return
     ‘MHD_NO’ on error (arguments are invalid or no such header known).

8.4 Setting response options
============================

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_set_response_options (struct
          MHD_Response *response, enum MHD_ResponseFlags flags, ...)
     Set special flags and options for a response.

     Calling this functions sets the given flags and options for the
     response.

     RESPONSE
          which response should be modified;

     FLAGS
          flags to set for the response;

     Additional arguments are a list of options (type-value pairs,
     terminated with ‘MHD_RO_END’).  It is mandatory to use ‘MHD_RO_END’
     as last argument, even when there are no additional arguments.

     Return ‘MHD_NO’ on error, ‘MHD_YES’ on success.

8.5 Inspecting a response object
================================

 -- Function: int MHD_get_response_headers (struct MHD_Response
          *response, MHD_KeyValueIterator iterator, void *iterator_cls)
     Get all of the headers added to a response.

     Invoke the ITERATOR callback for each header in the response, using
     ITERATOR_CLS as first argument.  Return number of entries iterated
     over.  ITERATOR can be ‘NULL’: in this case the function just
     counts headers.

     ITERATOR should not modify the its key and value arguments, unless
     we know what we are doing.

 -- Function: const char * MHD_get_response_header (struct MHD_Response
          *response, const char *key)
     Find and return a pointer to the value of a particular header from
     the response.  KEY must reference a zero-terminated string
     representing the header to look for.  The search is case sensitive.
     Return ‘NULL’ if header does not exist or KEY is ‘NULL’.

     We should not modify the value, unless we know what we are doing.

8.6 Creating a response for protocol upgrades
=============================================

With RFC 2817 a mechanism to switch protocols within HTTP was
introduced.  Here, a client sends a request with a “Connection: Upgrade”
header.  The server responds with a “101 Switching Protocols” response
header, after which the two parties begin to speak a different
(non-HTTP) protocol over the TCP connection.

   This mechanism is used for upgrading HTTP 1.1 connections to HTTP2 or
HTTPS, as well as for implementing WebSockets.  Which protocol upgrade
is performed is negotiated between server and client in additional
headers, in particular the “Upgrade” header.

   MHD supports switching protocols using this mechanism only if the
‘MHD_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME’ flag has been set when starting the daemon.
If this flag has been set, applications can upgrade a connection by
queueing a response (using the ‘MHD_HTTP_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS’ status
code) which must have been created with the following function:

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_create_response_for_upgrade
          (MHD_UpgradeHandler upgrade_handler, void
          *upgrade_handler_cls)
     Create a response suitable for switching protocols.  Returns
     ‘MHD_YES’ on success.  ‘upgrade_handler’ must not be ‘NULL’.

     When creating this type of response, the “Connection: Upgrade”
     header will be set automatically for you.  MHD requires that you
     additionally set an “Upgrade:” header.  The “Upgrade” header must
     simply exist, the specific value is completely up to the
     application.

   The ‘upgrade_handler’ argument to the above has the following type:

 -- Function Pointer: void *MHD_UpgradeHandler (void *cls, struct
          MHD_Connection *connection, const char *extra_in, size_t
          extra_in_size, MHD_socket sock, struct
          MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh)
     This function will be called once MHD has transmitted the header of
     the response to the connection that is being upgraded.  At this
     point, the application is expected to take over the socket ‘sock’
     and speak the non-HTTP protocol to which the connection was
     upgraded.  MHD will no longer use the socket; this includes
     handling timeouts.  The application must call ‘MHD_upgrade_action’
     with an upgrade action of ‘MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE’ when it is
     done processing the connection to close the socket.  The
     application must not call ‘MHD_stop_daemon’ on the respective
     daemon as long as it is still handling the connection.  The
     arguments given to the ‘upgrade_handler’ have the following
     meaning:

     CLS
          matches the ‘upgrade_handler_cls’ that was given to
          ‘MHD_create_response_for_upgrade’
     CONNECTION
          identifies the connection that is being upgraded;

     CON_CLS
          last value left in ‘*con_cls‘ in the
          ‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback‘

     EXTRA_IN
          buffer of bytes MHD read “by accident” from the socket
          already.  This can happen if the client eagerly transmits more
          than just the HTTP request.  The application should treat
          these as if it had read them from the socket.

     EXTRA_IN_SIZE
          number of bytes in ‘extra_in’

     SOCK
          the socket which the application can now use directly for some
          bi-directional communication with the client.  The application
          can henceforth use ‘recv()’ and ‘send()’ or ‘read()’ and
          ‘write()’ system calls on the socket.  However, ‘ioctl()’ and
          ‘setsockopt()’ functions will not work as expected when using
          HTTPS. Such operations may be supported in the future via
          ‘MHD_upgrade_action’.  Most importantly, the application must
          never call ‘close()’ on this socket.  Closing the socket must
          be done using ‘MHD_upgrade_action’.  However, while close is
          forbidden, the application may call ‘shutdown()’ on the
          socket.

     URH
          argument for calls to ‘MHD_upgrade_action’.  Applications must
          eventually use this function to perform the ‘close()’ action
          on the socket.

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_upgrade_action (struct
          MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh, enum MHD_UpgradeAction action,
          ...)
     Perform special operations related to upgraded connections.

     URH
          identifies the upgraded connection to perform an action on

     ACTION
          specifies the action to perform; further arguments to the
          function depend on the specifics of the action.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_UpgradeAction
     Set of actions to be performed on upgraded connections.  Passed as
     an argument to ‘MHD_upgrade_action()’.

     ‘MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE’
          Closes the connection.  Must be called once the application is
          done with the client.  Takes no additional arguments.
     ‘MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CORK_ON’
          Enable corking on the underlying socket.
     ‘MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CORK_OFF’
          Disable corking on the underlying socket.

9 Flow control.
***************

Sometimes it may be possible that clients upload data faster than an
application can process it, or that an application needs an extended
period of time to generate a response.  If
‘MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION’ is used, applications can simply deal
with this by performing their logic within the thread and thus
effectively blocking connection processing by MHD. In all other modes,
blocking logic must not be placed within the callbacks invoked by MHD as
this would also block processing of other requests, as a single thread
may be responsible for tens of thousands of connections.

   Instead, applications using thread modes other than
‘MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION’ should use the following functions to
perform flow control.

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_suspend_connection (struct
          MHD_Connection *connection)
     Suspend handling of network data for a given connection.  This can
     be used to dequeue a connection from MHD’s event loop (external
     select, internal select or thread pool; not applicable to
     thread-per-connection!)  for a while.

     If you use this API in conjunction with a internal select or a
     thread pool, you must set the option ‘MHD_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME’ to
     ensure that a resumed connection is immediately processed by MHD.

     Suspended connections continue to count against the total number of
     connections allowed (per daemon, as well as per IP, if such limits
     are set).  Suspended connections will NOT time out; timeouts will
     restart when the connection handling is resumed.  While a
     connection is suspended, MHD will not detect disconnects by the
     client.

     The only safe time to suspend a connection is from the
     ‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback’ or from the respective
     ‘MHD_ContentReaderCallback’ (but in this case the response object
     must not be shared among multiple connections).

     When suspending from the ‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback’ you MUST
     afterwards return ‘MHD_YES’ from the access handler callback (as
     MHD_NO would imply to both close and suspend the connection, which
     is not allowed).

     Finally, it is an API violation to call ‘MHD_stop_daemon’ while
     having suspended connections (this will at least create memory and
     socket leaks or lead to undefined behavior).  You must explicitly
     resume all connections before stopping the daemon.

     CONNECTION
          the connection to suspend

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_resume_connection (struct
          MHD_Connection *connection)
     Resume handling of network data for suspended connection.  It is
     safe to resume a suspended connection at any time.  Calling this
     function on a connection that was not previously suspended will
     result in undefined behavior.

     If you are using this function in “external” select mode, you must
     make sure to run ‘MHD_run’ afterwards (before again calling
     ‘MHD_get_fdset’), as otherwise the change may not be reflected in
     the set returned by ‘MHD_get_fdset’ and you may end up with a
     connection that is stuck until the next network activity.

     You can check whether a connection is currently suspended using
     ‘MHD_get_connection_info’ by querying for
     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_CONNECTION_SUSPENDED’.

     CONNECTION
          the connection to resume

10 Utilizing Authentication
***************************

MHD support three types of client authentication.

   Basic authentication uses a simple authentication method based on
BASE64 algorithm.  Username and password are exchanged in clear between
the client and the server, so this method must only be used for
non-sensitive content or when the session is protected with https.  When
using basic authentication MHD will have access to the clear password,
possibly allowing to create a chained authentication toward an external
authentication server.

   Digest authentication uses a one-way authentication method based on
MD5 hash algorithm.  Only the hash will transit over the network, hence
protecting the user password.  The nonce will prevent replay attacks.
This method is appropriate for general use, especially when https is not
used to encrypt the session.

   Client certificate authentication uses a X.509 certificate from the
client.  This is the strongest authentication mechanism but it requires
the use of HTTPS. Client certificate authentication can be used
simultaneously with Basic or Digest Authentication in order to provide a
two levels authentication (like for instance separate machine and user
authentication).  A code example for using client certificates is
presented in the MHD tutorial.

10.2 Using Digest Authentication
================================

MHD supports MD5 (deprecated by IETF) and SHA-256 hash algorithms for
digest authentication.  The ‘MHD_DigestAuthAlgorithm’ enumeration is
used to specify which algorithm should be used.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_DigestAuthAlgorithm
     Which digest algorithm should be used.  Must be used consistently.

     ‘MHD_DIGEST_ALG_AUTO’
          Have MHD pick an algorithm currently considered secure.  For
          now defaults to SHA-256.

     ‘MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5’
          Force use of (deprecated, ancient, insecure) MD5.

     ‘MHD_DIGEST_ALG_SHA256’
          Force use of SHA-256.

 -- Function: char * MHD_digest_auth_get_username (struct MHD_Connection
          *connection)
     Find and return a pointer to the username value from the request
     header.  Return ‘NULL’ if the value is not found or header does not
     exist.  If returned value is not ‘NULL’, the value must be
     ‘MHD_free()’’ed.

     the password, most probably it will be the result of a lookup of
     the username against a local database.

     invalid.  Most of the time it is sound to specify 300 seconds as
     its values.

                                ‘POST’ processor.

MHD provides the post processor API to make it easier for applications
to parse the data of a client’s ‘POST’ request: the
‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback’ will be invoked multiple times to process
data as it arrives; at each invocation a new chunk of data must be
processed.  The arguments UPLOAD_DATA and UPLOAD_DATA_SIZE are used to
reference the chunk of data.

   When ‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback’ is invoked for a new connection: its
‘*CON_CLS’ argument is set to ‘NULL’.  When ‘POST’ data comes in the
upload buffer it is *mandatory* to use the CON_CLS to store a reference
to per-connection data.  The fact that the pointer was initially ‘NULL’
can be used to detect that this is a new request.

   One method to detect that a new connection was established is to set
‘*con_cls’ to an unused integer:

     int
     access_handler (void *cls,
                     struct MHD_Connection * connection,
                     const char *url,
                     const char *method, const char *version,
                     const char *upload_data, size_t *upload_data_size,
                     void **con_cls)
     {
       static int old_connection_marker;
       int new_connection = (NULL == *con_cls);

       if (new_connection)
         {
           /* new connection with POST */
           *con_cls = &old_connection_marker;
         }

       ...
     }

In contrast to the previous example, for ‘POST’ requests in particular,
it is more common to use the value of ‘*con_cls’ to keep track of actual
state used during processing, such as the post processor (or a struct
containing a post processor):

     int
     access_handler (void *cls,
                     struct MHD_Connection * connection,
                     const char *url,
                     const char *method, const char *version,
                     const char *upload_data, size_t *upload_data_size,
                     void **con_cls)
     {
       struct MHD_PostProcessor * pp = *con_cls;

       if (pp == NULL)
         {
           pp = MHD_create_post_processor(connection, ...);
           *con_cls = pp;
           return MHD_YES;
         }
       if (*upload_data_size)
         {
           MHD_post_process(pp, upload_data, *upload_data_size);
           *upload_data_size = 0;
           return MHD_YES;
         }
       else
         {
           MHD_destroy_post_processor(pp);
           return MHD_queue_response(...);
         }
     }

   Note that the callback from ‘MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED’ should be
used to destroy the post processor.  This cannot be done inside of the
access handler since the connection may not always terminate normally.

11.1 Programming interface for the ‘POST’ processor
===================================================

 -- Function: struct MHD_PostProcessor * MHD_create_post_processor
          (struct MHD_Connection *connection, size_t buffer_size,
          MHD_PostDataIterator iterator, void *iterator_cls)
     Create a PostProcessor.  A PostProcessor can be used to
     (incrementally) parse the data portion of a ‘POST’ request.

     CONNECTION
          the connection on which the ‘POST’ is happening (used to
          determine the ‘POST’ format);

     BUFFER_SIZE
          maximum number of bytes to use for internal buffering (used
          only for the parsing, specifically the parsing of the keys).
          A tiny value (256-1024) should be sufficient; do *NOT* use a
          value smaller than 256; for good performance, use 32k or 64k
          (i.e.  65536).

     ITERATOR
          iterator to be called with the parsed data; must *NOT* be
          ‘NULL’;

     ITERATOR_CLS
          custom value to be used as first argument to ITERATOR.

     Return ‘NULL’ on error (out of memory, unsupported encoding),
     otherwise a PP handle.

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_post_process (struct MHD_PostProcessor
          *pp, const char *post_data, size_t post_data_len)
     Parse and process ‘POST’ data.  Call this function when ‘POST’ data
     is available (usually during an ‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback’) with
     the UPLOAD_DATA and UPLOAD_DATA_SIZE.  Whenever possible, this will
     then cause calls to the ‘MHD_IncrementalKeyValueIterator’.

     PP
          the post processor;

     POST_DATA
          POST_DATA_LEN bytes of ‘POST’ data;

     POST_DATA_LEN
          length of POST_DATA.

     Return ‘MHD_YES’ on success, ‘MHD_NO’ on error (out-of-memory,
     iterator aborted, parse error).

 -- Function: enum MHD_Result MHD_destroy_post_processor (struct
          MHD_PostProcessor *pp)
     Release PostProcessor resources.  After this function is being
     called, the PostProcessor is guaranteed to no longer call its
     iterator.  There is no special call to the iterator to indicate the
     end of the post processing stream.  After destroying the
     PostProcessor, the programmer should perform any necessary work to
     complete the processing of the iterator.

     Return ‘MHD_YES’ if processing completed nicely, ‘MHD_NO’ if there
     were spurious characters or formatting problems with the post
     request.  It is common to ignore the return value of this function.

12.1 Obtaining state information about an MHD daemon
====================================================

 -- Function: const union MHD_DaemonInfo * MHD_get_daemon_info (struct
          MHD_Daemon *daemon, enum MHD_DaemonInfoType infoType, ...)
     Obtain information about the given daemon.  This function is
     currently not fully implemented.

     DAEMON
          the daemon about which information is desired;

     INFOTYPE
          type of information that is desired

     ...
          additional arguments about the desired information (depending
          on infoType)

     Returns a union with the respective member (depending on infoType)
     set to the desired information), or ‘NULL’ in case the desired
     information is not available or applicable.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_DaemonInfoType
     Values of this enum are used to specify what information about a
     daemon is desired.
     ‘MHD_DAEMON_INFO_KEY_SIZE’
          Request information about the key size for a particular cipher
          algorithm.  The cipher algorithm should be passed as an extra
          argument (of type ’enum MHD_GNUTLS_CipherAlgorithm’).  No
          longer supported, using this value will cause
          ‘MHD_get_daemon_info’ to return NULL.

     ‘MHD_DAEMON_INFO_MAC_KEY_SIZE’
          Request information about the key size for a particular cipher
          algorithm.  The cipher algorithm should be passed as an extra
          argument (of type ’enum MHD_GNUTLS_HashAlgorithm’).  No longer
          supported, using this value will cause ‘MHD_get_daemon_info’
          to return NULL.

     ‘MHD_DAEMON_INFO_LISTEN_FD’
          Request the file-descriptor number that MHD is using to listen
          to the server socket.  This can be useful if no port was
          specified and a client needs to learn what port is actually
          being used by MHD. No extra arguments should be passed.

     ‘MHD_DAEMON_INFO_EPOLL_FD’
          Request the file-descriptor number that MHD is using for
          epoll.  If the build is not supporting epoll, NULL is
          returned; if we are using a thread pool or this daemon was not
          started with ‘MHD_USE_EPOLL’, (a pointer to) -1 is returned.
          If we are using ‘MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD’ or are in
          ’external’ select mode, the internal epoll FD is returned.
          This function must be used in external select mode with epoll
          to obtain the FD to call epoll on.  No extra arguments should
          be passed.

     ‘MHD_DAEMON_INFO_CURRENT_CONNECTIONS’
          Request the number of current connections handled by the
          daemon.  No extra arguments should be passed and a pointer to
          a ‘union MHD_DaemonInfo’ value is returned, with the
          ‘num_connections’ member of type ‘unsigned int’ set to the
          number of active connections.

          Note that in multi-threaded or internal-select mode, the real
          number of current connections may already be different when
          ‘MHD_get_daemon_info’ returns.  The number of current
          connections can be used (even in multi-threaded and
          internal-select mode) after ‘MHD_quiesce_daemon’ to detect
          whether all connections have been handled.

12.2 Obtaining state information about a connection
===================================================

 -- Function: const union MHD_ConnectionInfo * MHD_get_connection_info
          (struct MHD_Connection *connection, enum
          MHD_ConnectionInfoType infoType, ...)
     Obtain information about the given connection.

     CONNECTION
          the connection about which information is desired;

     INFOTYPE
          type of information that is desired

     ...
          additional arguments about the desired information (depending
          on infoType)

     Returns a union with the respective member (depending on infoType)
     set to the desired information), or ‘NULL’ in case the desired
     information is not available or applicable.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_ConnectionInfoType
     Values of this enum are used to specify what information about a
     connection is desired.

     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_CIPHER_ALGO’
          What cipher algorithm is being used (HTTPS connections only).
          ‘NULL’ is returned for non-HTTPS connections.

          Takes no extra arguments.

     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_PROTOCOL,’
          Allows finding out the TLS/SSL protocol used (HTTPS
          connections only).  ‘NULL’ is returned for non-HTTPS
          connections.

          Takes no extra arguments.

     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_CLIENT_ADDRESS’
          Returns information about the address of the client.  Returns
          essentially a ‘struct sockaddr **’ (since the API returns a
          ‘union MHD_ConnectionInfo *’ and that union contains a ‘struct
          sockaddr *’).

          Takes no extra arguments.

     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_GNUTLS_SESSION,’
          Takes no extra arguments.  Allows access to the underlying
          GNUtls session, including access to the underlying GNUtls
          client certificate (HTTPS connections only).  Takes no extra
          arguments.  ‘NULL’ is returned for non-HTTPS connections.

          Takes no extra arguments.

     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_GNUTLS_CLIENT_CERT,’
          Dysfunctional (never implemented, deprecated).  Use
          MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_GNUTLS_SESSION to get the
          ‘gnutls_session_t’ and then call
          ‘gnutls_certificate_get_peers()’.

     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_DAEMON’
          Returns information about ‘struct MHD_Daemon’ which manages
          this connection.

          Takes no extra arguments.

     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_CONNECTION_FD’
          Returns the file descriptor (usually a TCP socket) associated
          with this connection (in the “connect-fd” member of the
          returned struct).  Note that manipulating the descriptor
          directly can have problematic consequences (as in, break
          HTTP). Applications might use this access to manipulate TCP
          options, for example to set the “TCP-NODELAY” option for
          COMET-like applications.  Note that MHD will set TCP-CORK
          after sending the HTTP header and clear it after finishing the
          footers automatically (if the platform supports it).  As the
          connection callbacks are invoked in between, those might be
          used to set different values for TCP-CORK and TCP-NODELAY in
          the meantime.

          Takes no extra arguments.

     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_CONNECTION_SUSPENDED’
          Returns pointer to an integer that is ‘MHD_YES’ if the
          connection is currently suspended (and thus can be safely
          resumed) and ‘MHD_NO’ otherwise.

          Takes no extra arguments.

     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_SOCKET_CONTEXT’
          Returns the client-specific pointer to a ‘void *’ that was
          (possibly) set during a ‘MHD_NotifyConnectionCallback’ when
          the socket was first accepted.  Note that this is NOT the same
          as the ‘con_cls’ argument of the ‘MHD_AccessHandlerCallback’.
          The ‘con_cls’ is fresh for each HTTP request, while the
          ‘socket_context’ is fresh for each socket.

          Takes no extra arguments.

     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT’
          Returns pointer to an ‘unsigned int’ that is the current
          timeout used for the connection (in seconds, 0 for no
          timeout).  Note that while suspended connections will not
          timeout, the timeout value returned for suspended connections
          will be the timeout that the connection will use after it is
          resumed, and thus might not be zero.

          Takes no extra arguments.

     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_REQUEST_HEADER_SIZE’
          Returns pointer to an ‘size_t’ that represents the size of the
          HTTP header received from the client.  Only valid after the
          first callback to the access handler.

          Takes no extra arguments.

     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_HTTP_STATUS’
          Returns the HTTP status code of the response that was queued.
          Returns NULL if no response was queued yet.

          Takes no extra arguments.

12.3 Setting custom options for an individual connection
========================================================

 -- Function: int MHD_set_connection_option (struct MHD_Connection
          *daemon, enum MHD_CONNECTION_OPTION option, ...)
     Set a custom option for the given connection.

     CONNECTION
          the connection for which an option should be set or modified;

     OPTION
          option to set

     ...
          additional arguments for the option (depending on option)

     Returns ‘MHD_YES’ on success, ‘MHD_NO’ for errors (i.e.  option
     argument invalid or option unknown).

 -- Enumeration: MHD_CONNECTION_OPTION
     Values of this enum are used to specify which option for a
     connection should be changed.

     ‘MHD_CONNECTION_OPTION_TIMEOUT’
          Set a custom timeout for the given connection.  Specified as
          the number of seconds, given as an ‘unsigned int’.  Use zero
          for no timeout.

     ‘MHD_FEATURE_SHUTDOWN_LISTEN_SOCKET’
          Get whether shutdown on listen socket to signal other threads
          is supported.  If not supported flag MHD_USE_ITC is
          automatically forced.

     ‘MHD_FEATURE_SOCKETPAIR’
          Get whether a ‘socketpair()’ is used internally instead of a
          ‘pipe()’ to signal other threads.

     ‘MHD_FEATURE_TCP_FASTOPEN’
          Get whether TCP Fast Open is supported.  If supported then

          ‘MHD_destroy_post_processor()’ can be used.

     ‘MHD_FEATURE_SENDFILE’
          Get whether ‘sendfile()’ is supported.

 -- Function: int MHD_is_feature_supported (enum MHD_FEATURE feature)
     Get information about supported MHD features.  Indicate that MHD
     was compiled with or without support for particular feature.  Some
     features require additional support by the kernel.  However, kernel
     support is not checked by this function.

     FEATURE
          type of requested information

     Returns ‘MHD_YES’ if the feature is supported, and ‘MHD_NO’ if not.

13.2 Unescape strings
=====================

 -- Function: size_t MHD_http_unescape (char *val)
     Process escape sequences (’%HH’) Updates val in place; the result
     should be UTF-8 encoded and cannot be larger than the input.  The
     result must also still be 0-terminated.

     VAL
          value to unescape (modified in the process), must be a
          0-terminated UTF-8 string.

     Returns length of the resulting val (‘strlen(val)’ may be shorter
     afterwards due to elimination of escape sequences).

14.1 Websocket handshake functions
==================================

 -- Function: enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS MHD_websocket_check_http_version
          (const char* http_version)
     Checks the HTTP version of the incoming request.  Websocket
     requests are only allowed for HTTP/1.1 or above.

     HTTP_VERSION
          The value of the ‘version’ parameter of your ‘access_handler’
          callback.  If you pass ‘NULL’ then this is handled like a not
          matching HTTP version.

     Returns 0 when the HTTP version is valid for a websocket request
     and a value less than zero when the HTTP version isn’t valid for a
     websocket request.  Can be compared with ‘enum
     MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS’.

 -- Function: enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS
          MHD_websocket_check_connection_header (const char*
          connection_header)
     Checks the value of the ‘Connection’ HTTP request header.
     Websocket requests require the token ‘Upgrade’ in the ‘Connection’
     HTTP request header.

     CONNECTION_HEADER
          Value of the ‘Connection’ request header.  You can get this
          request header value by passing ‘MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION’
          to ‘MHD_lookup_connection_value()’.  If you pass ‘NULL’ then
          this is handled like a not matching ‘Connection’ header value.

     Returns 0 when the ‘Connection’ header is valid for a websocket
     request and a value less than zero when the ‘Connection’ header
     isn’t valid for a websocket request.  Can be compared with ‘enum
     MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS’.

 -- Function: enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS
          MHD_websocket_check_upgrade_header (const char*
          upgrade_header)
     Checks the value of the ‘Upgrade’ HTTP request header.  Websocket
     requests require the value ‘websocket’ in the ‘Upgrade’ HTTP
     request header.

     UPGRADE_HEADER
          Value of the ‘Upgrade’ request header.  You can get this
          request header value by passing ‘MHD_HTTP_HEADER_UPGRADE’ to
          ‘MHD_lookup_connection_value()’.  If you pass ‘NULL’ then this
          is handled like a not matching ‘Upgrade’ header value.

     Returns 0 when the ‘Upgrade’ header is valid for a websocket
     request and a value less than zero when the ‘Upgrade’ header isn’t
     valid for a websocket request.  Can be compared with ‘enum
     MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS’.

 -- Function: enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS
          MHD_websocket_check_version_header (const char*
          version_header)
     Checks the value of the ‘Sec-WebSocket-Version’ HTTP request
     header.  Websocket requests require the value ‘13’ in the
     ‘Sec-WebSocket-Version’ HTTP request header.

     VERSION_HEADER
          Value of the ‘Sec-WebSocket-Version’ request header.  You can
          get this request header value by passing
          ‘MHD_HTTP_HEADER_SEC_WEBSOCKET_VERSION’ to
          ‘MHD_lookup_connection_value()’.  If you pass ‘NULL’ then this
          is handled like a not matching ‘Sec-WebSocket-Version’ header
          value.

     Returns 0 when the ‘Sec-WebSocket-Version’ header is valid for a
     websocket request and a value less than zero when the
     ‘Sec-WebSocket-Version’ header isn’t valid for a websocket request.
     Can be compared with ‘enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS’.

 -- Function: enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS
          MHD_websocket_create_accept_header (const char*
          sec_websocket_key, char* sec_websocket_accept)
     Checks the value of the ‘Sec-WebSocket-Key’ HTTP request header and
     generates the value for the ‘Sec-WebSocket-Accept’ HTTP response
     header.  The generated value must be sent to the client.

     SEC_WEBSOCKET_KEY
          Value of the ‘Sec-WebSocket-Key’ request header.  You can get
          this request header value by passing
          ‘MHD_HTTP_HEADER_SEC_WEBSOCKET_KEY’ to
          ‘MHD_lookup_connection_value()’.  If you pass ‘NULL’ then this
          is handled like a not matching ‘Sec-WebSocket-Key’ header
          value.

     SEC_WEBSOCKET_ACCEPT
          Response buffer, which will receive the generated value for
          the ‘Sec-WebSocket-Accept’ HTTP response header.  This buffer
          must be at least 29 bytes long and will contain the response
          value plus a terminating ‘NUL’ character on success.  Must not
          be ‘NULL’.  You can add this HTTP header to your response by
          passing ‘MHD_HTTP_HEADER_SEC_WEBSOCKET_ACCEPT’ to
          ‘MHD_add_response_header()’.

     Returns 0 when the ‘Sec-WebSocket-Key’ header was not empty and a
     result value for the ‘Sec-WebSocket-Accept’ was calculated.  A
     value less than zero is returned when the ‘Sec-WebSocket-Key’
     header isn’t valid for a websocket request or when any error
     occurred.  Can be compared with ‘enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS’.

14.3 Websocket decode functions
===============================

 -- Function: enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS MHD_websocket_decode (struct
          MHD_WebSocketStream* ws, const char* streambuf, size_t
          streambuf_len, size_t* streambuf_read_len, char** payload,
          size_t* payload_len)
     Decodes a byte sequence for a websocket stream.  Decoding is done
     until either a frame is complete or the end of the byte sequence is
     reached.

     WS
          websocket stream for decoding.

     STREAMBUF
          byte sequence for decoding.  This is what you typically
          received via ‘recv()’.

     STREAMBUF_LEN
          length of the byte sequence in parameter ‘streambuf’.

     STREAMBUF_READ_LEN
          pointer to a variable, which receives the number of bytes,
          that has been processed by this call.  This value may be less
          than the value of ‘streambuf_len’ when a frame is decoded
          before the end of the buffer is reached.  The remaining bytes
          of ‘buf’ must be passed to the next call of this function.

     PAYLOAD
          pointer to a variable, which receives the allocated buffer
          with the payload data of the decoded frame.  Must not be
          ‘NULL’.  If no decoded data is available or an error occurred
          ‘NULL’ is returned.  When the returned value is not ‘NULL’
          then the buffer contains always ‘payload_len’ bytes plus one
          terminating ‘NUL’ character (regardless of the frame type).

          The caller must free this buffer using ‘MHD_websocket_free()’.

          If you passed the flag
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_GENERATE_CLOSE_FRAMES_ON_ERROR’ upon
          creation of the websocket stream and a decoding error occurred
          (function return value less than 0), then this buffer contains
          a generated close frame, which must be sent via the socket to
          the recipient.

          If you passed the flag ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FLAG_WANT_FRAGMENTS’
          upon creation of the websocket stream then this payload may
          only be a part of the complete message.  Only complete UTF-8
          sequences are returned for fragmented text frames.  If
          necessary the UTF-8 sequence will be completed with the next
          text fragment.

     PAYLOAD_LEN
          pointer to a variable, which receives length of the result
          ‘payload’ buffer in bytes.  Must not be ‘NULL’.  This receives
          0 when no data is available, when the decoded payload has a
          length of zero or when an error occurred.

     Returns a value greater than zero when a frame is complete.
     Compare with ‘enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS’ to distinguish the frame
     type.  Returns 0 when the call succeeded, but no frame is
     available.  Returns a value less than zero on errors.

 -- Function: enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS MHD_websocket_split_close_reason
          (const char* payload, size_t payload_len, unsigned short*
          reason_code, const char** reason_utf8, size_t*
          reason_utf8_len)
     Splits the payload of a decoded close frame.

     PAYLOAD
          payload of the close frame.  This parameter may only be ‘NULL’
          if ‘payload_len’ is 0.

     PAYLOAD_LEN
          length of ‘payload’.

     REASON_CODE
          pointer to a variable, which receives the numeric close
          reason.  If there was no close reason, this is 0.  This value
          can be compared with ‘enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON’.  May be
          ‘NULL’.

     REASON_UTF8
          pointer to a variable, which receives the literal close
          reason.  If there was no literal close reason, this will be
          ‘NULL’.  May be ‘NULL’.

          Please note that no memory is allocated in this function.  If
          not ‘NULL’ the returned value of this parameter points to a
          position in the specified ‘payload’.

     REASON_UTF8_LEN
          pointer to a variable, which receives the length of the
          literal close reason.  If there was no literal close reason,
          this is 0.  May be ‘NULL’.

     Returns 0 on success or a value less than zero on errors.  Can be
     compared with ‘enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS’.

14.4 Websocket encode functions
===============================

 -- Function: enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS MHD_websocket_encode_text
          (struct MHD_WebSocketStream* ws, const char* payload_utf8,
          size_t payload_utf8_len, int fragmentation, char** frame,
          size_t* frame_len, int* utf8_step)
     Encodes an UTF-8 encoded text into websocket text frame

     WS
          websocket stream;

     PAYLOAD_UTF8
          text to send.  This must be UTF-8 encoded.  If you don’t want
          UTF-8 then send a binary frame with
          ‘MHD_websocket_encode_binary()’ instead.  May be be ‘NULL’ if
          ‘payload_utf8_len’ is 0, must not be ‘NULL’ otherwise.

     PAYLOAD_UTF8_LEN
          length of ‘payload_utf8’ in bytes.

     FRAGMENTATION
          A value of ‘enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_FRAGMENTATION’ to specify the
          fragmentation behavior.  Specify
          ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FRAGMENTATION_NONE’ or just 0 if you don’t want
          to use fragmentation (default).

     FRAME
          pointer to a variable, which receives a buffer with the
          encoded text frame.  Must not be ‘NULL’.  The buffer contains
          what you typically send via ‘send()’ to the recipient.  If no
          encoded data is available the variable receives ‘NULL’.

          If the variable is not ‘NULL’ then the buffer contains always
          ‘frame_len’ bytes plus one terminating ‘NUL’ character.  The
          caller must free this buffer using ‘MHD_websocket_free()’.

     FRAME_LEN
          pointer to a variable, which receives the length of the
          encoded frame in bytes.  Must not be ‘NULL’.

     UTF8_STEP
          If fragmentation is used (the parameter ‘fragmentation’ is not
          0) then is parameter is required and must not be ‘NULL’.  If
          no fragmentation is used, this parameter is optional and
          should be ‘NULL’.

          This parameter is a pointer to a variable which contains the
          last check status of the UTF-8 sequence.  It is required to
          continue a previous UTF-8 sequence check when fragmentation is
          used, because a UTF-8 sequence could be splitted upon
          fragments.

          ‘enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP’ is used for this value.  If you
          start a new fragment using ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FRAGMENTATION_NONE’
          or ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_FRAGMENTATION_FIRST’ the old value of this
          variable will be discarded and the value of this variable will
          be initialized to ‘MHD_WEBSOCKET_UTF8STEP_NORMAL’.  On all
          other fragmentation modes the previous value of the pointed
          variable will be used to continue the UTF-8 sequence check.

     Returns 0 on success or a value less than zero on errors.  Can be
     compared with ‘enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS’.

 -- Function: enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS MHD_websocket_encode_binary
          (struct MHD_WebSocketStream* ws, const char* payload, size_t

          to use fragmentation (default).

     FRAME
          pointer to a variable, which receives a buffer with the
          encoded binary frame.  Must not be ‘NULL’.  The buffer
          contains what you typically send via ‘send()’ to the
          recipient.  If no encoded data is available the variable
          receives ‘NULL’.

          If the variable is not ‘NULL’ then the buffer contains always
          ‘frame_len’ bytes plus one terminating ‘NUL’ character.  The
          caller must free this buffer using ‘MHD_websocket_free()’.

     Encodes a websocket close frame.  Close frames are used to close a
     websocket connection in a formal way.

     WS
          websocket stream;

     REASON_CODE
          reason for close.  You can use ‘enum

          encoded frame in bytes.  Must not be ‘NULL’.

     Returns 0 on success or a value less than zero on errors.  Can be
     compared with ‘enum MHD_WEBSOCKET_STATUS’.

14.5 Websocket memory functions
===============================

 -- Function: void* MHD_websocket_malloc (struct MHD_WebSocketStream*
          ws, size_t buf_len)
     Allocates memory with the associated ‘malloc()’ function of the
     websocket stream.  The memory allocation function could be
     different for a websocket stream if ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2()’
     has been used for initialization.

     WS
          websocket stream;

     BUF_LEN
          size of the buffer to allocate in bytes.

     Returns the pointer of the allocated buffer or ‘NULL’ on failure.

 -- Function: void* MHD_websocket_realloc (struct MHD_WebSocketStream*
          ws, void* buf, size_t new_buf_len)
     Reallocates memory with the associated ‘realloc()’ function of the
     websocket stream.  The memory reallocation function could be
     different for a websocket stream if ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2()’
     has been used for initialization.

     WS
          websocket stream;

     BUF
          current buffer, may be ‘NULL’;

     NEW_BUF_LEN
          new size of the buffer in bytes.

     Return the pointer of the reallocated buffer or ‘NULL’ on failure.
     On failure the old pointer remains valid.

 -- Function: void MHD_websocket_free (struct MHD_WebSocketStream* ws,
          void* buf)
     Frees memory with the associated ‘free()’ function of the websocket
     stream.  The memory free function could be different for a
     websocket stream if ‘MHD_websocket_stream_init2()’ has been used
     for initialization.

     WS
          websocket stream;

     BUF
          buffer to free, this may be ‘NULL’ then nothing happens.

                      Version 2.1, February 1999

     Copyright © 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

     [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the
     version number 2.1.]

Preamble
--------

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software—to
make sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software—typically libraries—of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too,
but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or
the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any
particular case, based on the explanations below.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there
is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified
by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they
have is not the original version, so that the original author’s
reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by
others.

   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any
patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent
with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is
quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this
license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries
into non-free programs.

   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire
combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public
License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the
library.

   We call this license the “Lesser” General Public License because it
does _Less_ to protect the user’s freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of
an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are
the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library
does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case,
there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software
only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system,
as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users’ freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked
with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program
using a modified version of the Library.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
“work based on the library” and a “work that uses the library”.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
     program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
     other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms
     of this Lesser General Public License (also called “this License”).
     Each licensee is addressed as “you”.

     A “library” means a collection of software functions and/or data
     prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
     (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

     The “Library”, below, refers to any such software library or work
     which has been distributed under these terms.  A “work based on the
     Library” means either the Library or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter,
     translation is included without limitation in the term
     “modification”.)

     “Source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code
     means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
     control compilation and installation of the library.

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and
     output from such a program is covered only if its contents
     constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of
     the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true
     depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the
     Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library’s
     complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
     that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
     intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
     absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
     along with the Library.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of
     it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. The modified work must itself be a software library.

       b. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       c. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
          charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       d. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or
          a table of data to be supplied by an application program that
          uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
          facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to
          ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such
          function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
          whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

          (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
          has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
          application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
          application-supplied function or table used by this function
          must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
          square root function must still compute square roots.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply
     to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But
     when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
     work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on
     the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
     extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
     regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Library.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a
     volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
     work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To
     do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,
     so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License,
     version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than
     version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared,
     then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not
     make any other change in these notices.

     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
     that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to
     all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
     Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
     of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
     terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with
     the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must
     be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
     medium customarily used for software interchange.

     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
     the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
     distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled
     or linked with it, is called a “work that uses the Library”.  Such
     a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
     therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

     However, linking a “work that uses the Library” with the Library
     creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because
     it contains portions of the Library), rather than a “work that uses
     the library”.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
     Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

     When a “work that uses the Library” uses material from a header
     file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may
     be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
     not.  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work
     can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
     library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
     defined by law.

     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
     file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a
     derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus
     portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section
     6.  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
     whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link
     a “work that uses the Library” with the Library to produce a work
     containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under
     terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification
     of the work for the customer’s own use and reverse engineering for
     debugging such modifications.

     You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
     by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the
     work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include
     the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a
     reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also,
     you must do one of these things:

       a. Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
          machine-readable source code for the Library including
          whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
          distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is
          an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
          machine-readable “work that uses the Library”, as object code
          and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library
          and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
          the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who
          changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
          not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use
          the modified definitions.)

       b. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run
          time a copy of the library already present on the user’s
          computer system, rather than copying library functions into
          the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
          version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as
          the modified version is interface-compatible with the version
          that the work was made with.

       c. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
          three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
          Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
          performing this distribution.

       d. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
          from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the
          above specified materials from the same place.

       e. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
          materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

     For an executable, the required form of the “work that uses the
     Library” must include any data and utility programs needed for
     reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special
     exception, the materials to be distributed need not include
     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
     the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
     component itself accompanies the executable.

     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
     restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
     accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you
     cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that
     you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
     Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
     library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such
     a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the
     work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
     otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
          based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
          facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
          Sections above.

       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
          that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
          where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same
          work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
     Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
     distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
     your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received
     copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
     licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
     compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
     based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License
     to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the
     Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose
     any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties with this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive
     copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
     could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
     from distribution of the Library.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
     but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to
     it and “any later version”, you have the option of following the
     terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not
     specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever
     published by the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
     write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
     copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
     Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
     decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
     status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
     sharing and reuse of software generally.

                              NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
     AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
     OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
     LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
     FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
     PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE
     DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
     OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
---------------------------

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
----------------------------------------------

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
the ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is
found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE LIBRARY'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
     under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Lesser General Public License for more details.

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright © 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software—to
make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation’s software and
to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors’ reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
===============================================================

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The “Program”,
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a “work based on the
     Program” means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term “modification”.)  Each
     licensee is addressed as “you”.

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source
     code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
     it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
          any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to
          all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply
     to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But
     when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
     work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
     the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
     extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
     regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
     volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
     work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source
     or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
     on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
     that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
     so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License
     to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
     to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted
     herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
     parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
     copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
     could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
     from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to
     it and “any later version”, you have the option of following the
     terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not
     specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by
     the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                              NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
     AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
     OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
     LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
     FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
     PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
     DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
     OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=======================================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
“copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than ‘show w’ and ‘show
c’; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items—whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
