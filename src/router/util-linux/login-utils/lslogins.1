.SH "NAME"
lslogins \- display information about known users in the system
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBlslogins\fP [options] [\fB\-s\fP|\fB\-u\fP[=\fIUID\fP]] [\fB\-g\fP \fIgroups\fP] [\fB\-l\fP \fIlogins\fP] [\fIusername\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Examine the wtmp and btmp logs, \fI/etc/shadow\fP (if necessary) and \fI/passwd\fP and output the desired data.
.sp
The optional argument \fIusername\fP forces \fBlslogins\fP to print all available details about the specified user only. In this case the output format is different than in case of \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-g\fP and unknown is \fIusername\fP reported as an error.
.sp
The default action is to list info about all the users in the system.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.sp
\fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-acc\-expiration\fP
.RS 4
Display data about the date of last password change and the account expiration date (see \fBshadow\fP(5) for more info). (Requires root privileges.)
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-btmp\-file\fP \fIpath\fP
.RS 4
Alternate path for btmp.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-colon\-separate\fP
.RS 4
Separate info about each user with a colon instead of a newline.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-\-export\fP
.RS 4
Output data in the format of NAME=VALUE. See also option \fB\-\-shell\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-failed\fP
.RS 4
Display data about the users\*(Aq last failed login attempts.

.sp

.RE
.sp
\fB\-g\fP, \fB\-\-groups\fP=\fIgroups\fP
.RS 4
Only show data of users belonging to \fIgroups\fP. More than one group may be specified; the list has to be comma\-separated. Unknown group names are ignored.
.sp
Note that the relation between user and group may be invisible for the primary group if the user is not explicitly specified as group member (e.g., in \fI/etc/group\fP). If the command \fBlslogins\fP scans for groups then it uses the groups database only, and the user database with primary GID is not used at all.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-L\fP, \fB\-\-last\fP
.RS 4
Display data containing information about the users\*(Aq last login sessions.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-logins\fP=\fIlogins\fP

.RS 4
Show system accounts. These are by default all accounts with a UID between 101 and 999 (inclusive), with the exception of either nobody or nfsnobody (UID 65534). This hardcoded default may be overwritten by parameters \fBSYS_UID_MIN\fP and \fBSYS_UID_MAX\fP in the file \fI/etc/login.defs\fP.

.RS 4
Alternate path for \fBlastlog\fP(8).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-y\fP, \fB\-\-shell\fP
.RS 4
The column name will be modified to contain only characters allowed for shell variable identifiers. This is usable, for example, with \fB\-\-export\fP. Note that this feature has been automatically enabled for \fB\-\-export\fP in version 2.37, but due to compatibility issues, now it\(cqs necessary to request this behavior by \fB\-\-shell\fP.

.sp
Multiple fields describe password status.
.sp
\fB"Password is locked"\fP
.RS 4
The password is prefixed by \*(Aq!!\*(Aq, and the user cannot login although the password is set or empty. This is common for new accounts without a set password.
.RE
.sp
\fB"Password not required (empty)"\fP
.RS 4
The password is not set (hash is missing); this is common for locked system accounts. Not requiring a password does not mean the user can log\-in without a password. It depends on the password "lock" status.
.RE
.sp
\fB"Login by password disabled"\fP
.RS 4
\*(Aqyes\*(Aq means that there is no valid password. The password hash is missing, or the hash method is unknown or contains invalid chars.
