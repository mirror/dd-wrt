.SH "NAME"
mesg \- display (or do not display) messages from other users
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBmesg\fP [\fIoption\fP] [\fBn\fP|\fBy\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBmesg\fP utility is invoked by a user to control write access others have to the terminal device associated with standard error output. If write access is allowed, then programs such as \fBtalk\fP(1) and \fBwrite\fP(1) may display messages on the terminal.
.sp
Traditionally, write access is allowed by default. However, as users become more conscious of various security risks, there is a trend to remove write access by default, at least for the primary login shell. To make sure your ttys are set the way you want them to be set, \fBmesg\fP should be executed in your login scripts.
.sp
The \fBmesg\fP utility silently exits with error status 2 if not executed on a terminal. In this case executing \fBmesg\fP is pointless. The command line option \fB\-\-verbose\fP forces \fBmesg\fP to print a warning in this situation. This behaviour has been introduced in version 2.33.
