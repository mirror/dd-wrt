.SH "NAME"
scriptlive \- re\-run session typescripts, using timing information
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBscriptlive\fP [options] [\fB\-t\fP] \fItimingfile\fP [\fB\-I\fP|\fB\-B\fP] \fItypescript\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This program re\-runs a typescript, using stdin typescript and timing information to ensure that input happens in the same rhythm as it originally appeared when the script was recorded.
.sp
The \fBsession is executed\fP in a newly created pseudoterminal with the user\(cqs $SHELL (or defaults to \fI/bin/bash\fP).
.sp
\fBBe careful!\fP Do not forget that the typescript may contains arbitrary commands. It is recommended to use \fB"scriptreplay \-\-stream in \-\-log\-in typescript"\fP (or with \fB\-\-log\-io\fP instead of \fB\-\-log\-in\fP) to verify the typescript before it is executed by \fBscriptlive\fP.
.sp
The timing information is what \fBscript\fP(1) outputs to file specified by \fB\-\-log\-timing\fP. The typescript has to contain stdin information and it is what script1 outputs to file specified by \fB\-\-log\-in\fP or \fB\-\-log\-io\fP.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-I\fP, \fB\-\-log\-in\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
File containing \fBscript\fP\(aqs terminal input.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-B\fP, \fB\-\-log\-io\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
File containing \fBscript\fP\(aqs terminal output and input.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-timing\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
File containing \fBscript\fP\(aqs timing output. This option overrides old\-style arguments.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-T\fP, \fB\-\-log\-timing\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
Aliased to \fB\-t\fP, maintained for compatibility with \fBscript\fP(1) command\-line options.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-divisor\fP \fInumber\fP
.RS 4
Speed up the replay displaying this \fInumber\fP of times. The argument is a floating\-point number. It\(cqs called divisor because it divides the timings by this factor. This option overrides old\-style arguments.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-m\fP, \fB\-\-maxdelay\fP \fInumber\fP
.RS 4
Set the maximum delay between updates to \fInumber\fP of seconds. The argument is a floating\-point number. This can be used to avoid long pauses in the typescript replay.
.RE
