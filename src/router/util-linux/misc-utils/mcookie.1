mcookie \- generate magic cookies for xauth
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBmcookie\fP [options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBmcookie\fP generates a 128\-bit random hexadecimal number for use with the X authority system. Typical usage:

.sp
The "random" number generated is actually the MD5 message digest of random information coming from one of the sources \fBgetrandom\fP(2) system call, \fI/dev/urandom\fP, \fI/dev/random\fP, or the \fIlibc pseudo\-random functions\fP, in this preference order. See also the option \fB\-\-file\fP.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-file\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
Use this \fIfile\fP as an additional source of randomness (for example \fI/dev/urandom\fP). When \fIfile\fP is \*(Aq\-\*(Aq, characters are read from standard input.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-m\fP, \fB\-\-max\-size\fP \fInumber\fP
.RS 4
Read from \fIfile\fP only this \fInumber\fP of bytes. This option is meant to be used when reading additional randomness from a file or device.
.sp
The \fInumber\fP argument may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB=1024, MiB=1024*1024, and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes KB=1000, MB=1000*1000, and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
.RS 4
Inform where randomness originated, with amount of entropy read from each source.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Display help text and exit.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
.RS 4
Print version and exit.
