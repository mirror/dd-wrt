.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBlook\fP [options] \fIstring\fP [\fIfile\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBlook\fP utility displays any lines in \fIfile\fP which contain \fIstring\fP as a prefix. As \fBlook\fP performs a binary search, the lines in \fIfile\fP must be sorted (where \fBsort\fP(1) was given the same options \fB\-d\fP and/or \fB\-f\fP that \fBlook\fP is invoked with).
.sp
If \fIfile\fP is not specified, the file \fI/usr/share/dict/words\fP is used, only alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of alphabetic characters is ignored.
