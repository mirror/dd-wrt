.SH "NAME"
col \- filter reverse line feeds from input
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBcol\fP \fIoptions\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBcol\fP filters out reverse (and half\-reverse) line feeds so the output is in the correct order, with only forward and half\-forward line feeds. It also replaces any whitespace characters with tabs where possible. This can be useful in processing the output of \fBnroff\fP(1) and \fBtbl\fP(1).
.sp
\fBcol\fP reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-no\-backspaces\fP
.RS 4
Do not output any backspaces, printing only the last character written to each column position.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-fine\fP
.RS 4
Permit half\-forward line feeds. Normally characters destined for a half\-line boundary are printed on the following line.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-tabs\fP
.RS 4
Output tabs instead of multiple spaces.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-lines\fP \fInumber\fP
.RS 4
Buffer at least \fInumber\fP lines in memory. By default, 128 lines are buffered.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-pass\fP
.RS 4
Force unknown control sequences to be passed through unchanged. Normally \fBcol\fP will filter out any control sequences other than those recognized and interpreted by itself, which are listed below.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-x\fP, \fB\-\-spaces\fP
.RS 4
Output multiple spaces instead of tabs.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Display help text and exit.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
.RS 4
Print version and exit.
.RE
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
.sp
The \fBcol\fP utility conforms to the Single UNIX Specification, Version 2. The \fB\-l\fP option is an extension to the standard.
.SH "NOTES"
.sp
The control sequences for carriage motion that \fBcol\fP understands and their decimal values are listed in the following table:
.sp
\fBESC\-7\fP
.RS 4
reverse line feed (escape then 7)
.RE
.sp
\fBESC\-8\fP
.RS 4
half reverse line feed (escape then 8)
.RE
.sp
\fBESC\-9\fP
.RS 4
half forward line feed (escape then 9)
.RE
.sp
\fBbackspace\fP
.RS 4
moves back one column (8); ignored in the first column
.RE
.sp
\fBnewline\fP
.RS 4
forward line feed (10); also does carriage return
.RE
.sp
\fBcarriage return\fP
.RS 4
(13)
.RE
.sp
\fBshift in\fP
.RS 4
shift to normal character set (15)
.RE
.sp
\fBshift out\fP
.RS 4
shift to alternate character set (14)
.RE
.sp
\fBspace\fP
.RS 4
moves forward one column (32)
.RE
.sp
\fBtab\fP
.RS 4
moves forward to next tab stop (9)
.RE
.sp
\fBvertical tab\fP
.RS 4
reverse line feed (11)
.RE
.sp
All unrecognized control characters and escape sequences are discarded.
.sp
\fBcol\fP keeps track of the character set as characters are read and makes sure the character set is correct when they are output.
.sp
If the input attempts to back up to the last flushed line, \fBcol\fP will display a warning message.
.SH "HISTORY"
.sp
A \fBcol\fP command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
