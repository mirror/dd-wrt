.SH "NAME"
fsck.minix \- check consistency of Minix filesystem
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBfsck.minix\fP [options] \fIdevice\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBfsck.minix\fP performs a consistency check for the Linux MINIX filesystem.
.sp
The program assumes the filesystem is quiescent. \fBfsck.minix\fP should not be used on a mounted device unless you can be sure nobody is writing to it. Remember that the kernel can write to device when it searches for files.
.sp
The \fIdevice\fP name will usually have the following form:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.TS
allbox tab(:);
lt lt.

If the filesystem was changed, i.e., repaired, then \fBfsck.minix\fP will print "FILE SYSTEM HAS BEEN CHANGED" and will \fBsync\fP(2) three times before exiting. There is \fIno\fP need to reboot after check.
.SH "WARNING"
.sp
\fBfsck.minix\fP should \fBnot\fP be used on a mounted filesystem. Using \fBfsck.minix\fP on a mounted filesystem is very dangerous, due to the possibility that deleted files are still in use, and can seriously damage a perfectly good filesystem! If you absolutely have to run \fBfsck.minix\fP on a mounted filesystem, such as the root filesystem, make sure nothing is writing to the disk, and that no files are "zombies" waiting for deletion.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-list\fP
.RS 4
List all filenames.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-r\fP, \fB\-\-repair\fP
.RS 4
Perform interactive repairs.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-auto\fP
.RS 4
Perform automatic repairs. This option implies \fB\-\-repair\fP and serves to answer all of the questions asked with the default. Note that this can be extremely dangerous in the case of extensive filesystem damage.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
.RS 4
Be verbose.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-super\fP
.RS 4
Output super\-block information.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-m\fP, \fB\-\-uncleared\fP
.RS 4
Activate MINIX\-like "mode not cleared" warnings.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-force\fP
.RS 4
Force a filesystem check even if the filesystem was marked as valid. Marking is done by the kernel when the filesystem is unmounted.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Display help text and exit.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
.RS 4
Print version and exit.

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.sp
There are numerous diagnostic messages. The ones mentioned here are the most commonly seen in normal usage.
.sp
If the device does not exist, \fBfsck.minix\fP will print "unable to read super block". If the device exists, but is not a MINIX filesystem, \fBfsck.minix\fP will print "bad magic number in super\-block".
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.sp
The exit status returned by \fBfsck.minix\fP is the sum of the following:
.sp
\fB0\fP
.RS 4
No errors
.RE
.sp
\fB3\fP
.RS 4
Filesystem errors corrected, system should be rebooted if filesystem was mounted
.RE
.sp
\fB4\fP
.RS 4
Filesystem errors left uncorrected
.RE
.sp
\fB7\fP
.RS 4
Combination of exit statuses 3 and 4
.RE
.sp
\fB8\fP
.RS 4
