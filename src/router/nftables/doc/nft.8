.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
nft is the command line tool used to set up, maintain and inspect packet filtering and classification rules in the Linux kernel, in the nftables framework\&. The Linux kernel subsystem is known as nf_tables, and \(oqnf\(cq stands for Netfilter\&.

\fBproto\-ctx\fR,
\fBsegtree\fR,
\fBall\fR\&. You can combine more than one by separating by the
\fI,\fR
symbol, for example
\fI\-d eval,mnl\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "INPUT FILE FORMATS"
.SS "LEXICAL CONVENTIONS"
.sp
Input is parsed line\-wise\&. When the last character of a line, just before the newline character, is a non\-quoted backslash (\e), the next line is treated as a continuation\&. Multiple commands on the same line can be separated using a semicolon (;)\&.
.sp
A hash sign (#) begins a comment\&. All following characters on the same line are ignored\&.
.sp
Identifiers begin with an alphabetic character (a\-z,A\-Z), followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters (a\-z,A\-Z,0\-9) and the characters slash (/), backslash (\e), underscore (_) and dot (\&.)\&. Identifiers using different characters or clashing with a keyword need to be enclosed in double quotes (")\&.
.SS "INCLUDE FILES"
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBinclude\fR \fIfilename\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Other files can be included by using the \fBinclude\fR statement\&. The directories to be searched for include files can be specified using the \fB\-I\fR/\fB\-\-includepath\fR option\&. You can override this behaviour either by prepending \(oq\&./\(cq to your path to force inclusion of files located in the current working directory (i\&.e\&. relative path) or / for file location expressed as an absolute path\&.
.sp
If \fB\-I\fR/\fB\-\-includepath\fR is not specified, then nft relies on the default directory that is specified at compile time\&. You can retrieve this default directory via the \fB\-h\fR/\fB\-\-help\fR option\&.
.sp
Include statements support the usual shell wildcard symbols (\fB,?,[])\&. Having no matches for an include statement is not an error, if wildcard symbols are used in the include statement\&. This allows having potentially empty include directories for statements like \fR\fB\fBinclude "/etc/firewall/rules/\fR\fR\fB"\fR\&. The wildcard matches are loaded in alphabetical order\&. Files beginning with dot (\&.) are not matched by include statements\&.
.SS "SYMBOLIC VARIABLES"

.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
Symbolic variables can be defined using the \fBdefine\fR statement\&. Variable references are expressions and can be used to initialize other variables\&. The scope of a definition is the current block and all blocks contained within\&. Symbolic variables can be undefined using the \fBundefine\fR statement, and modified using the \fBredefine\fR statement\&.

Tunneled packets (such as \fBvxlan\fR) are processed by netdev family hooks both in decapsulated and encapsulated (tunneled) form\&. So a packet can be filtered on the overlay network as well as on the underlying network\&.
.sp
Note that the order of netfilter and \fBtc\fR is mirrored on ingress versus egress\&. This ensures symmetry for NAT and other packet mangling\&.
.sp
Ingress packets which are redirected out some other interface are only processed by netfilter on egress if they have passed through netfilter ingress processing before\&. Thus, ingress packets which are redirected by \fBtc\fR are not subjected to netfilter\&. But they are if they are redirected by \fBnetfilter\fR on ingress\&. Conceptually, tc and netfilter can be thought of as layers, with netfilter layered above tc: If the packet hasn\(cqt been passed up from the tc layer to the netfilter layer, it\(cqs not subjected to netfilter on egress\&.

Tables are containers for chains, sets and stateful objects\&. They are identified by their address family and their name\&. The address family must be one of \fBip\fR, \fBip6\fR, \fBinet\fR, \fBarp\fR, \fBbridge\fR, \fBnetdev\fR\&. The \fBinet\fR address family is a dummy family which is used to create hybrid IPv4/IPv6 tables\&. The \fBmeta expression nfproto\fR keyword can be used to test which family (ipv4 or ipv6) context the packet is being processed in\&. When no address family is specified, \fBip\fR is used by default\&. The only difference between add and create is that the former will not return an error if the specified table already exists while \fBcreate\fR will return an error\&.

The inet family also supports the
\fBingress\fR
hook (since Linux kernel 5\&.10), to filter IPv4 and IPv6 packet at the same location as the netdev

\fBingress\fR

The \fBdevice\fR parameter accepts a network interface name as a string, and is required when adding a base chain that filters traffic on the ingress or egress hooks\&. Any ingress or egress chains will only filter traffic from the interface specified in the \fBdevice\fR parameter\&.
.sp
The \fBpriority\fR parameter accepts a signed integer value or a standard priority name which specifies the order in which chains with the same \fBhook\fR value are traversed\&. The ordering is ascending, i\&.e\&. lower priority values have precedence over higher ones\&.

With \fBnat\fR type chains, there\(cqs a lower excluding limit of \-200 for \fBpriority\fR values, because conntrack hooks at this priority and NAT requires it\&.
.sp
Standard priority values can be replaced with easily memorizable names\&. Not all names make sense in every family with every hook (see the compatibility matrices below) but their numerical value can still be used for prioritizing chains\&.
.sp
These names and values are defined and made available based on what priorities are used by xtables when registering their default chains\&.
.sp
Most of the families use the same values, but bridge uses different ones from the others\&. See the following tables that describe the values and compatibility\&.

Basic arithmetic expressions (addition and subtraction) can also be achieved with these standard names to ease relative prioritizing, e\&.g\&. \fBmangle \- 5\fR stands for \fB\-155\fR\&. Values will also be printed like this until the value is not further than 10 from the standard value\&.
.sp
Base chains also allow one to set the chain\(cqs \fBpolicy\fR, i\&.e\&. what happens to packets not explicitly accepted or refused in contained rules\&. Supported policy values are \fBaccept\fR (which is the default) or \fBdrop\fR\&.

Rules are added to chains in the given table\&. If the family is not specified, the ip family is used\&. Rules are constructed from two kinds of components according to a set of grammatical rules: expressions and statements\&.
.sp
The add and insert commands support an optional location specifier, which is either a \fIhandle\fR or the \fIindex\fR (starting at zero) of an existing rule\&. Internally, rule locations are always identified by \fIhandle\fR and the translation from \fIindex\fR happens in userspace\&. This has two potential implications in case a concurrent ruleset change happens after the translation was done: The effective rule index might change if a rule was inserted or deleted before the referred one\&. If the referred rule was deleted, the command is rejected by the kernel just as if an invalid \fIhandle\fR was given\&.
.sp
A \fIcomment\fR is a single word or a double\-quoted (") multi\-word string which can be used to make notes regarding the actual rule\&. \fBNote:\fR If you use bash for adding rules, you have to escape the quotation marks, e\&.g\&. \e"enable ssh for servers\e"\&.

nftables offers two kinds of set concepts\&. Anonymous sets are sets that have no specific name\&. The set members are enclosed in curly braces, with commas to separate elements when creating the rule the set is used in\&. Once that rule is removed, the set is removed as well\&.

The \fBgc\-interval\fR doesn\(cqt affect element timeout, but it does affect memory reclaim\&. A large set that rarely has elements that time out can use a higher (less frequent) garbage collection to save cpu time, whereas sets that see many updates with short\-lived elements will benefit from a lower interval\&. Lower intervals ensure the set stays below its maximum size\&. Internally, a timed\-out entry stays around until it is removed by the garbage collector, which also decrements the sets element count\&. This also means that it is possible to have a set that can not accept more elements, even if all elements timed out, if the \fBgc\-interval\fR is set too large\&.
.sp
The \fBsize\fR defines the upper limit of the amount of elements that the set can support\&. Mandatory for sets that are added to from the ruleset with the \fBadd\fR and \fBupdate\fR keywords\&. Providing the \fBsize\fR keyword for sets that are only added to via \fBnft add element\fR allows for a more compact (memory conserving) set implementation selection, but it is not required\&.
.sp
The optional \fBpolicy\fR keyword can be used to request a more memory\-conserving set implementation\&.
.sp
\fBauto\-merge\fR instructs the nftables frontend to merge adjacent and overlapping ranges\&. Example: When the set contains range \fB1\&.2\&.3\&.1\-1\&.2\&.3\&.4\fR, then adding element \fB1\&.2\&.3\&.2\fR has no effect\&. Adding \fB1\&.2\&.3\&.5\fR changes the existing range to cover \fB1\&.2\&.3\&.1\-1\&.2\&.3\&.5\fR\&. Without this flag, \fB1\&.2\&.3\&.2\fR can not be added and \fB1\&.2\&.3\&.5\fR is inserted as a new entry\&.

Users can specifiy the properties/features that the set/map must support\&. This allows the kernel to pick an optimal internal representation\&. If a required flag is missing, the ruleset might still work, as nftables will auto\-enable features if it can infer this from the ruleset\&. This may not work for all cases, however, so it is recommended to specify all required features in the set/map definition manually\&. Also, some features are mutually exclusive\&. For example, it is not possible for a set to support intervals and insertion from the packet path\&.

Flowtables allow you to accelerate packet forwarding in software\&. Flowtables entries are represented through a tuple that is composed of the input interface, source and destination address, source and destination port; and layer 3/4 protocols\&. Each entry also caches the destination interface and the gateway address \- to update the destination link\-layer address \- to forward packets\&. The ttl and hoplimit fields are also decremented\&. Hence, flowtables provides an alternative path that allow packets to bypass the classic forwarding path\&. Flowtables reside in the ingress \fBhook\fR that is located before the prerouting \fBhook\fR\&. You can select which flows you want to offload through the flow expression from the forward chain\&. Flowtables are identified by their address family and their name\&. The address family must be one of ip, ip6, or inet\&. The inet address family is a dummy family which is used to create hybrid IPv4/IPv6 tables\&. When no address family is specified, ip is used by default\&.
.sp
The \fBpriority\fR can be a signed integer or \fBfilter\fR which stands for 0\&. Addition and subtraction can be used to set relative priority, e\&.g\&. filter + 5 equals to 5\&.

A meta expression refers to meta data associated with a packet\&.
.sp
There are two types of meta expressions: unqualified and qualified meta expressions\&. Qualified meta expressions require the meta keyword before the meta key, unqualified meta expressions can be specified by using the meta key directly or as qualified meta expressions\&. Meta l4proto is useful to match a particular transport protocol that is part of either an IPv4 or IPv6 packet\&. It will also skip any IPv6 extension headers present in an IPv6 packet\&.
.sp
meta iif, oif, iifname and oifname are used to match the interface a packet arrived on or is about to be sent out on\&.
.sp
iif and oif are used to match on the interface index, whereas iifname and oifname are used to match on the interface name\&. This is not the same \(em assuming the rule
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
filter input meta iif "foo"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Then this rule can only be added if the interface "foo" exists\&. Also, the rule will continue to match even if the interface "foo" is renamed to "bar"\&.
.sp
This is because internally the interface index is used\&. In case of dynamically created interfaces, such as tun/tap or dialup interfaces (ppp for example), it might be better to use iifname or oifname instead\&.
.sp
In these cases, the name is used so the interface doesn\(cqt have to exist to add such a rule, it will stop matching if the interface gets renamed and it will match again in case interface gets deleted and later a new interface with the same name is created\&.
.sp
Like with iptables, wildcard matching on interface name prefixes is available for \fBiifname\fR and \fBoifname\fR matches by appending an asterisk (*) character\&. Note however that unlike iptables, nftables does not accept interface names consisting of the wildcard character only \- users are supposed to just skip those always matching expressions\&. In order to match on literal asterisk character, one may escape it using backslash (\e)\&.

A fib expression queries the fib (forwarding information base) to obtain information such as the output interface index\&.
.sp
The first arguments to the \fBfib\fR expression are the input keys to be passed to the fib lookup function\&. One of \fBsaddr\fR or \fBdaddr\fR is mandatory, they are also mutually exclusive\&.
.sp
\fBmark\fR, \fBiif\fR and \fBoif\fR keywords are optional modifiers to influence the search result, see the \fBFIB_TUPLE\fR keyword table below for a description\&. The \fBiif\fR and \fBoif\fR tuple keywords are also mutually exclusive\&.
.sp
The last argument to the \fBfib\fR expression is the desired result type\&.
.sp
\fBoif\fR asks to obtain the interface index that would be used to send packets to the packets source (\fBsaddr\fR key) or destination (\fBdaddr\fR key)\&. If no routing entry is found, the returned interface index is 0\&.
.sp
\fBoifname\fR is like \fBoif\fR, but it fills the interface name instead\&. This is useful to check dynamic interfaces such as ppp devices\&. If no entry is found, an empty interface name is returned\&.
.sp
\fBtype\fR returns the address type such as unicast or multicast\&. A complete list of supported address types can be shown with \fBnft\fR \fBdescribe\fR \fBfib_addrtype\fR\&.

# drop packets without a reverse path
filter prerouting fib saddr \&. iif oif missing drop

In this example, \*(Aqsaddr \&. iif\*(Aq looks up a route to the *source address* of the packet and restricts matching
results to the interface that the packet arrived on, then stores the output interface index from the obtained
fib route result\&.

If no route was found for the source address/input interface combination, the output interface index is zero\&.
Hence, this rule will drop all packets that do not have a strict reverse path (hypothetical reply packet
would be sent via the interface the tested packet arrived on)\&.

If only \*(Aqsaddr oif\*(Aq is used as the input key, then this rule would only drop packets where the fib cannot
find a route\&. In most setups this will never drop packets because the default route is returned\&.

# drop packets if the destination ip address is not configured on the incoming interface
filter prerouting fib daddr \&. iif type != { local, broadcast, multicast } drop

This queries the fib based on the current packets\*(Aq destination address and the incoming interface\&.

If the packet is sent to a unicast address that is configured on a different interface, then the packet
will be dropped as such an address would be classified as \*(Aqunicast\*(Aq type\&.
Without the \*(Aqiif\*(Aq modifier, any address configured on the local machine is \*(Aqlocal\*(Aq, and unicast addresses
not configured on any interface would return the type \*(Aqunicast\*(Aq\&.

# perform lookup in a specific \*(Aqblackhole\*(Aq table (0xdead, needs ip appropriate ip rule)
filter prerouting meta mark set 0xdead fib daddr \&. mark type vmap { blackhole : drop, prohibit : jump prohibited, unreachable : drop }

The vlan expression is used to match on the vlan header fields\&. This expression will not work in the \fBip\fR, \fBip6\fR and \fBinet\fR families, unless the vlan interface is configured with the \fBreorder_hdr off\fR setting\&. The default is \fBreorder_hdr on\fR which will automatically remove the vlan tag from the packet\&. See ip\-link(8) for more information\&. For these families its easier to match the vlan interface name instead, using the \fBmeta iif\fR or \fBmeta iifname\fR expression\&.

The raw payload expression instructs to load \fIlength\fR bits starting at \fIoffset\fR bits\&. Bit 0 refers to the very first bit \(em in the C programming language, this corresponds to the topmost bit, i\&.e\&. 0x80 in case of an octet\&. They are useful to match headers that do not have a human\-readable template expression yet\&. Note that nft will not add dependencies for Raw payload expressions\&. If you e\&.g\&. want to match protocol fields of a transport header with protocol number 5, you need to manually exclude packets that have a different transport header, for instance by using \fBmeta l4proto 5\fR before the raw expression\&.

it is more convenient, but like the raw expression notation no dependencies are created or checked\&.

.SS "CONNTRACK EXPRESSIONS"
.sp
Conntrack expressions refer to meta data of the connection tracking entry associated with a packet\&.
.sp
There are three types of conntrack expressions\&. Some conntrack expressions require the flow direction before the conntrack key, others must be used directly because they are direction agnostic\&. The \fBpackets\fR, \fBbytes\fR and \fBavgpkt\fR keywords can be used with or without a direction\&. If the direction is omitted, the sum of the original and the reply direction is returned\&. The same is true for the \fBzone\fR, if a direction is given, the zone is only matched if the zone id is tied to the given direction\&.

.SH "STATEMENTS"
.sp
Statements represent actions to be performed\&. They can alter control flow (return, jump to a different chain, accept or drop the packet) or can perform actions, such as logging, rejecting a packet, etc\&.
.sp
Statements exist in two kinds\&. Terminal statements unconditionally terminate evaluation of the current rule, non\-terminal statements either only conditionally or never terminate evaluation of the current rule, in other words, they are passive from the ruleset evaluation perspective\&. There can be an arbitrary amount of non\-terminal statements in a rule, but only a single terminal statement as the final statement\&.

\fBaccept\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Terminate ruleset evaluation and accept the packet\&. The packet can still be dropped later by another hook, for instance accept in the forward hook still allows one to drop the packet later in the postrouting hook, or another forward base chain that has a higher priority number and is evaluated afterwards in the processing pipeline\&.
T}
T{
.sp
\fBdrop\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Terminate ruleset evaluation and drop the packet\&. The drop occurs instantly, no further chains or hooks are evaluated\&. It is not possible to accept the packet in a later chain again, as those are not evaluated anymore for the packet\&.
T}
T{
.sp
\fBqueue\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Terminate ruleset evaluation and queue the packet to userspace\&. Userspace must provide a drop or accept verdict\&. In case of accept, processing resumes with the next base chain hook, not the rule following the queue verdict\&.

Continue ruleset evaluation with the next rule\&. This is the default behaviour in case a rule issues no verdict\&.

Return from the current chain and continue evaluation at the next rule in the last chain\&. If issued in a base chain, it is equivalent to the base chain policy\&.

\fBjump\fR \fICHAIN\fR

Continue evaluation at the first rule in \fICHAIN\fR\&. The current position in the ruleset is pushed to a call stack and evaluation will continue there when the new chain is entirely evaluated or a \fBreturn\fR verdict is issued\&. In case an absolute verdict is issued by a rule in the chain, ruleset evaluation terminates immediately and the specific action is taken\&.
T}

The log statement enables logging of matching packets\&. When this statement is used from a rule, the Linux kernel will print some information on all matching packets, such as header fields, via the kernel log (where it can be read with dmesg(1) or read in the syslog)\&.
.sp
In the second form of invocation (if \fInflog_group\fR is specified), the Linux kernel will pass the packet to nfnetlink_log which will send the log through a netlink socket to the specified group\&. One userspace process may subscribe to the group to receive the logs, see man(8) ulogd for the Netfilter userspace log daemon and libnetfilter_log documentation for details in case you would like to develop a custom program to digest your logs\&.
.sp
In the third form of invocation (if level audit is specified), the Linux kernel writes a message into the audit buffer suitably formatted for reading with auditd\&. Therefore no further formatting options (such as prefix or flags) are allowed in this mode\&.
.sp
This is a non\-terminating statement, so the rule evaluation continues after the packet is logged\&.

.sp
The ct statement sets meta data associated with a connection\&. The zone id has to be assigned before a conntrack lookup takes place, i\&.e\&. this has to be done in prerouting and possibly output (if locally generated packets need to be placed in a distinct zone), with a hook priority of \fBraw\fR (\-300)\&.
.sp
Unlike iptables, where the helper assignment happens in the raw table, the helper needs to be assigned after a conntrack entry has been found, i\&.e\&. it will not work when used with hook priorities equal or before \-200\&.

A limit statement matches at a limited rate using a token bucket filter\&. A rule using this statement will match until this limit is reached\&. It can be used in combination with the log statement to give limited logging\&. The optional \fBover\fR keyword makes it match over the specified rate\&.
.sp
The \fBburst\fR value influences the bucket size, i\&.e\&. jitter tolerance\&. With packet\-based \fBlimit\fR, the bucket holds exactly \fBburst\fR packets, by default five\&. If you specify packet \fBburst\fR, it must be a non\-zero value\&. With byte\-based \fBlimit\fR, the bucket\(cqs minimum size is the given rate\(cqs byte value and the \fBburst\fR value adds to that, by default zero bytes\&.

The nat statements are only valid from nat chain types\&.
.sp
The \fBsnat\fR and \fBmasquerade\fR statements specify that the source address/port of the packet should be modified\&. While \fBsnat\fR is only valid in the postrouting and input chains, \fBmasquerade\fR makes sense only in postrouting\&. The dnat and redirect statements are only valid in the prerouting and output chains, they specify that the destination address/port of the packet should be modified\&. You can use non\-base chains which are called from base chains of nat chain type too\&. All future packets in this connection will also be mangled, and rules should cease being examined\&.
.sp
The \fBmasquerade\fR statement is a special form of snat which always uses the outgoing interface\(cqs IP address to translate to\&. It is particularly useful on gateways with dynamic (public) IP addresses\&.
.sp
The \fBredirect\fR statement is a special form of dnat which always translates the destination address to the local host\(cqs one\&. It comes in handy to intercept traffic passing a router and feeding it to a locally running daemon, e\&.g\&. when building a transparent proxy or application\-layer gateway\&.
.sp
For \fITARGET_SPEC\fR, one may specify addresses, ports, or both\&. If no address or no port is specified, the respective packet header field remains unchanged\&.
.sp
When used in the inet family (available with kernel 5\&.2), the dnat and snat statements require the use of the ip and ip6 keyword in case an address is provided, see the examples below\&.
.sp
Before kernel 4\&.18 nat statements require both prerouting and postrouting base chains to be present since otherwise packets on the return path won\(cqt be seen by netfilter and therefore no reverse translation will take place\&.
.sp
The optional \fBprefix\fR keyword allows to map \fBn\fR source addresses to \fBn\fR destination addresses\&. See \fIAdvanced NAT examples\fR below\&.
.sp
If the \fIaddress\fR for \fBdnat\fR is an IPv4 loopback address (i\&.e\&. 127\&.0\&.0\&.0/8) the "net\&.ipv4\&.conf\&.*\&.route_localnet" sysctl for the input interface needs to be set to 1\&. Otherwise packets will be dropped by the routing code as "martians"\&.

@ipportmap maps network prefixes to a range of hosts and ports\&.
The new destination is taken from the range provided by the map element\&.
Same for the destination port\&.

Note the use of the "interval" keyword in the typeof description\&.
This is required so nftables knows that it has to ask for twice the
amount of storage for each key\-value pair in the map\&.

": ipv4_addr \&. inet_service" would allow associating one address and one port
with each key\&.  But for this case, for each key, two addresses and two ports
(The minimum and maximum values for both) have to be stored\&.

.SS "QUEUE STATEMENT"

This statement passes the packet to userspace using the nfnetlink_queue handler\&. The packet is put into the queue identified by its 16\-bit queue number\&. Userspace can inspect and modify the packet if desired\&. Userspace must then drop or re\-inject the packet into the kernel\&. See libnetfilter_queue documentation for details\&.

.SS "FWD STATEMENT"
.sp
The fwd statement is used to redirect a raw packet to another interface\&. It is only available in the netdev family ingress and egress hooks\&. It is similar to the dup statement except that no copy is made\&.
.sp
You can also specify the address of the next hop and the device to forward the packet to\&. This updates the source and destination MAC address of the packet by transmitting it through the neighboring layer\&. This also decrements the ttl field of the IP packet\&. This provides a way to effectively bypass the classical forwarding path, thus skipping the fib (forwarding information base) lookup\&.

.SS "SET STATEMENT"
.sp
The set statement is used to dynamically add or update elements in a set from the packet path\&. The set setname must already exist in the given table and must have been created with one or both of the dynamic and the timeout flags\&. The dynamic flag is required if the set statement expression includes a stateful object\&. The timeout flag is implied if the set is created with a timeout, and is required if the set statement updates elements, rather than adding them\&. Furthermore, these sets should specify both a maximum set size (to prevent memory exhaustion), and their elements should have a timeout (so their number will not grow indefinitely) either from the set definition or from the statement that adds or updates them\&. The set statement can be used to e\&.g\&. create dynamic blacklists\&.
.sp
Dynamic updates are also supported with maps\&. In this case, the \fBadd\fR or \fBupdate\fR rule needs to provide both the key and the data element (value), separated via \fI:\fR\&.

The \fBpriority\fR value dictates the order in which the hooks are called\&. The list is sorted, the lowest number is run first\&.

The priority value of hooks registered by the kernel cannot be changed\&. For basechains registered by nftables, this value corresponds to the \fBpriority\fR value specified in the base chain definition\&.

After the numerical value, information about the hook is shown\&. For basechains defined in nftables this includes the table family, the table name and the basechains name\&. For hooks coming from kernel modules, the function name is used instead\&.
.sp
If a \fBmodule name\fR is given, the hook was registered by the kernel module with this name\&. You can use \fImodinfo \fR\fI\fBmodule name\fR\fR to obtain more information about the module\&.
