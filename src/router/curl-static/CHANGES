  win32: fix a potential memory leak in Curl_load_library
  
  If a call to GetSystemDirectory fails, the `path` pointer that was
  previously allocated would be leaked. This makes sure that `path` is
  always freed.
  
  Closes #938

- include: revert 9adf3c4 and make public types void * again
  
  Many applications assume the actual contents of the public types and use
  that do for example forward declarations (saving them from including our
  public header) which then breaks when we switch from void * to a struct
  *.
  
  I'm not convinced we were wrong, but since this practise seems
  widespread enough I'm willing to (partly) step down.
  
  Now libcurl uses the struct itself when it is built and it allows
  applications to use the struct type if CURL_STRICTER is defined at the
  time of the #include.

- vtls: Only call add/getsession if session id is enabled
  
  Prior to this change we called Curl_ssl_getsessionid and
  Curl_ssl_addsessionid regardless of whether session ID reusing was
  enabled. According to comments that is in case session ID reuse was
  disabled but then later enabled.
  
  The old way was not intuitive and probably not something users expected.
  When a user disables session ID caching I'd guess they don't expect the
  session ID to be cached anyway in case the caching is later enabled.

- curl-compilers.m4: improve detection of GCC's -fvisibility= flag
  
  Some builds of GCC produce output on both stdout and stderr when --help
  --verbose is used.  The 2>&1 redirection caused them to be arbitrarily
  interleaved with each other because of stream buffering.  Consequently,
  grep failed to match the fvisibility= string in the mixed output, even
  though the string was present in GCC's standard output.
  
  This led to silently disabling symbol hiding in some builds of curl.

- tests: fix the HTTP/2 tests
  
  The HTTP/2 tests brought with commit bf05606ef1f were using the internal
  name 'http2' for the HTTP/2 server, while in fact that name was already
  used for the second instance of the HTTP server. This made tests using
  the second instance (like test 2050) fail after a HTTP/2 test had run.
  
  The server is now known as HTTP/2 internally and within the <server>
  section in test cases. 1700, 1701 and 1702 were updated accordingly.

- http2-tests: test1700 is the first real HTTP/2 test
  
  It requires that 'nghttpx' is in the PATH, and it will run the tests
  using nghttpx as a front-end proxy in front of the standard HTTP/1 test
  server. This uses HTTP/2 over plain TCP.
  
  If you like me have nghttpx installed in a custom path, you can run test 1700
  like this:
  
  $ PATH=$PATH:$HOME/build-nghttp2/bin/ ./runtests.pl 1700

  vtls: fix ssl session cache race condition
  
  Sessionid cache management is inseparable from managing individual
  session lifetimes. E.g. for reference-counted sessions (like those in
  SChannel and OpenSSL engines) every session addition and removal
  should be accompanied with refcount increment and decrement
  respectively. Failing to do so synchronously leads to a race condition
  that causes symptoms like use-after-free and memory corruption.
  This commit:
   - makes existing session cache locking explicit, thus allowing
     individual engines to manage lock's scope.
   - fixes OpenSSL and SChannel engines by putting refcount management
     inside this lock's scope in relevant places.
   - adds these explicit locking calls to other engines that use
     sessionid cache to accommodate for this change. Note, however,
     that it is unknown whether any of these engines could also have
     this race.

  http2: Add space between colon and header value
  
  curl's representation of HTTP/2 responses involves transforming the
  response to a format that is similar to HTTP/1.1. Prior to this change,
  curl would do this by separating header names and values with only a
  colon, without introducing a space after the colon.
  
  While this is technically a valid way to represent a HTTP/1.1 header
  block, it is much more common to see a space following the colon. This
  change introduces that space, to ensure that incautious tools are safely
  able to parse the header block.
  
  This also ensures that the difference between the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
  response layout is as minimal as possible.

- openssl: stricter connection check function
  
  - In the case of recv error, limit returning 'connection still in place'
  to EINPROGRESS, EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK.
  
  This is an improvement on the parent commit which changed the openssl
  connection check to use recv MSG_PEEK instead of SSL_peek.
  
  Ref: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/856baf5#comments

Daniel Stenberg (11 May 2016)
- [Anders Bakken brought this change]

  TLS: SSL_peek is not a const operation
  
  Calling SSL_peek can cause bytes to be read from the raw socket which in
  turn can upset the select machinery that determines whether there's data
  available on the socket.
  
  Since Curl_ossl_check_cxn only tries to determine whether the socket is
  alive and doesn't actually need to see the bytes SSL_peek seems like
  the wrong function to call.
  
  We're able to occasionally reproduce a connect timeout due to this
  bug. What happens is that Curl doesn't know to call SSL_connect again
  after the peek happens since data is buffered in the SSL buffer and thus
  select won't fire for this socket.
  
  Closes #795

  TLS: move the ALPN/NPN enable bits to the connection
  
  Only protocols that actually have a protocol registered for ALPN and NPN
  should try to get that negotiated in the TLS handshake. That is only
  HTTPS (well, http/1.1 and http/2) right now. Previously ALPN and NPN
  would wrongly be used in all handshakes if libcurl was built with it
  enabled.

  connect: fix invalid "Network is unreachable" errors
  
  Sometimes, in systems with both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses but where the
  network doesn't support ipv6, Curl_is_connected returns an error
  (intermittently) even if the ipv4 socket connects successfully.
  
  This happens because there's a for-loop that iterates on the sockets but
  the error variable is not resetted when the ipv4 is checked and is ok.
  
  This patch fixes this problem by setting error to 0 when checking the
  second socket and not having a result yet.

- lib: include curl_printf.h as one of the last headers
  
  curl_printf.h defines printf to curl_mprintf, etc. This can cause
  problems with external headers which may use
  __attribute__((format(printf, ...))) markers etc.
  
  To avoid that they cause problems with system includes, we include
  curl_printf.h after any system headers. That makes the three last
  headers to always be, and we keep them in this order:
  
   curl_printf.h
   curl_memory.h
   memdebug.h
  
  None of them include system headers, they all do funny #defines.
  
  Reported-by: David Benjamin
  
  Fixes #743

- memdebug.h: remove inclusion of other headers
  
  Mostly because they're not needed, because memdebug.h is always included
  last of all headers so the others already included the correct ones.
  
  But also, starting now we don't want this to accidentally include any
  system headers, as the header included _before_ this header may add
  defines and other fun stuff that we won't want used in system includes.

- [Jay Satiro brought this change]

  curl -J: make it work even without http:// scheme on URL
  
  It does open up a miniscule risk that one of the other protocols that
  libcurl could use would send back a Content-Disposition header and then
  curl would act on it even if not HTTP.
  
  A future mitigation for this risk would be to allow the callback to ask
  libcurl which protocol is being used.

  As of commit d9f3b365a3

- [Irfan Adilovic brought this change]

  configure: ac_cv_ -> curl_cv_ for write-only vars
  
  These configure vars are modified in a curl-specific way but never
  evaluated or loaded from cache, even though they are designated as
  _cv_. We could either implement proper AC_CACHE_CHECKs for them, or
  remove them completely.
  
  Fixes #603 as ac_cv_func_gethostbyname is no longer clobbered, and
  AC_CHECK_FUNC(gethostbyname...) will no longer spuriously succeed after
  the first configure run with caching.
  
  `ac_cv_func_strcasecmp` is curious, see #770.
  
  `eval "ac_cv_func_$func=yes"` can still cause problems as it works in
  tandem with AC_CHECK_FUNCS and then potentially modifies its result. It
  would be best to rewrite this test to use a new CURL_CHECK_FUNCS macro,
  which works the same as AC_CHECK_FUNCS but relies on caching the values
  of curl_cv_func_* variables, without modifiying ac_cv_func_*.

  configure: ac_cv_ -> curl_cv_ for r/w vars

  configure: ac_cv_func_clock_gettime -> curl_...
  
  This variable must not be cached in its current form, as any cached

  just `curl_`.

- [Irfan Adilovic brought this change]

  configure: ac_cv_ -> curl_cv_ for all cached vars

  sendf.c: added ability to call recv() before send() as workaround

  request. This behavior noticeable on HTTP server short replies if
  libcurl use several send() for request (usually for POST request).
  To workaround this problem, libcurl use recv() before every send() and
  keeps received data in intermediate buffer for further processing.

  http2: Ensure that http2_handle_stream_close is called
  
  This commit ensures that streams which was closed in on_stream_close
  callback gets passed to http2_handle_stream_close.  Previously, this
  might not happen.  To achieve this, we increment drain property to
  forcibly call recv function for that stream.
  
  To more accurately check that we have no pending event before shutting
  down HTTP/2 session, we sum up drain property into
  http_conn.drain_total.  We only shutdown session if that value is 0.
  
  With this commit, when stream was closed before reading response
  header fields, error code CURLE_HTTP2_STREAM is returned even if
  HTTP/2 level error is NO_ERROR.  This signals the upper layer that
  stream was closed by error just like TCP connection close in HTTP/1.

  http2: Process paused data first before tear down http2 session
  
  This commit ensures that data from network are processed before HTTP/2
  session is terminated.  This is achieved by pausing nghttp2 whenever
  different stream than current easy handle receives data.
  
  This commit also fixes the bug that sometimes processing hangs when
  multiple HTTP/2 streams are multiplexed.

  http2: Add handling stream level error
  
  Previously, when a stream was closed with other than NGHTTP2_NO_ERROR
  by RST_STREAM, underlying TCP connection was dropped.  This is
  undesirable since there may be other streams multiplexed and they are
  very much fine.  This change introduce new error code
  CURLE_HTTP2_STREAM, which indicates stream error that only affects the
  relevant stream, and connection should be kept open.  The existing
  CURLE_HTTP2 means connection error in general.

- krb5: Only generate a SPN when its not known
  
  Prior to this change, we were generating the SPN in the SSPI code when
  the credentials were NULL and in the GSS-API code when the context was
  empty. It is better to decouple the SPN generation from these checks
  and only generate it when the SPN itself is NULL.

- curl/mprintf.h: remove support for _MPRINTF_REPLACE
  
  The define is not in our name space and is therefore not protected by

  It was only really used by libcurl internals but was mostly erased from
  there already in 8aabbf5 (March 2015). This is supposedly the final
  death blow to that define from everywhere.
  
  As a side-effect, making sure _MPRINTF_REPLACE is gone and not used, I
  made the lib tests in tests/libtest/ use curl_printf.h for its redefine
  magic and then subsequently the use of sprintf() got banned in the tests
  as well (as it is in libcurl internals) and I then replaced them all
  with snprintf().
  
  In the unlikely event that any users is actually using this define and
  gets sad by this change, it is very easily copied to the user's own
  code.

- http_ntlm: Renamed from curl_ntlm.[c|h]
  
  Renamed the header and source files for this module as they are HTTP
  specific and as such, they should use the naming convention as other
  HTTP authentication source files do - this revert commit 260ee6b7bf.
  
  Note: We could also rename curl_ntlm_wb.[c|h], however, the Winbind
  code needs separating from the HTTP protocol and migrating into the
  vauth directory, thus adding support for Winbind to the SASL based
  protocols such as IMAP, POP3 and SMTP.

  that it failed to process, however that offset is not a byte offset and
  may not even be in the locale encoding therefore we can't use it to show
  the user the character that failed to process.

- build-wolfssl: Update VS properties for wolfSSL v3.9.0
  
  - Do not use wolfSSL's sample user-setting files.
  
  wolfSSL starting in v3.9.0 has added their own sample user settings that
  are applied by default, but we don't use them because we have our own
  settings.
  
  - Do not use wolfSSL's Visual Studio Unicode character setting.
  
  wolfSSL Visual Studio projects use the Unicode character set however our
  settings and options imitate mingw build which does not use the Unicode
  character set. This does not appear to have any effect at the moment but
  better safe than sorry.
  
  
  These changes are backwards compatible with earlier versions.

Steve Holme (19 Mar 2016)
- build: Added missing Visual Studio filter files for VC10 onwards
  
  As these files don't need to contain references to the source files,
  although typically do, added basic files which only include three
  filters and don't require the project file generator to be modified.
  
  These files allow the source code to be viewed in the Solution Explorer
  in versions of Visual Studio from 2010 onwards in the same manner as
  previous versions did rather than one large view of files.

- ftp/imap/pop3/smtp: Fixed compilation warning when /Wall enabled

- imap.c: Fixed compilation warning with /Wall enabled
  
  warning C4701: potentially uninitialized local variable 'size' used
  
  Technically this can't happen, as the usage of 'size' is protected by
  'if(parsed)' and 'parsed' is only set after 'size' has been parsed.
  
  Anyway, lets keep the compiler happy.

- KNOWN_BUGS: #93 Issue with CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN in arrays on 32-bit platforms

Daniel Stenberg (18 Mar 2016)
- bump: the coming release is 7.48.0

- configure: use cpp -P when needed
  
  Since gcc 5, the processor output can get split up on multiple lines
  that made the configure script fail to figure out values from
  definitions. The fix is to use cpp -P, and this fix now first checks if
  cpp -P is necessary and then if cpp -P works before it uses that to
  extract defined values.
  
  Fixes #719

Steve Holme (18 Mar 2016)
- formdata.c: Fixed compilation warning
  
  formdata.c:390: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
  
  Introduced in commit ca5f9341ef this happens because a char*, which is
  32-bits wide in 32-bit land, is being cast to a curl_off_t which is
  64-bits wide where 64-bit integers are supported by the compiler.
  
  This doesn't happen in 64-bit land as a pointer is the same size as a
  curl_off_t.
  
  This fix doesn't address the fact that a 64-bit value cannot be used
  for CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN when set in a form array and compiled on a
  32-bit platforms, it does at least suppress the compilation warning.

  Since sh_getentry() now checks for invalid sockets itself and by

  Simplify the code by using a single entry that looks for a socket in the
  socket hash. As indicated in #712, the code looked for CURL_SOCKET_BAD

  avoid that.

  ... as it implies we need to check for that on all the other variable
  references as well (as Coverity otherwise warns us for missing NULL
  checks), and we're alredy making sure that the pointer is never NULL.

- cookies: first n/v pair in Set-Cookie: is the cookie, then parameters
  
  RFC 6265 section 4.1.1 spells out that the first name/value pair in the
  header is the actual cookie name and content, while the following are
  the parameters.
  
  libcurl previously had a more liberal approach which causes significant
  problems when introducing new cookie parameters, like the suggested new
  cookie priority draft.
  
  The previous logic read all n/v pairs from left-to-right and the first
  name used that wassn't a known parameter name would be used as the
  cookie name, thus accepting "Set-Cookie: Max-Age=2; person=daniel" to be
  a cookie named 'person' while an RFC 6265 compliant parser should
  consider that to be a cookie named 'Max-Age' with an (unknown) parameter
  'person'.
  
  Fixes #709

- krb5: improved type handling to avoid clang compiler warnings

- url.c: fix clang warning: no newline at end of file

- curl_multi_wait: never return -1 in 'numfds'
  
  Such a return value isn't documented but could still happen, and the
  curl tool code checks for it. It would happen when the underlying
  Curl_poll() function returns an error. Starting now we mask that error
  as a user of curl_multi_wait() would have no way to handle it anyway.

- multi_remove_handle: keep the timeout list until after disconnect
  
  The internal Curl_done() function uses Curl_expire() at times and that
  uses the timeout list. Better clean up the list once we're done using
  it. This caused a segfault.

  TFTP: add option to suppress TFTP option requests (Part 1)
  
  Some TFTP server implementations ignore the "TFTP Option extension"
  (RFC 1782-1784, 2347-2349), or implement it in a flawed way, causing
  problems with libcurl. Another switch for curl_easy_setopt
  "CURLOPT_TFTP_NO_OPTIONS" is introduced which prevents libcurl from
  sending TFTP option requests to a server, avoiding many problems caused
  by faulty implementations.

  openssl: remove most BoringSSL #ifdefs.
  
  As of https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/#/c/6980/, almost all of
  BoringSSL #ifdefs in cURL should be unnecessary:
  
  - BoringSSL provides no-op stubs for compatibility which replaces most
    #ifdefs.
  
  - DES_set_odd_parity has been in BoringSSL for nearly a year now. Remove
    the compatibility codepath.
  
  - With a small tweak to an extend_key_56_to_64 call, the NTLM code
    builds fine.
  
  - Switch OCSP-related #ifdefs to the more generally useful
    OPENSSL_NO_OCSP.
  
  The only #ifdefs which remain are Curl_ossl_version and the #undefs to
  work around OpenSSL and wincrypt.h name conflicts. (BoringSSL leaves
  that to the consumer. The in-header workaround makes things sensitive to
  include order.)
  
  This change errs on the side of removing conditionals despite many of
  the restored codepaths being no-ops. (BoringSSL generally adds no-op
  compatibility stubs when possible. OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER #ifdefs are
  bad enough!)

- mbedtls: Fix pinned key return value on fail
  
  - Switch from verifying a pinned public key in a callback during the
  certificate verification to inline after the certificate verification.
  
  The callback method had three problems:
  
  1. If a pinned public key didn't match, CURLE_SSL_PINNEDPUBKEYNOTMATCH
  was not returned.
  
  2. If peer certificate verification was disabled the pinned key
  verification did not take place as it should.
  
  3. (related to #2) If there was no certificate of depth 0 the callback
  would not have checked the pinned public key.
  
  Though all those problems could have been fixed it would have made the
  code more complex. Instead we now verify inline after the certificate
  verification in mbedtls_connect_step2.

- configure: assume IPv6 works when cross-compiled
  
  The configure test uses AC_TRY_RUN to figure out if an ipv6 socket

  IPv6 support is widespread so a blind guess is probably more likely to
  be 'yes' than 'no' now.
  
  Further: anyone who cross-compiles can use configure's --disable-ipv6 to
  explicitly disable IPv6 and that also works for cross-compiles.

  http2: Ensure that http2_handle_stream_close is called
  
  Previously, when HTTP/2 is enabled and used, and stream has content
  length known, Curl_read was not called when there was no bytes left to
  read. Because of this, we could not make sure that
  http2_handle_stream_close was called for every stream. Since we use
  http2_handle_stream_close to emit trailer fields, they were
  effectively ignored. This commit changes the code so that Curl_read is

  http2: Support trailer fields
  
  This commit adds trailer support in HTTP/2.  In HTTP/1.1, chunked
  encoding must be used to send trialer fields.  HTTP/2 deprecated any
  trandfer-encoding, including chunked.  But trailer fields are now
  always available.
  
  Since trailer fields are relatively rare these days (gRPC uses them
  extensively though), allocating buffer for trailer fields is done when
  we detect that HEADERS frame containing trailer fields is started.  We
  use Curl_add_buffer_* functions to buffer all trailers, just like we
  do for regular header fields.  And then deliver them when stream is
  closed.  We have to be careful here so that all data are delivered to
  upper layer before sending trailers to the application.
  
  We can deliver trailer field one by one using NGHTTP2_ERR_PAUSE
  mechanism, but current method is far more simple.
  
  Another possibility is use chunked encoding internally for HTTP/2
  traffic.  I have not tested it, but it could add another overhead.

  http2: Fix hanging paused stream
  
  When NGHTTP2_ERR_PAUSE is returned from data_source_read_callback, we
  might not process DATA frame fully.  Calling nghttp2_session_mem_recv()
  again will continue to process DATA frame, but if there is no incoming
  frames, then we have to call it again with 0-length data.  Without this,
  on_stream_close callback will not be called, and stream could be hanged.

  lwip: Fix compatibility issues with later versions
  
  The name of the header guard in lwIP's <lwip/opt.h> has changed from
  '__LWIP_OPT_H__' to 'LWIP_HDR_OPT_H' (bug #35874 in May 2015).
  
  Other fixes:
  
  - In curl_setup.h, the problem with an old PSDK doesn't apply if lwIP is
  used.
  
  - In memdebug.h, the 'socket' should be undefined first due to lwIP's
  lwip_socket() macro.
  
  - In curl_addrinfo.c lwIP's getaddrinfo() + freeaddrinfo() macros need
  special handling because they were undef'ed in memdebug.h.
  
  - In select.c we can't use preprocessor conditionals inside select if
  MSVC and select is a macro, as it is with lwIP.

  the mechanism would be chosen.

  cmake: Add missing feature macros in config header
  
  The curl_config.h file can be generated either from curl_config.h.cmake
  or curl_config.h.in, depending on whether you're building using CMake or
  the autotools.  The CMake template header doesn't include entries for
  all of the protocols that you can disable, which (I think) means that
  you can't actually disable those protocols when building via CMake.

  BoringSSL: Work with stricter BIO_get_mem_data()

  an explicit cast to grab the pointer as a `const char **`.

- build: Fix support for PKG_CONFIG
  
  - Allow the user to use PKG_CONFIG but not PKGCONFIG.
  
  Background:
  
  Last week in 14d5a86 a change was made to allow the user to set the
  PKGCONFIG variable. Today in 72d99f2 I supplemented that to allow the
  more common PKG_CONFIG as an alternative if PKGCONFIG is not set.
  
  Neither of those changes worked as expected because PKGCONFIG is
  occasionally reset in configure and by the CURL_CHECK_PKGCONFIG macro.
  Instead in this commit I take the approach that the user may set
  PKG_CONFIG only.

  gnutls: Support CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD
  
  The gnutls vtls back-end was previously ignoring any password set via
  CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD. Presumably this was because
  gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file did not support encrypted keys.
  
  gnutls now has a gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2 function that
  does support encrypted keys. Let's determine at compile time whether the
  available gnutls supports this new function. If it does then use it to
  pass the password. If it does not then emit a helpful diagnostic if a
  password is set. This is preferable to the previous behaviour of just
  failing to read the certificate without giving a reason in that case.
