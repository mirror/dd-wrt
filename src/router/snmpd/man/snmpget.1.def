.TH SNMPGET 1 "08 Feb 2002" VVERSIONINFO "Net-SNMP"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
snmpget - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GET requests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpget
[COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cf] OID [OID]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmpget
is an SNMP application that uses the SNMP GET request to query for
information on a network entity.  One or more object identifiers
(OIDs) may be given as arguments on the command line.  Each variable
name is given in the format specified in
.IR variables(5) .
.PP
For example:
.PP
snmpget -c public zeus system.sysDescr.0
.PP
will retrieve the variable system.sysDescr.0:
.PP
system.sysDescr.0 = "SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m"
.PP
If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
error packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to
pinpoint in what way the request was malformed.  If there were other
variables in the request, the request will be resent without the bad
variable.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 8
.B -Cf
If
.B -Cf
is
.I not
specified, some applications
.RB ( snmpdelta ", " snmpget ", " snmpgetnext " and " snmpstatus )
will try to fix errors returned by the agent that you were talking to
and resend the request.  The only time this is really useful is if you
specified a OID that didn't exist in your request and you're using
SNMPv1 which requires "all or nothing" kinds of requests. Here is an
example (note that system.sysUpTime is an incomplete OID as it needs
the .0 index appended to it):
.PP
.nf
snmpget -v1 -Cf -c public localhost system.sysUpTime system.sysContact.0
.BR
Error in packet
Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
This name doesn't exist: system.sysUpTime

snmpget -v1 -c public localhost system.sysUpTime system.sysContact.0
Error in packet
Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
This name doesn't exist: system.sysUpTime

system.sysContact.0 = STRING: root@localhost
.fi
.IP "" 8
With the
.B
-Cf
specified the application will not try to fix the PDU for you.
.PP
In addition to this option,
.B snmpget
takes the common options described in the 
.I snmpcmd(1)
manual page.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
snmpcmd(1), variables(5).
