DESCRIPTION
-----------

IPTraf is a console-based network monitoring program for Linux that
displays information about IP traffic.  It returns such information as:

	Current TCP connections
	UDP, ICMP, OSPF, and other types of IP packets
	Packet and byte counts on TCP connections
	IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, non-IP, and other packet and byte counts
	TCP/UDP counts by ports
	Packet counts by packet sizes
	Packet and byte counts by IP address
	Interface activity
	Flag statuses on TCP packets
	LAN station statistics
	
This program can be used to determine the type of traffic on your network,
and what kind of service is the most heavily used on what machines, among
others.

IPTraf works on Ethernet, FDDI, ISDN, PLIP, loopback, and SLIP/PPP
interfaces.

Updates and announcements are at the IPTraf Web page at

available, see README.contact for more information.

IMPORTANT CHANGES
-----------------

Important changes are detailed in the RELEASE-NOTES file, please take some
time to read it.  There are some changes in the log file names, and the
policies on multiple instances have been somewhat relaxed.

DISTRIBUTION NOTICE
-------------------

This is the general release of IPTraf.  IPTraf has been incorporated into
the Debian GNU/Linux, Turbolinux and S.u.S.E. distributions, as well as
the Trinux security toolkit distribution and Red Hat Powertools.

Linux distributions may have tailored the IPTraf package to suit their
purposes.  Direct questions, comments or inquiries about a
distribution-specific package to its maintainer.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

IPTraf 2 and later  requires at least Linux kernel 2.2.  It uses the new
PF_PACKET socket family as its capture mechanism.  This feature is new to
the 2.2 kernel.  Make sure you have the Packet Socket driver compiled in or
installed as a module, or IPTraf will fail (and so will others like it:
tcpdump, netwatch, etc).

IPTraf also requires glibc 2.1 or later.
