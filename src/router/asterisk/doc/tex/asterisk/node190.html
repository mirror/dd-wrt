Understanding When To Use /n</A>
</H2>

<P>
Lets take a look at an example that demonstrates when the use of the /n
directive is necessary. If we spawn a Local channel which does a Dial()
to a SIP channel, but we use the L() option (which is used to limit the
amount of time a call can be active, along with warning tones when the
time is nearly up), it will be associated with the Local channel,
which is then optimized out of the call path, and thus won't perform
as expected.

<P>
This following dialplan will not perform as expected.

<P>
<PRE>
[services]
exten =&gt; 2,1,Dial(SIP/PHONE\_B,,L(60000:45000:15000))

[internal]
exten =&gt; 4,1,Dial(Local/2@services)
</PRE>

<P>
By default, the Local channel will try to optimize itself out of the call path.
This means that once the Local channel has established the call between the
destination and Asterisk, the Local channel will get out of the way and let
Asterisk and the end point talk directly, instead of flowing through the Local
channel.

<P>
This can have some adverse effects when you're expecting information to be
available during the call that gets associated with the Local channel. When the
Local channel is optimized out of the call path, any Dial() flags, or channel
variables associated with the Local channel are also destroyed and are no longer
available to Asterisk.

<P>
We can force the Local channel to remain in the call path by utilizing the /n
directive. By adding /n to the end of the channel definition, we can keep the
Local channel in the call path, along with any channel variables, or other
channel specific information.

<P>
In order to make this behave as we expect (limiting the call), we would change:

<P>
<PRE>
[internal]
exten =&gt; 4,1,Dial(Local/2@services)
</PRE>

<P>
...into the following:

<P>
<PRE>
[internal]
exten =&gt; 4,1,Dial(Local/2@services/n)
</PRE>

<P>
By adding /n to the end, our Local channel will now stay in the call path and
not go away.

<P>
Why does adding the /n option all of a suddon make the 'L' option work? First
we need to show an overview of the call flow that doesn't work properly, and
discuss the information associated with the channels:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>SIP device PHONE_A calls Asterisk via a SIP INVITE
</LI>
<LI>Asterisk accepts the INVITE and then starts processing dialplan logic in the [internal] context
</LI>
<LI>Our dialplan calls Dial(Local/2@services) - notice no /n
</LI>
<LI>The Local channel then executes dialplan at extension 2 within the [services] context
</LI>
<LI>Extension 2 within [services] then performs Dial() to PHONE_B with the line:  Dial(SIP/PHONE_B,,L(60000:45000:15000))
</LI>
<LI>SIP/PHONE_B then answers the call
</LI>
<LI>Even though the L option was given when dialing the SIP device, the L information is stored in the channel that is doing the Dial() which is the Local channel, and not the endpoint SIP channel.
</LI>
<LI>The Local channel in the middle, containing the information for tracking the time allowance of the call, is then optimized out of the call path, losing all information about when to terminate the call.
</LI>
<LI>SIP/PHONE_A and SIP/PHONE_B then continue talking indefinitely.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Now, if we were to add /n to our dialplan at step three (3) then we would force the
Local channel to stay in the call path, and the L() option associated with the
Dial() from the Local channel would remain, and our warning sounds and timing
would work as expected.

<P>
There are two workarounds for the above described scenario:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Use what we just described, Dial(Local/2@services/n) to cause the Local
channel to remain in the call path so that the L() option used inside the
Local channel is not discarded when optimization is performed.
</LI>
<LI>Place the L() option at the outermost part of the path so that when the middle
is optimized out of the call path, the information required to make L() work
is associated with the outside channel. The L information will then be stored
on the calling channel, which is PHONE_A. For example:

<P>
<PRE>
[services]
exten =&gt; 2,1,Dial(SIP/PHONE_B)

[internal]
exten =&gt; 4,1,Dial(Local/2@services,,L(60000:45000:15000));
</PRE>
</LI>
</OL>
