.SH NAME
pibruin - Classification Rule Insert Utility                      

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR pibruin
.RI [ options ]
.RI [< rules ]
.RI file

.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a set of classification rules from stdin and insert them directly into a PIB file.
This program is an alternative to program \fBint6krule\fR and a companion to program \fBpibrump\fR.
Although it is possible to \fBruin\fR a PIB using this command, the name is short for "\fBru\fRle \fBin\fRsert".

.PP
Atheros recommends that users validate all classification rule sets used with this program before inserting them into an operational PIB.
Individual rules may be syntactically valid but they can still be technically invalid or conflict with other.
This program does not perform any technical or cross-rule validation what-so-ever.

.PP
Cross-rule validation is normally done by runtime firmware when a rule arrives in a VS_CLASSIFIER management message.
This validation prevents the insertion of meaningless or conflicting rules into the PIB.
It may be possible to commit a PIB containing mis-configured classification rule sets thus causing the device to lockup or misbehave on reboot.

.PP
One recommended method of rule set validation is to program a device with individual rules using program \fBint6krule\fR then read the PIB and extract the rule set with program \fBpibrump\fR.
The rule set should be valid at that point.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBAMP\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBo\fI offset\fR
Specify an alternative PIB offset when inserting the classifier block.
Customers should not use this option.
It is provided to account for firmware changes that might occur in the future.
Improper use of this option can render a PIB file unrecoverable.

.TP
.RB - q
Suppresses progress messages.

.TP
.RB - v
Print additional information on stdout.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR file
The name of a valid Atheros runtime parameter file.
The file is modified by this program only if the classification rule file is syntactically correct.
See the \fBDISCLAIMER\fR section below.
No backup file is created.
By convention, runtime parameter files have a \fB.pib\fR extention but this program does not enforce that convention.
The file must exist and be a valid PIB file or errors will occur.

.TP
.IR rules
The name of a valid classifier rule file.
The file is not modified by this program.
Classifier rule files are standard ASCII text and may be created manually using a normal text editor or may be generated automatically using another program such as \fBpubrump\fR.
By convention, classifier rule files have a .\fB.qos\fR extension but this program does not enforce that convention.
If this file is omitted then rules are read from from the console, one rule per line.

.SH DISCLAIMER
PIB file structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.
Consequently, public information is not available.
Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to change the file structure or content in future firmware releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.

.PP
This program is provided for convenience only.
It is possible to insert meaningless or confilicting rule sets into a PIB with this program because approved cross-rule validation is not performed.
Incorrect application of perfectly valid rules may render a device ineffective or unusable on a powerline network.
Program users are responsible for ensuring that their rule sets are verified by other means before using this program to insert them into an operational PIB file.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following is an example set of classification rules stored in file \fBrules.txt\fR.
The file contains 5 rules, one rule per line.
The rules are identical to command line arguments expected by program \fBint6krule\fR and one could type them, one at a time, into \fBint6krule\fR and wait for the device to reset each time.
Alternately, we could insert all the rules directly into a PIB file at once then download and commit the PIB, resulting in only one reset.

.PP
   # cat rules.txt
   Cap1 any VLANID is 20 add perm
   DropRX any VLANID is 25 add perm
   StripRx any VLANID is 5 VLANID is 10 VLANID is 15 add perm
   StripRx any VLANID is 20 add perm
   Cap1 any VLANID is 5 VLANID is 10 VLANID is 15 add perm

.PP
The following example reads file \fBrules.txt\fR from stdin and writes it into file \fBdef.pib\fR.
This may be usefule if one wanted to distribute a known set of rules to other users or wanted to test various combinations of rules.
Sincd rule files are

.PP
   # pibruin < rules.txt

.PP
The next example reads classification rules directly from file \fBabc.pib\fR using program \fBpibrump\fR and writes them directly into file \fBdef.pbi\fR using program \fBpibruin\fR.
This is one means of transfering classification rules from one PIB to another.
