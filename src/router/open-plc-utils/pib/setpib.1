.SH DESCRIPTION
Replace one or more values in a Qualcomm Atheros powerline parameter (or \fBPIB\fR) file and re-compute the checksum.
Values are specified as a sequence of type/data pairs.
Users must know the offset, length and type of the values they change or problems will certainly result.
This program makes absolutely no effort to validate offsets or values.

.PP
This program can be used to change any PIB value, including those that should not be changed.
Be warned that some PIB values are derived from, or interact with, other PIB values.
Failure to observe such dependencies may diminish performance or render a device inoperable.

.PP
Atheros does not recommend the use of this program to edit PIB parameters because small mistakes can cause big problems.
In addition, Atheros is under no obligation to provide customers with the offset, length or type of any PIB file parameters.

.PP
Atheros recommends using program \fBmodpib\fR to change device identity parameters and the Windows Device Manager to change other parameters whenever possible.

.PP
This program handles older Thunderbolt/Lightning parameter files and newer Panther/Lynx parameter files but it has a larger footprint that may not be acceptable for embedded systems.
In cases where only the older or the newer parameter files are used, consider using program \fBsetpib1\fR for an older Thunderbolt/Lightning\fR only version or \fBsetpib2\fR for a newer Panther/Lynx only version.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBAMP\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.RB - q
Enable quiet mode which has not effect.

.TP
.RB - v 
Print a hexdump of the edited region.
Print hexdump headers if this option appears twice.
The region window may be changed with option \fB-w\fR.

.TP
-\fBw \fIwindow\fR
The display window in bytes.
When option \fB-v\fR is present, PIB information surrounding the edited region is displayed to provide some sort of context.
The edited region appears in the middle of this window.
The default \fBwindow\fR is \fB32\fR bytes.
This means that the 32 bytes before and the 32 bytes after the edited region are included in the display.

.TP
.RB - x
Repair the checksum.
By default, this program does not modify files that fail the size or checksum test on input.
In addition, it does not re-compute the checksum on output if no data has changed.
This option skips the size and checksum test on input and re-computes the checksum on output even if no data has changed.
This option only works on legacy PIB files.
It does not work on PIB files having NVM file format.

.TP
-\fB?\fR, --\fBhelp\fR
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
-\fB!\fR, --\fBversion\fR
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Usethis option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR file
The PIB filename.
The file must exist and will be re-written.
No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.
This argument is required and must precede the \fBbase\fR argument.

.TP
.IR base
The byte offset where changes will start.
The offset is expressed in hexadecimal with (or without) the leading "\fB0x\fR".
Changes are applied in order, left to right, and offset automatically increments by the correct amount after each change is applied.
This permits consectuive PIB locations to be changed with one command.
This argument is required and must follow the \fBfile\fR argument.
It must also precede all format/data pairs.
Normally, you must use multiple \fBsetpib\fR commands to change non-consecutive PIB locations but careful use of format \fBskip\fR can achive the same results using one command.

.TP
.IB type
The implied length and encoding of the data.
Valid types are \fBbyte\fR, \fBword\fR, \fBlong\fR, \fBdata\fR and \fBhfid\fR.
A valid format must precede each data item.
A byte is 8 bits, a word is 16 bits, a long is 32 bits and a huge is 64 bits.
The format implies the maximum data value except for format \fBdata\fR which is limited by the number of octets entered on the command line.

.TP
.IB data
The information written to the current PIB offset.
Integer data may be expressed in binary, decimal or hexadecimal but must not exceed the \fBtype\fR minimum or maximum.
String data may contain any ASCII characters that can be entered via keyboard but must be enclosed in quotes when spaces are included.
Binary values start with \fB0b\fR or \fB0B\fR and hexadecimal values start with \fB0x\fR or \fB0X\fR.

.SH FORMATS

.TP
\fBbyte \fIinteger\fR
A signed or unsigned integer stored as 8 bits or 1 byte.
The value is expressed in decimal by default.
A binary value may be expressed with a \fB0b\fR prefix.
A hexadecimal value may be expressed using a \fB0x\fR prefix.
Negative type/data values must appear at the end of the command line, after option "\fB--\fR", to avoid parsing errors.
The offset increments by 1 prior to the next insertion.

.TP
\fBword \fIinteger\fR
A signed or unsigned integer stored as 16 bits or 2 bytes.
The value is expressed in decimal by default.
A binary value may be expressed with a \fB0b\fR prefix.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example edits file \fBabc.pib\fR by writing decimal value \fB1\fR at offset \fB01F7\fR followed by hexadecimal value \fB00B052BABE01\fR.
A partial dump is printed showing 16 bytes before and 16 bytes after the changed data because the default display windows is 16 bytes.
Unless the change occurs right at the start or end of the file, it will appear in the center of the display window.

The following example displays the contents of PIB file \fBabc.pib\fR without changing any data.
The region displayed is 24 bytes starting at offset 0x24.
The format \fBskip\fR specifies the region but does not change it.
By default, the 32 bytes before and 32 bytes after are included in the display.
This technique can be used to inspect a specific portion of a PIB file.

The next example does the same thing for a negative value.
This is tricky because the minus sign will be interpreted as the start of another option.
We must use "\fB--\fR" to end normal option parsing.
This is a POSIX standard feature.
See \fIIEEE Std 1002.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines\fR for more an explanation.

The following example computes a new checksum without changing any data.
The filename and an offset are required but no other values are needed.
This technique can be used to compute a new checksum after modifying the file using software that does not update the checksum.
