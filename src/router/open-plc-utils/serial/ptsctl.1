.SH NAME
ptsctl - PTS Module Controller

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR ptsctl
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Set attenuation level on the Qualcomm Atheros Production Test System using a local RS-232 communication port.
The port settings must be configured before running this program.
Settings are 9600 baud, no parity, 8 data and 1 stop bit.
See datasheet \fIhttp://www.weedtech.com/wtssr-m.pdf\fR for more information.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBf\fI file\fR
The name of the serial port.
On Linux, the name is usually "/dev/ttyS[0-4]".
On OS/X, the name is usually "/dev/cua[0-4]".
On Windows, the name is "com[0-9]:".
The default is "/dev/ttyS0" on Linux and "com1:" on Windows.
If environment string "\fBPTSCTL\fR" is defined then it takes precedence over the default serial port.
This option then takes precedence over either default.

.TP
-\fBg\fI attenuation\fR
The desired line/ground attenation in Decibels.
The value may be expressed in decimal, binary, or hexadecimal.
Binary varues start with "\fB0b\fR" and hexadecimal values start with "\fB0x\fR".
The default for this option is \fB127\fR dB.

.TP
-\fBn\fI attenuation\fR
The desired line/neutral attenation in Decibels.
The value may be expressed in decimal, binary, or hexadecimal.
Binary varues start with "0b" and hexadecimal values start with "0x".
The default for this option is \fB127\fR dB.

.TP
-\fBp\fI power\fR
Turn on or off the Device Under Test power.
The value of \fBpower\fR can be \fB1\fR=on or \fB0\fR=off.
Alternately, keywords "\fBon\fR" and "\fBoff\fR" can be used.

.TP
.RB - r
Read and display undecorated attenuator settings on stdout.
Setting appear as two decimal integers representing the attenuation in decibels.
The line/neutral setting appears first then the line/ground setting.
This option is independent of options \fB-n\fR and \fB-g\fR.
If this option is present and the other are missing then settings are display but not changed.
If this setting appears with either or both of the other two then the settings are changed then read and displayed.

.TP
-\fBw\fI wait\fR
Wait time in milliseconds.
Serial I/O operation are slow and a delay is needed after each write operation.
Unfortunately, different operating systems require different wait times.
This options lets you adjust the time.
The default is 10 milliseconds which should be adequate on most systems.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example turns the Device Under Test power on and configures the line/neutral attenuator for \fB72\fRdB attenuation.
Line ground attenation is automatically set to \fB127\fR dB since it is not specified on the command line.
Option \fB-p\fR is not necessary if the Device Under Test power is already on.

.PP
   # ptsctl -p 1 -n 72

.PP
The next example configures the controller for \fB42\fR dB attenuation on line/neutral and \fB100\fR dB on line/ground.
There is no needed to turn the Device Under Test on again because it remains on until turned off.

.PP
   # ptsctl -n 42 -g 100

.PP
The next example configures the controller for \fB56\fR dB attenuation on line/ground and \fB127\fR dB on line/neutral, and turns the Device Under Test off.

.PP
   # ptsctl -p off -g 56

.PP
The next example reads the atteuator setting and displays them on decimal format on stdout.
The line/neutral setting appears first then the line/ground setting.
In this example, line/neutral has \fB55\fR dB attenuation and line/ground has \fB120\fR dB attenuation.

.PP
   # ptsctl -r
   55 120

.PP
You can also set the attenuation and read it back using one command.
The next example sets line/neutral attenuation to \fB10\fR db and line/ground attenuation to \fB50\fR db then reads the attenuator settings and displays them in the standard order, line/neutral then line/ground.

.PP
   # ptsctl -g 50 -r -n 10 
   10 50
