.SH DESCRIPTION
.B This page is under construction.

.PP
Add a managed stream to one or more powerline devices using the VS_CONN_ADD message.
Consult the Qualcomm Atheros Firmware Technical Reference Manual for a description of this vendor specific message type.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBplc\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH BACKGROUND

.PP
Bandwidth management prioritizes streams so that data from lowest priority stream is dropped first whenever one of the following conditions is detected.
This ensures that the remaining streams continue operate at their full pontential.

.TP
.B Degraded line condition 
The channel degrades to the point where the available PHY rate from the transmitter to the receiver is too low due to the variability of the power line.s characteristics.

.TP
.B Over subscription 
Too much data is being sent per second, resulting in packet loss due to excessive collisions due to excessive channel oversubscription.

.TP
.B Lack of channel Capacity
On starting new source there is not enough channel capacity to support it.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.RB - e
Redirects stderr messages to stdout.
By convention progress messages and error messages are printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.
This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

.TP
-\fBi \fIinterface\fR
Select the host Ethernet interface.
All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via this host interface are recognized.
The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.
This option then takes precedence over either default.

.TP
.RB - q
Suppresses status messages on stderr.

.TP
.RB - r
Display relative memory offsets on output.
This option is the default.

.TP
.RB - v
Prints additional information on stdout.
In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Displays program help information on stderr.
This option takes precedence over all other options on the command line except version information.

.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Displays program version information on stderr.
This option takes precedence over all other options on the command line except help information.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros technical staff.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR action
The action taken for frames that satisfy the selection criteria.
Valid actions are "\fBCAP0\fR", "\fBCAP1\fR", "\fBCAP2\fR", "\fBCAP3\fR" to specify the channel access priority queue.
CAP0 and CAP1 are for best effort data.
CAP2 is for video and non urgent MMEs.
CAP3 is for voice, urgent MMEs and control messages such as IGMP and MLD.

.TP
.IR priority
The relative priority of this stream.
Valid values are \fB0\fR through \fB15\fR where 0 is the lowest priority and 15 is the highest.

.TP
.IR destination
The destination MAC address.

.TP
.IR rate
The average expected data rate for this stream.
Valid values are \fB1\fR to \fB9000\fR where units are in 10kbps so the minimum rate is 10kbps and the maximum rate is 90mbps.

.TP
.IR ttl
The time to live for this stream.
Valid values are 10000 to 2000000 where units are in microseconds so the minimum is time is 10 milliseconds and the maximum time is 2 seconds.

.TP
.IR operand
The operand specifies the logical relationship between conditions before the \fIaction\fR to be taken.
Valid operands are listed and described under \fBOPERANDS\fR.

.TP
.IR condition
A conditional expression consisting of a \fIfield\fR, \fIoperator\fR and \fIvalue\fR.
See \fBCONDITIONS\fR for more information.

.TP
.IR device
The MAC address of some powerline device.
More than one address may be specified on the command line.
If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.
The default address is "\fBlocal\fR".
See \fBDEVICES\fR for more information.

.SH CONDITIONS
A condition consists of a \fIfield\fR, an \fIoperator\fR and a \fIvalue\fR.
One condition is required but three are permitted.
Condition order is not important but all conditions must appear after the \fIoperand\fR and before the \fIcontrol\fR.

.TP
.IR field
The field is the part of the Ethernet frame to be examined.
Some fields are not valid for some actions but this program does not enforce such rules since validation is performed by runtime firmware on each device.
Recognized fields are listed and described under \fBFIELDS\fR.

.TP
.IR operator
The operator specifies the relationsip that must exist between the \fIfield\fR and \fIvalue\fR in order for the \fIcondition\fR to evaluate \fBTrue\fR.
Currently, only equality operators are supported.
Valid operators are listed and described under \fBOPERATORS\fR.

.TP
.IR value
The value must be appropriate to the field type.
Some fields are MAC or IP addresses, some are integers, some are bitmaps and others are states.
Integers and bitmaps may be expressed in binary, decimal or hexadecimal format.
Binary values staRt with \fB0b\fR.
Hexadecimal values start with \fB0x\fR.
States are expressed using keywords.
Users are responsible for knowing how many bits are significant for each type of value.
Valid values are described along with fields under \fBFIELDS\fR.

.SH OPERANDS
The \fIoperand\fR indicates the logical relationship that must exist between conditions in the rule set before the action is applied to a frame.
Operands are expressed as discrete alphanumeric strings entered in upper, lower or mixed character case.
Failure to enter a known operand will result in an error message that lists all possible operands.
They are positon sensitive.
One operand is allowed and it must appear after the \fIaction\fR and before any \fIcondition\fR.

.TP
.BR Any
Apply the action to frames that satisfy \fBany\fR of the conditions.
This is equivalent to the logical \fBor\fR operation.

.TP
.BR All
Apply the action to frames that satisfy \fBall\fR of the conditions.
This is equivalent to the logical \fBand\fR operation.

.TP
.BR Always
Apply the action to all frames, regardless of any and all conditions that may be specified.

.SH FIELDS
Fields indicate the portion of the frame that is inspected during selection and the size and format of the value permited in the condition statement.
They are expressed as discrete alphanumeric strings entered in upper, lower or mixed character case.
Failure to enter a known field will result in an error message that lists all possible fields.

.SH DISCLAIMER
Atheros HomePlug AV Vendor Specific Management Message structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.

Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to modify message structure and content in future firmware releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example adds a temporary stream to device \fB00:b0:52:BA:BE:01\fR which will then manage the bandwidth for that stream until removed with program \fBcoqos_rel\fR.

.PP
	# coqos_add CAP2 15 5000 200000 any ethda is 192.168.105 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01         

.PP
This adds a stream to the bandwidth manager that sets all traffic to destination address of 192.168.0.105 as priority 15 (the highest priority).
This would then need to also be sent to each device on the network.
Refer to int6krule for more details on how to specify conditions.
