.SH NAME
coqos_info - CoQoS Stream Utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR coqos_info
.RI [ options ]
.IR type
.RI [ cid ]
.RI [ limit ]
.RI [ device ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B This page is under construction.

.PP
None.

.P
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBplc\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.RB - e
Redirects stderr messages to stdout.
By convention progress messages and error messages are printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.
This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

.TP
-\fBi \fIinterface\fR
Select the host Ethernet interface.
All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via this host interface are recognized.
The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.
This option then takes precedence over either default.

.TP
.RB - q
Suppresses status messages on stderr.

.TP
.RB - r
Display relative memory offsets on output.
This option is the default.

.TP
.RB - v
Prints additional information on stdout.
In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Displays program help information on stderr.
This option takes precedence over all other options on the command line except version information.

.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Displays program version information on stderr.
This option takes precedence over all other options on the command line except help information.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros technical staff.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR type
The request type.
Valid types are "\fBSTA\fR", "\fBCID\fR", "\fBRSVD\fR", "\fBVIC\fR", "\fBBW\fR", and "\fBBW\fR".
Individual request types are described below.

.TP
.IR device
The MAC address of some powerline device.
More than one address may be specified on the command line.
If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.
The default address is "\fBlocal\fR".
See \fBDEVICES\fR for more information.

.SH TYPES

.TP
.BR STA
Station.
Request information on all active connections for this station.

.TP
\fBCID \fInumber\fR
Connection identifier.
If present, it must be followed by a valid connection identifier.
Connection identifiers are assigned when the connection is added using program \fBcoqos_add\fR.
The connection identifier is two bytes where byte 0 is the LLID-F and byte 1 is the OrigTEI.

.TP
.BR RSVD
Reserved.
Sets REQ_TYPE = 2 in the mme.

.TP
.BR VIC
Vicinity.
Provide all active connections in the vicinity.

.TP
\fB BW \fInumber\fR
Bandwidth.
set station to provide info when the limit is exceeded.
BW must be followed by a number.
This number is in units of 10kbps.
BWC cancels all previous requests.

.SH DEVICES
Ethernet MAC addresses are expressed as six hexadecimal octets optionally separated by colon.
For example, the Qualcomm Atheros Local Management Address (LMA) of "00b052000001" may also be entered as "00:b0:52:00:00:01" or "00b052:000001".
Addresses are case insensitive and quotes are optional.
In addition, some special addresses may be entered by name rather than number where names are case sensitive.

.TP
.BR all
A synonym for the "broadcast" address, described next.

.TP
.BR broadcast
A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, \fBFF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\fR.
All devices, whether local, remote or foreign will respond to this address.

.TP
.BR local
A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), \fB00:B0:52:00:00:01\fR.
All local Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not.
A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

.SH EXAMPLES
This command requests connection from the station

.PP
	# coqos_info STA 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01                

.PP
This command set the station to provide notification if the bandwidth used exceeds 20mbps

.PP
	# coqos_info BW 2000 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01
