.SH NAME
plctest - Qualcomm Atheros PLC Test Applet Loader

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR plctest
.RI [ options ] 
.RI [ file ] 
.RI [ file ] 
[...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Download and execute one or more test applets to the local Qualcomm Atheros powerline device.
An applet is a small firmware image that can be started by the bootloader and will return to the bootloader when done.
This program replaces \fBint6ktest\fR and \fBamptest\fR because is supports both old and new image file formats and the old and new powerline device boot methods.

.PP
Qualcomm Atheros firmware files may contain one or more applets.
Each applet is preceded by a header that specifies the image size, load address and start address and other information.
Program \fBplctest\fR sequentially dowloads and executes every applet in each image file named on the command line.
It waits for each applet to complete before downloading and executing the next one.
The program terminates once all applets in all files have been executed or some applet fails to complete within 60 seconds.

.PP
Most applets return to the Bootloader on successful completion so that another applet can be downloaded and executed.
This allows applet sequences to be executed with one command.
A sequence may consist of one file having multiple applets or multiple files each having one applet or any combination of single and multiple applet files.
The sequence will break, after a timeout, if any applet in the chain fails to return to the Bootloader in time.
Failure to return in time may be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on applet design.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBAPT\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH COMMENTS
The Powerline Toolkit contains a set of legacy applets in folder \fBapplets\fR.
These were originally designed for use with program \fBint6ktest\fR and most will not display console messages properly using this program; however, a new series of compatible applets are under development and should be available through \fBQualcomm Atheros Field Application Engineering\fR.

.PP
Assuming a good set of applets are available, this program is ideal for testing reference designs for performance and production units for defects.
Applets may become available for testing onboard connections, memory integrity and noise immunity.
Consult with Atheros Field Application Engineering for applet availability.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.RB - e
Redirects stderr messages to stdout.
By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.
This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

.TP
-\fBi\fR \fIinterface\fR
Select the host Ethernet interface.
All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via this host interface are recognized.
The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.
This option then takes precedence over either default.

.TP
.RB - l
Execute all applets in all files on the command line until the program is terminated using \fB^C\fR.

.TP
-\fBp \fIfrequency\fR
The polling frequency expressed in polls-per-second.
For example, 1 means one poll per second and 10 means ten polls per second.
Overall wait time is \fBcount/frequency\fR where count may be modified using option \fB-c\fR.
Overall wait time is always approximate since operating system overhead and latency are not taken into account.
The default frequency is \fB5\fR.

.TP
.RB - q
Suppresses normal progress and status messages.

.TP
-\fBt \fItimeout\fR
Read timeout in milliseconds.
Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.
This is the maximum time allowed for a response.
The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

.TP
.RB - v
Print additional information on stdout.
Specifically, this option prints incoming and outgoing frames in hexadecimal format on stdout.
Output can be directed to a text file for analysis.

.TP
-\fBw \fIseconds\fR
Application timeout in seconds.
This application will wait this long for an applet to terminate and return to the bootloader before reporting an error and proceeding to the next applet.

.TP
.RB - x
Exit program on first error instead of proceeding to the next applet.
Error exits return a non-zero value to the shell.

.TP
.RB - X
Exit program on first applet load instead of waiting for the applet to complete.
This exit returns a zero value to the shell.

.TP
-\fB?\fR, --\fBhelp\fR
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
-\fB!\fR, --\fBversion\fR
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
\fIfile\fR
The name of an Atheros image file.
The image file may contain one or more images.
Each image will be downloaded and executed in turn until all images are executed or an image fails to return to the Bootloader within 1 minute for some reason.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example sequentially downloads then executes each image in file \fBabc.nvm\fR in turn.
Each image must complete and return to the bootloader before the next one downloads.
Observe that no device address is needed because Atheros powerline devices use address 00:b0:52:00:00:01 when in bootloader mode.

.PP
   # plctest abc.nvm

.PP
The following example will sequentially download and execute the images in each file \fBabc.nvm\fR, \fBdef.nvm\fR and \fBghi.nvm\fR in turn.

.PP
   # plctest abc.nvm def.nvm ghi.nvm
