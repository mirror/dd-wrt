.SH DESCRIPTION
Collect and display MDU traffic statisitcs using the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific VS_MDU_TRAFFIC_STATS message.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBplc\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBc\fI command\fR
An integer indicating the type of statistics to be collected and reported.
Permitted values are \fB0\fR through \fB255\fR decimal but only \fB4\fR through \fB15\fR are valid at this time.
This option is mandatory because the default value of \fB0\fR is invalid.
 4 - retrieve traffic statistics on the slave side
 5 - retrieve traffic statistics (master TX/RX) collected on the master side
 6 - retrieve traffic statistics (slave TX/RX) collected on the master side
 7 - retrieve traffic statistics (master/slave TX/RX) collected on the master side
 8 - clear traffic statistics on the slave side
 9 - clear traffic statistics (master TX/RX) colleted on the master side
 10 - clear traffic statistics (slave TX/RX) collected on the master side
 11 - clear traffic statistics (master/slave TX/RX) collected on the master side
 12 - retrieve then clear traffic statistics collected on the slave side
 13 - retrieve then clear traffic statistics (master TX/RX) collected on the master side
 14 - retrieve then clear traffic statistics (slave TX/RX) collected on the master side
 15 - retrieve then clear traffic statistics (master/slave TX/RX) collected on the master side

.TP
-\fBs\fI session\fR
The session identifier used to associate request/confirm message pairs.
Valid identifiers are \fB0\fR through \fB255\fR.
The default is \fB0\fR.

.TP
-\fBt \fImilliseconds\fR
Read timeout in milliseconds.
Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.
This is the maximum time allowed for a response.
The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

.TP
-\fBu\fI unit\fR
The slave unit number.
This is the same as the slave Terminal Equipment Identifier or \fBTEI\fR.
Valid unit numbers are \fB0\fR through \fB255\fR.
Unit \fB0\fR is the default.
This option is ignored when option \fB-c\fR specified any of the "slave side" commands \fB4\fR, \fB8\fR or \fB12\fR.

.TP
.RB - v
Print additional information on stdout.

.TP
.RB - x
Cause the program to exit on the first error instead of continuing with remaining iterations, operations or devices.
Normally, the program reports errors and moves on to the next operation, iteration or device depending on the command line.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR device
The Ethernet hardware address of some powerline device.
More than one address may be specified on the command line.
If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.
The default address is \fBlocal\fR.
as explained in the \fBDEVICES\fR section.

.SH DEVICES
Powerline devices use Ethernet hardware, or Media Access Control (MAC), addresses.
Device addresses are expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits (\fB0123456789ABCDEFabcdef\fR) in upper, lower or mixed case.
Individual octets may be separated by colons, for clarity, but not all octets need to be seperated.
For example, "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are valid and equivalent.

.PP
These symbolic addresses are recognized by this program and may be used instead of the actual address value.

.TP
.BR all
Equivalent to "broadcast", described next.

.TP
.BR broadcast
A synonym for the standard Ethernet broadcast address, \fBFF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\fR.
All devices, whether local, remote or foreign will respond to this address.

.TP
.BR local
A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), \fB00:B0:52:00:00:01\fR.
All local Atheros devices will recognize this address but remote and foreign devices will not.
A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

.SH REFERENCES
See the Qualcomm Atheros \fIPowerline Firmware Technical Reference Manual\fR for more information about MDU powerline configuration and the VS_MDU_TRAFFIC_STATS message type.

.SH DISCLAIMER
Atheros HomePlug AV Vendor Specific Management Message structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.
Consequently, public information may not be available.
Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to modify message structure or content in future firmware releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example collects and displays MDU traffic statistics on the slave side of the local device because option \fB-c\fR is \fB4\fR.
The local device is implicit because no device is specified on the command line.

.PP
   # mdustats -c 4 

.PP
The next example collects and displays MDU traffic statistics for slave \fB2\fR on the master side of device \fB00:b0:52:9F:E0:14\fR because option \fB-c\fR is \fB5\fR and option \fB-s\fR is \fB2\fR.
The master device is explicit in this example.
