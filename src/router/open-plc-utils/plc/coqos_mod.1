.SH NAME
coqos_mod - Suspend or resume a managed data stream

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR coqos_mod
.RI [ options ]
.IR action
.IR cid
.RI [ device ]
[...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B This page is under construction.

.PP
Suspend or resume a stream through the bandwidth manager using an Atheros vendor specific VS_MOD_CONN message.
This is the proper way to stop a stream flowing if the data rate exceeds the available bandwidth.
Use program \fBcoqos_man\fR to set stream bandwidth.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBplc\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.RB - e
Redirects stderr messages to stdout.
By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.
This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

.TP
-\fBi \fIinterface\fR
Select the host Ethernet interface.
All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via this host interface are recognized.
The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.
This option then takes precedence over either default.

.TP
.RB - q
Suppresses status messages on stderr.

.TP
.RB - r
Display relative memory offsets on output.
This option is the default.

.TP
.RB - v
Prints additional information on stdout.
In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help   
Displays program help information on stderr.
This option takes precedence over all other options on the command line except version information.

.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Displays program version information on stderr.
This option takes precedence over all other options on the command line except help information.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros technical staff.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR action
A symbol indicating the action to be performed on the stream identified by argument \fIcid\fR.
Valid actions are "\fBsuspend\fR" and "\fBresume\fR".
See \fBACTIONS\fR for an explanation of each action.

.TP
.IR cid
A connection identifier.
(\fBCharlie, expand on this.\fR)
Connection ID.
2 byte number to identify the stream to delete.
Byte 0 is the OrigTEI and byte one is the LLID-F.

.TP
.IR device
The MAC address of some powerline device.
More than one address may be specified on the command line.
If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.
The default address is "\fBlocal\fR".
See \fBDEVICES\fR for more information.

.SH ACTIONS

.TP
.BR suspend
Suspend the identified stream.
See argument \fIcid\fR for more information.

.TP
.BR resume
Resume the identified stream.
See argument \fIcid\fR for more information.

.SH DEVICES
Ethernet MAC addresses are expressed as six hexadecimal octets optionally separated by colon.
For example, the Qualcomm Atheros Local Management Address (LMA) of "00b052000001" may also be entered as "00:b0:52:00:00:01" or "00b052:000001".
Addresses are case insensitive and quotes are optional.
In addition, some special addresses may be entered by name rather than number where names are case sensitive.

.TP
.BR all
A synonym for the "broadcast" address, described next.

.TP
.BR broadcast
A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, \fBFF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\fR.
All devices, whether local, remote or foreign will respond to this address.

.TP
.BR local
A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), \fB00:B0:52:00:00:01\fR.
All local Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not.
A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
..SH DEVICES
Ethernet MAC addresses are six hexadecimal octets optionally separated by colon.
For example, the addresses "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are all valid and equivalent.
Certain Ethernet device addresses are special and may be entered by name rather than number.

.TP
.BR all
A synonym for "broadcast", described next.

.TP
.BR broadcast
A synonym for the standard Ethernet broadcast address, \fBFF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\fR.
All devices, whether local, remote or foreign will respond to this address.

.TP
.BR local
A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), \fB00:B0:52:00:00:01\fR.
All local Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not.
A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example suspends a stream \fB805\fR.
All data in this cid will be discarded and not sent over the channel.
