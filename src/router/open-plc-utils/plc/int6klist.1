.SH NAME
int6klist - List Atheros Device Addresses

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR int6klist
.RI [ options ] 
.RI [ device ] 
.RI [ device ] 
[...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
print the local device address or all network device addresses for a specific device.
This program is ideal for that special \fBscript jokey\fR in your life.
It only prints device addresses.
Nothing else.

.PP
Devices are detected using one of two methods.
The two methods can be used in combination to determine network topology.

.PP
The first method sends one VS_SW_VER message to the Qualcomm Atheros Local Management Address and prints the Ethernet source address found in each received confirmation message.
The method is used when no device addresses appear on the command line.
The result is a list of all local devices, being this connected directly to the local host.
Each local device device may bridge to an independent powerline network having remote devices as members.

.PP
The second method sends one VS_NW_INFO message to each specified device and prints the Ethernet source address found in each received message plus the Ethernet addresses of each network station identified in that message body.
This method is used whenever one, or more, device addresses appear on the command line.
It is possible to query remote powerline devices directly and so duplicate devices addresses are printed when devices share powerline neighbors.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBplc\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.RB - b
Print bridge device addresses.
Each specified device reports it's own address. This option has no effect if no devices are specified. 
.TP
.RB - i
Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via this host interface are recognized. The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.
.TP
.RB - n
Append a newline to output. 
.TP
.RB - q
Enter quiet mode. This option has no effect at this time.
.TP
.RB - r
Print remote device addresses. Each specified device reports neighbor device addresses. This option has no effect when no devices are speceified. 
.TP
.RB - s
Insert a newline, instead of a space, between each device address.
.TP
.RB - v 
Enter verbose mode. All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program are displayed on stdout.
.TP
-\fB?\fR, --\fBhelp\fR
Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. 
.TP
-\fB!\fR, --\fBversion\fR
Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.BR device
The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified. If omitted the the program output consists of local device addresses only. Otherwise, output conisists of the specified device followed by all devices associated with it. The default address is \fBlocal\fR. See \fBDEVICES\fR for information about symbolic device addresses.
.SH DEVICES
Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case. Octets may be separated with colons for clarity. For example, "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are valid and equivalent.
.PP
The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.
.TP
.BR all
Same as "broadcast".
.TP
.BR broadcast
A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, \fBFF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\fR. All devices, whether local, remote or foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
.TP
.BR local
A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), \fB00:B0:52:00:00:01\fR. All local Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following command lists all local devices because no device was specified. Because no devices are specified on the command line, a VS_SW_VER message is sent to 00:B0:52:00:00:01 and device responses are collected. As we can see, there is only one local device available at this time. Observe that the prompt appears immediately after the address because newlines are omitted by default. 
.PP
   # int6klist
   00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 #
.PP
The next examples do the same thing but this time there are several local devicer available. 
.PP
   # int6klist
   00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 # int6k
.PP
The next example queries the first local device from the previous example, 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04, for a list neighbor devices. This time a VS_NW_INFO message is sent because we named a device on the command line. The named device happens to be a local device but it need not be. We can see that the device has no neighbors. 
.PP
   # int6klist 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04
   00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 # int6k
.PP
The next example we query the next ocal device, 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02, and find that it has two neighbor devices that did not show up earlier because they are remote devices. Observe that the three devices comprise a complete logical powerline network. Device 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 is connected to the local host but 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 and 00:0f:00:F2:01:13 are connected to other hosts, somewhere.
.PP
   # int6klist 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02
   00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13 
.PP
The next example shows that we can query multiple devices at a time for neighbors. We have copied the output from the second example and pasted it onto the command line. We now have a list of all devices, local and remote.
.PP
   # int6klist 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 
   00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13 
.PP
This next example does the same thing but uses option \fB-n\fR to append a newline after each query. This output is eaiser to understand because each device queried starts on a new line and is followed by any neighbors.
.PP
   # int6klist 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 -n
   00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 
   00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13 
   00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 
.PP
This example invokes \fBint6klist\fR which returns a list of local devices. That list is inserted into another \fBint6klist\fR command line. This demontrates how program output can be used in scripts. 
.PP
   # int6klist $(int6klist) -n
   00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 
   00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13 
   00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 
.PP
This next example accomplishes the same thing since all local device respond with a list of powerline neighbors. 
.PP
   # int6klist local
   00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 
   00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13 
   00:B0:52:BA:BE:01
