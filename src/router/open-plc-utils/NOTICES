You may install and use any number of copies of the trial software on your devices. You may only use the trial software for internal evaluation purposes. For example, your trial rights do not include the right to deploy or distribute any programs you design or develop with the software for use in a production environment, except that you may deploy your programs internally solely to evaluate the software.

Your rights to use the trial software are limited to ninety (90) days. The trial software will present conversion options to you thirty (30) days after you install the trial software. At that time you may either request an additional 60-day trial period extension or purchase a commercial license to continue using the software. After the expiration of the 90-day trial period, without conversion, the trial software will stop running.

	- Sections 1-3, 10 - 13, 15, 16, 19 and Limited Warranty do not apply. The remaining sections below apply.
