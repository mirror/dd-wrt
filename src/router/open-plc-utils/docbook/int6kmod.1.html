int6kmod(1)                                  Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                 int6kmod(1)

NAME
       int6kmod - Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Device Module Manager

SYNOPSIS
       int6kmod [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Read or write Atheros custom powerline modules using VS_MODULE_OPERATION messages.  Modules may be read from a device and
       written to a file or read from a file and written to a device.  Modules may have any of  several  formats  and  purposes.
       Where the firmware permits, this program can now read modules in excess of 1400 bytes and can write multiple modules that
       exceed 1400 bytes in one operation.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -d     Read the specified module from NVRAM and write to standard output in hexadecimal dump format.  The module is iden‐
              tified by module and sub-module using options -t and -s.  Runtime firmware will report an error if the  module  is
              not  available.   The  session identifier is not required for a module read operation and is ignored.  The largest
              module that can be read is 1400 bytes.  This option and option -m are mutually exclusive.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -m filename
              Read the specified module from NVRAM and write it to the named file.  The module is identified by module and  sub-
              module  using  options -t and -s.  Runtime firmware will report an error if the module is not available.  The ses‐
              sion identifier is not required for a module read operation and is ignored.  The largest module that can  be  read
              is 1400 bytes.  This option and option -d are mutually exclusive.

       -M filename
              Read the named module file and download it to the named device and commit NVRAM.  The module is assigned to a mod‐
              ule and sub-module identifier using options -t and -s.  Runtime firmware will reject modules having invalid module
              and  sub-mocule  identifiers.   Module  files  must be a multiple of four bytes or an error will occur.  As imple‐
              mented, int6kmod will reject files exceeding 1400 bytes but this restriction will be removed in later versions.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -s sub-module-id
              The sub-module identifier expressed as a 16-bit hexadecimal value with optional 0x prefix.  This identifier  indi‐
              cates  a  specific module with the module class specified using option -t.  Any 16-bit value is permitted but only
              certain values are accepted by device firmware depending on firmware type and  revision.   The  default  value  is
              0x0000.

       -S session-id
              The  session  identifier  expressed as a 32-bit hexadecimal value with optional 0x prefix.  The session identifier
              value is arbitrary and so any 32-bit value is permitted but 0x00000000 and 0xFFFFFFFF are illegal.  The 0x  prefix
              is optional for this argument.  The default session-id is 0x78563412.

       -t module-id
              The  module identifier expressed as a 16-bit hexadecimal value with optional 0x prefix.  This identifier indicates
              the module type or class.  Option -s indicates the specific member of a module class.  Any 16-bit value is permit‐
              ted but only certain values will be accepted by device firmware.  The default value is 0x0000.

       -v     Print  additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets which can
              be saved as text files for reference.

       -w     Write settings to the device instead of reading settings from the device.  If omitted then settings are read  from
              the device and displayed.  If present, the user should specify all settings to avoid writing default values to the
              device.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified on the command  line.   If  more
              than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is local.
              See DEVICES for information.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12  hex‐
       adecimal  digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local,  remote  or  foreign
              recognize  messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.   All  local
              Atheros  devices  recognize  this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is any device at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

EXAMPLES
       The following command reads module file abc.bin and writes it to the local device.  The module  identifier  0x1000  indi‐
       cates  that  it  is  an MDIO Init module.  The sub-module identifer defaults to 0x0000 because option -s is omitted.  The
       session identifier defaults to 0x78563412 because option -S is omitted.  The operation takes place in three  steps.   The
       last step may take 2 or 3 seconds to complete.

          # int6kmod -M abc.bin -t 0x1000
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Request Session
          eth1 00:B0:52:BE:EF:03 Request Granted
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write abc.bin
          eth1 00:B0:52:BE:EF:03 Written
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Commit Modules
          eth1 00:B0:52:BE:EF:03 Committed

       The next example does the same thing but writes module file def.bin to remote device 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02.  The module iden‐
       tifier 0x4000 indicates that it is an Advanced Power Management uC module.  The session identifier  used  is  0xA5A5A5A5.
       The sub-module identifer defaults to 0x0000 because option -s is omitted.

          # int6kmod -M def.bin -t 0x4000 -S A5A5A5A5 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Request Session
          eth1 00:B0:52:BE:EF:03 Request Granted
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write abc.bin
          eth1 00:B0:52:BE:EF:03 Written
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Commit Modules
          eth1 00:B0:52:BE:EF:03 Committed

       The next example reads back the module written in the first example and saves it in file zyx.bin.

          # int6kmod -m xyz.bin -t 0x1000
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Read zyx.bin
          eth1 00:B0:52:BE:EF:03 Read
