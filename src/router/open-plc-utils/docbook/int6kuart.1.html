int6kuart(1)                                 Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                int6kuart(1)

NAME
       int6kuart - Qualcomm Atheros Serial Line Device Manager

SYNOPSIS
       int6kuart [options] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Perform powerline device management operations over serial line interface.

       Serial  line  commands  are  7-bit  ASCII character strings sent to the local powerline device over the host serial port.
       They can be sent using any terminal emulator but this program will, in many cases, reduce typing and simplify  scripting.
       It is especially useful for downloading device parameters and uploading device parameters or firmware because those oper‚Äê
       ations involve large volumes of data.  Also, this program permits decimal integer  arguments  in  many  cases  where  the
       serial line commands require hexadecimal integer values.  See the COMMANDS section (below) for a list of supported serial
       line commands.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

COMMENTS
       This  program  does not configure or reconfigure host serial port settings by default because most operating systems have
       their own serial port configuration utility.  Be sure to configure host serial port settings before  using  this  program
       because  other programs may change them before or after use.  Atheros factory default settings for UART-enabled powerline
       devices are 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity and no flow control.  See option -b for a quick way to  match
       host serial port settings the Qualcomm Atheros default settings.

       On  Windows, use the DOS mode command.  The general form of this command is mode,baud,parity,databits,stopbits.  The fol‚Äê
       lowing example will set a Windows host to the default serial settings used by Atheros powerline devices.

          # mode com3:115200,n,8,1

       On Linux, use the stty utility to inspect and set serial port parameters.  The following  Linux  command  will  configure
       serial  device  /dev/ttyS0 speed to 115200 baud with 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity bit and no flow control.  Consult
       the stty man page for an explanation of these and other options.

          # stty -F /dev/ttyS0 115200 cs8 cstopb -parenb -ixon

       On Linux, you can also use the minicom terminal emulator  to  communicate  using  the  underlying  serial  line  commands
       described  in  the  COMMANDS  section.   The  minicom  program  reads default settings from configuration file /etc/mini‚Ä‚Äê
       com/minirc.dfl if present on startup.  A basic configuration file looks like this:

          pu port             /dev/ttyUSB0
          pu baudrate         115200
          pu bits             8
          pu parity           N
          pu stopbits         1
          pu rtscts           No

OPTIONS
       -b     Set host serial port to the default settings mentioned above.  The original host  serial  port  settings  are  not
              restored  when  the  program  terminates.  You must restore them manually or by other means.  Changing host serial
              port settings will break serial communications with the local powerline device if the device is not using the same
              settings.

       -c command
              Send  a custom serial line command to the local powerline device over the host serial interface.  Argument command
              is sent as specified but will be terminated with a carriage return.  The command must be enclosed in quotes if  it
              contains  spaces  or  special  characters.  This option can be used to send serial line commands that are not sup‚Äê
              ported by this program.

       -C module
              Commit downloaded parameters and/or firmware to NVM using the ATWNV serial line command.  Argument module  is  one
              hexadecimal octet.  The low-order nibble contains the module number.  The high-order nibble contains optional con‚Äê
              trol bits.  Acceptable module values are 0x01=Firmware, 0x02=Parameters, 0x10=Force Flash and 0x20=Do Not  Reboot.
              The default value is 0x00 which has no effect.  The 0x prefix is optional.

       -d     Read  and  display  the destination device address using the ATDST serial line command.  This option is similar to
              option -D but substitutes ? for the device address.

       -D address
              Set the destination device address for Transparent Mode using the ATDST serial line command.   This  address  will
              supercede the default destination device address, stored in the PIB, until the device is reset.  Multicast address
              values are not permitted by the device.  Argument address  is  six  hexadecimal  octets  optionally  separated  by
              colons.

       -F filename
              Read  the named frame description file and send it over powerline as an Atheros vendor-specific management message
              using the ATM serial line command.  Unlike program efsu, only the first file frame is sent.  Any subsequent frames
              defined in the file are ignored.

       -H     Exit Command Mode and enter High Speed Command Mode using the ATHSC serial line command.

       -i     Get  and  display  network  information using the ATNI serial line command.  The information includes the TEI, MAC
              address, receive rate and transmit rate for each remote device on the network.

       -I     Get and display the PIB version and device MAC address using the ATRPM serial line command.

       -m     Read and display the Network Membership Key of the local powerline device using  the  ATSK  serial  line  command.
              This option is similar to option -M but substitutes ? for the membership key.

       -M key Set the Network Membership Key of the local powerline device using the ATSK serial line command.  The key consists
              of 16 hexadecimal octets optionally separated by colons.

       -N filename
              Open the named firmware file on the local host and write it to the local device using multiple ATWPF  serial  line
              commands.  There is no default filename or extension.  The file is assumed to contain a valid firmware image.

       -O     Exit  Command  Mode  and enter Transparent Mode using the ATO serial line command.  Subsequent serial data will be
              transmitted over the powerline to the destination device address as raw data.  Use option -d to set  the  destina‚Äê
              tion device address.

       -p filename
              Read  the  parameter  block from the local powerline device and write it to the named file on the local host using
              multiple ATRP serial line commands.  Required length and offset values are automatically computed for each  serial
              line command sent.  There is no default filename or extention.

       -P filename
              Open  the  parameter file on the local host and write it to the local powerline device using multiple ATWPF serial
              line commands.  Required length and offset values are automatically computed for each serial  line  command  sent.
              There is no default filename or extention.  The named file is assumed to contain a valid parameter block.

       -q     Suppress progress and error information on stderr.

       -r     Read  and display the local powerline device hardware identifier and firmware version string using the ATRV serial
              line command.

       -R     Reset the local device using the ATZ serial line command

       -s tty Communicate with the local powerline device over the named serial  interface  on  the  local  host.   The  program
              default is &quot;/dev/ttyUSB0&quot; for Linux and &quot;com1:&quot; for Windows.  The program default is replaced if environment vari‚Äê
              able PLCUART is defined.  This option over-rides those default settings.

       -S     Place the local power line device in Power Save Mode using the ATPS serial line command.

       -t     Test device using the AT serial line command.  The device will respond with &quot;OK&quot; when in Command Mode.

       -T     Restore factory defaults on the local power line device using the ATFD serial line command.  Among  other  things,
              this will restore the destination device address stored in the factory PIB.  Any destination device address previ‚Äê
              ously set using option -d will be lost.

       -u     Force default host port settings to match the default setting for UART-enabled  Atheros  powerline  devices.   The
              setting  are  115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity bits and 1 stop bit.  These settings will remain active when the
              program terminates and will not change unless changed by some other means, perhaps by another  application.   This
              option  is  an easy means of establishg an initial serial connection with a powerline device, unless it‚Äôs settings
              have been changed.

       -v     Display actual serial line commands and responses on stdout.

       -w     Place the local powerline device in Command Mode using the +++ serial line command. The device will remain in com‚Äê
              mand mode until it is reset or forced into Transparaent Mode or High Speed Command Mode.

       -W timeout
              Set the Transparent Mode aggregation timeout using the ATTO serial line command. The timeout is expressed in deci‚Äê
              mal milliseconds. Valid values are 1 through 2000.

       -z     Get the Transparent Mode buffer size using the ATBSZ serial line command. This option is similar to option -B  but
              substitutes ? for the buffer size.

       -Z size
              Set  the Transparent Mode buffer size using the ATBSZ serial line command. The size in bytes is specified in deci‚Äê
              mal here and converted to hexadecimal for transmission. Valid values range from 46 to 1500.  The  default  is  500
              bytes.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print  program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       None.

COMMANDS
       This  section  lists  serial  line  commands  recognized by local powerline devices when in Command Mode. Commands can be
       issued interactively using a terminal emulator, like minicom on Linux or HyperTerminal on Windows or stored as  text  and
       copied  to the serial port using system utilities, like cat on Linux or type on Windows. This program merely converts the
       command line options and arguments described above into one or more of the serial line commands shown below.

       +++    Exit Transparent Mode and enter Command Mode. See option -w above.

       AT     Test for Command Mode by doing nothing, successfully. See option -t above.

       ATBRmode,baudrate,databits,parity,stopbits,flowctrl
              Set serial line parameters on the local powerline device. Beware that this will break the existing serial  connec‚Äê
              tion when the new parameters differ from those of the local host.

       ATBSZ? Get Transparent Mode buffer size. See option -z above.

       ATBSZsize
              Set Transparent Mode buffer size. See option -Z above.

       ATDST? Get Transparent Mode destination device address. See option -d above.

       ATDSTaddress
              Set Transparent Mode destination device address. See option -D above.

       ATFD   Reset local device to factory defaults. See option -T above.

       ATHSC  Exit  Command Mode and enter High Speed Command Mode. Once the OK response is received, the local host should send
              commands to the device at successively higher speeds until a valid response is received.

       ATMmessage
              Send an Atheros vendor-specific management message over powerline. The message is expressed as a  series  of  hex‚Äê
              adecimal digits.

       ATNI?  Read  nework information and store the information internally. Return the number of associated stations and infor‚Äê
              mation about the first associated station. The information includes the peer station device address, TX  rate  and
              RX rate.

       ATNIstation
              Extract and display previously stored network information for a specific peer station. The information returned is
              that previosly stored using a ATNI serial line command query.

       ATO    Exit Command Mode and enter Transparent Mode. Successful switch requires a valid destination MAC  address,  buffer
              size  and aggregation timeout value. Use serial line commands ATDST and ATBSZ to get and/or set the first two val‚Äê
              ues. Use serial line command ATTO to set the timeout value.

       ATPStime
              Place the device in Power Save Mode for a specified time in seconds. Valid  values  are  1  to  384  seconds.  The
              default time is A seconds.

       ATRPlength,offset
              Read  and  display  a  parameter block segment where length is the number of bytes read and offset is the relative
              position, in bytes, from the start of the parameter block. Valid length values are 0 through 400 hexadecimal.  See
              option -p above to read and save an entire parameter block.

       ATRPM  Get PIB version and device MAC address.

       ATRV   Get hardware and firmware revision. See option -r above.

       ATSK?  Get device Network Membership Key. See option -m above.

       ATSKkey
              Set device Network Membership Key. See option -M above.

       ATTO?  Get the Transparent Mode aggregation timeout in milliseconds.

       ATTOtimeout
              Set the Transparent Mode aggregation timeout in milliseconds. See option -W above.

       ATWNVmodule
              Update NVM with PIB and/or Firmware module. See option -C above.

       ATWPFmodule,length,offset,checksum,data
              Write  a  parameter block or firmware segment to the local powerline device where module is the module identifier,
              length is the number of bytes to write, offset is the relative position from the start of the module, checksum  is
              the  1‚Äôs  complement of the data and data is the data to be written.  Valid module identifiers are 1=FW and 2=PIB.
              Valid length values are 0 up to 400 hexadecimal.  See options -N and -P above to write an entire  parameter  block
              or firmware images.

       ATZ    Reset device.  See option -R above.

DISCLAIMER
       Atheros  serial line commands are proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.  Consequently, public information is not
       available.  Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to modify command line syntax or command functionality in future firmware
       releases without any obligation to notify or compensate product or program users.

EXAMPLES
       The  following example places the device in Command Mode (wakeup).  Serial line commands are ignored unless the device is
       in this mode so this is often the first command issued.

          # int6kuart -w

       The next example sets the destination device address on the local powerline  device  to  00B052BABE12.   The  destination
       device can be any remote powerline device on the same logical network as the local device.

          # int6kuart -D 00:B0:52:BA:BE:12

       The next example places the device in Transparent Mode where serial line output is sent over powerline to the destination
       powerline device and forwarded the remote host connected to it.

          # int6kuart -O

       The next example sends the serial line command &quot;ATSK?&quot; to the local powerline device.

          # int6kuart -c &quot;ATSK?&quot;
