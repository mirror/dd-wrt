amplist(1)                                   Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                  amplist(1)

NAME
       amplist - List Atheros Device Addresses

SYNOPSIS
       amplist [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       print  the  local  device  address or all network device addresses for a specific device.  This program is ideal for that
       special script jokey in your life.  It only prints device addresses.  Nothing else.

       Devices are detected using one of two methods.  The two methods can be used in combination to determine network topology.

       The  first  method  sends  one VS_SW_VER message to the Qualcomm Atheros Local Management Address and prints the Ethernet
       source address found in each received confirmation message.  The method is used when no device addresses  appear  on  the
       command  line.   The  result is a list of all local devices, being this connected directly to the local host.  Each local
       device device may bridge to an independent powerline network having remote devices as members.

       The second method sends one VS_NW_INFO message to each specified device and prints the Ethernet source address  found  in
       each  received  message plus the Ethernet addresses of each network station identified in that message body.  This method
       is used whenever one, or more, device addresses appear on the command line.  It is possible  to  query  remote  powerline
       devices directly and so duplicate devices addresses are printed when devices share powerline neighbors.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

COMMENTS
       This program is identical to legacy program int6klist but uses version 1 of the Qualcomm Atheros  VS_NW_INFO  vendor-spe‐
       cific message.  Older firmware versions may not recognize this message version.

OPTIONS
       -b     Print  bridge  device  addresses.  Each specified device reports it’s own address. This option has no effect if no
              devices are specified.

       -i     Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses  received  via
              this  host interface are recognized. The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network connection; however, if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it  takes  precedence  over  the  default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -n     Append a newline to output.

       -q     Enter quiet mode. This option has no effect at this time.

       -r     Print  remote device addresses. Each specified device reports neighbor device addresses. This option has no effect
              when no devices are specified.

       -s     Insert a newline, instead of a space, between each device address.

       -v     Enter verbose mode. All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program are displayed on stdout.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command  line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified. If omitted the the program  out‐
              put  consists  of local device addresses only. Otherwise, output conisists of the specified device followed by all
              devices associated with it. The default address is local.  See  DEVICES  for  information  about  symbolic  device
              addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices  use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hex‐
       adecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case. Octets may be separated with colons for  clarity.  For  example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the  Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. All devices, whether local, remote or foreign
              recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline  connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A  synonym  for  the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01. All local
              Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the
              far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

EXAMPLES
       The following command lists all local devices. Since no devices are specified on the command line, one VS_SW_VER  message
       is  addressed  to 00:B0:52:00:00:01 and the responses are collected. As we can see, there is only one local device avail‐
       able at this time. Observe that the prompt appears immediately after the address because newlines are omitted by default.

          # amplist
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 #

       The  next  example  does  the  same  thing  but there are now three local devices available. Observe that all devices are
       printed without intervening newlines so that the output of this program can be used as input to other toolkit programs.

          # amplist
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 # int6k

       The next example queries the first local device from  the  previous  example,  00:B0:52:BE:EF:04,  for  a  list  neighbor
       devices.  This  time a VS_NW_INFO message is sent because we named a device on the command line. The named device happens
       to be a local device but it need not be. We can see that the device has no neighbors.

          # amplist 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 # int6k

       The next example we query the next local device, 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02, and find that it has two neighbor  devices  that  did
       not show up earlier because they are remote devices. Observe that the three devices comprise a complete logical powerline
       network. Device 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 is connected to the local host but 00:0F:33:F2:01:21  and  00:0f:00:F2:01:13  are  con‐
       nected to other hosts, somewhere.

          # amplist 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13

       The  next  example  shows  that we can query multiple devices at a time for neighbors. We have copied the output from the
       second example and pasted it onto the command line. We now have a list of all devices, local and remote.

          # amplist 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13

       This next example does the same thing but uses option -n to append a newline after each query. This output is  eaiser  to
       understand because each device queried starts on a new line and is followed by any neighbors.

          # amplist 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 -n
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:01

       This  example  invokes  amplist which returns a list of local devices. That list is inserted into another amplist command
       line. This demontrates how program output can be used in scripts.

          # amplist $(amplist) -n
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:01

       This next example accomplishes the same thing since all local device respond with a list of powerline neighbors.

          # amplist local
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:01
