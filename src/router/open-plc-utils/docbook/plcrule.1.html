plcrule(1)                                   Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                  plcrule(1)

NAME
       plcrule - Stream Classification Utility

SYNOPSIS
       plcrule [options] action operand condition [condition] [condition] control volatility [device] [device] [...]

       where condition is a field operator value sequence.

DESCRIPTION
       Format  and  send  stream  classification rules to one or more devices.  Rules specify an action to be taken when a frame
       satisfies selection criteria.  Selection criteria consists of one, two or three conditions where any  or  all  conditions
       must  be satisfied.  Each condition consists of a field type, a relational operator and a value.  Rules may be added to a
       device, or removed from a device, so that they have permanent or temporary effect.

       Classification rules are cumulative.  If a new rule set is identical to an old rule set then an error will  occur  unless
       it  contains a different Transmission Action.  In that case the old rule will be replaced.  Identical classification rule
       sets are permitted if one of the sets is associated with a VLAN tag action.  Classification  is  based  on  the  original
       frame before is is altered by VLAN Tag insertion or removal.

       Classification  is  multi-dimensional  and  the  terminology  used here may seem strange at first.  Refer to the Qualcomm
       Atheros Firmware Techncial Reference Manual description of the VS_CLASSIFICATION management message for a  full  explana‐
       tion.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -r     Read rules from a device and display them on stdout.

       -s     Print a list of program keywords on stdout.  This option over-rides all others, except -? and -!, and the  program
              will terminate without further action.

       -t milliseconds
              Read  timeout  in  milliseconds.   Values  range  from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is the maximum time allowed for a
              response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.  -T tag The VLAN tag to be inserted  into  frames
              before  they  are transmitted.  The tag is a 32-bit hexadecimal integer with optional &quot;0x&quot; prefix.  This option is
              required for action TagTX and must be omitted for all other actions.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets which  can
              be saved as text files for reference.

       -V version
              The  CSPEC  version  number  expressed  as a small decimal integer.  This option is required (and should be 2) for
              action TagTX and must be omitted for all other actions.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       action The action to be taken for frames that meet any (or  all)  selection  criteria.   Valid  actions  are  listed  and
              described under ACTIONS.

       operand
              The  operand  specifies the logical relationship between conditions before the action to be taken.  Valid operands
              are listed and described under OPERANDS.

       condition
              A conditional expression consisting of a field, operator and value.  See CONDITIONS for more information.

       control
              The control specifies the action to be taken by the device upon receipt of the rule.  The basic actions are to add
              it to, or remove it from, the list of existing rules.  Valid controls are listed and described under CONTROLS.

       volatility
              The  volatility  specifies  the  effective lifetime of the rule.  Temoprary rules are stored in SDRAM and are lost
              then the device is reset.  Permanent rules are stored in NVRAM and are restored after the device is reset.   Valid
              volatilities are listed and described under VOLATILITY.

       device The  MAC  address  of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified on the command line.  If more
              than one address is specified then operations are performed on each  device  in  turn.   The  default  address  is
              &quot;local&quot;.  See DEVICES for more information.

ACTIONS
       Actions  indcate  the  disposition  of frames that match selection criteria.  They are expressed as discrete alphanumeric
       strings entered in upper, lower or mixed character case.  They are position sensitive.  Failure to enter a  known  action
       will results in an error message that lists permitted actions.

       CAP0,CAP1,CAP2,CAP3
              Assign a specific Channel Access Priority to frames.

       Drop,DropTX
              Do not forward frames over powerline.

       DropRX Do not forward frames to host.

       Boost  Boost frame priority to CAP3 for MMEs only.  At least one condition must be &quot;MME&quot;.

       StripTX
              Remove  the  VLAN Tag from frames before transmission over powerline.  This option checks for a VLAN Tag even when
              there are no VLAN related conditions.

       StripRX
              Remove the VLAN Tag from frames before forwarding to host.  This option checks for a VLAN Tag even when there  are
              no VLAN related conditions.

       TagTX  Insert a given VLAN Tag into frames before transmission over powerline.  This action requires option -T to specify
              the tag and option -V to specify the CSPEC version.

OPERANDS
       The operand indicates the logical relationship that must exist between conditions in the rule set before  the  action  is
       applied  to  a frame.  Operands are expressed as discrete alphanumeric strings entered in upper, lower or mixed character
       case.  Failure to enter a known operand will result in an error message that lists permitted operands.  They are  positon
       sensitive.  One operand is allowed and it must appear after the action and before any condition.

       Any    Apply the action to frames that satisfy any of the conditions.  This is equivalent to the logical or operation.

       All    Apply the action to frames that satisfy all of the conditions.  This is equivalent to the logical and operation.

       Always Apply the action to all frames.  All conditions are ignored.

CONDITIONS
       A  condition consists of a field, an operator and a value.  One condition is required but three are permitted.  Condition
       order is not important but all conditions must appear after the operand and before the control.

       field  The field is the part of the Ethernet frame to be examined.  Some fields are not valid for some actions  but  this
              program  does not enforce such rules since validation is performed by runtime firmware on each device.  Recognized
              fields are listed and described under FIELDS.

       operator
              The operator specifies the relationsip that must exist between the field and value in order for the  condition  to
              evaluate  True.  Currently, only equality operators are supported.  Valid operators are listed and described under
              OPERATORS.

       value  The value must be appropriate to the field type.  Some fields are MAC or IP addresses, some are integers, some are
              bitmaps  and  others  are states.  Integers and bitmaps may be expressed in binary, decimal or hexadecimal format.
              Binary values staRt with 0b.  Hexadecimal values start with 0x.  States are expressed using keywords.   Users  are
              responsible  for  knowing  how many bits are significant for each type of value.  Valid values are described along
              with fields under FIELDS.

FIELDS
       Fields indicate the portion of the frame that is inspected during selection and the size and format of the value permited
       in the condition statement.  They are expressed as discrete alphanumeric strings entered in upper, lower or mixed charac‐
       ter case.  Failure to enter a known field will result in an error message that lists permitted fields.

       ET     A 16-bit Ethertype expressed in hexadecimal with optional &quot;0x&quot; prefix.  The format is described in  IEEE  Standard
              802-2001 [4].

       EthDA  A  48-bit Ethernet destination address expressed in hexadecimal.  Octets may be separated with optional colons for
              clarity.  The format is described in IEEE Standard 802-2001 [4].

       EthSA  A 48-bit Ethernet source address expressed in hexadecimal.  Octets may be separated with optional colons for clar‐
              ity.  The format is described in IEEE Standard 802-2001 [4].

       IPSP   A  16-bit  IP  source  port  expressed as a decimal integer.  This condition applies to either TCP or UDP packets,
              depending on the protocol used, and is valid only for actions &quot;CAP0&quot;, &quot;CAP1&quot;, &quot;CAP2&quot;, &quot;CAP3&quot; and &quot;Drop&quot;.

       IPDP   A 16-bit IP destination port expressed as a decimal integer.  This condition applies to either TCP or UDP packets,
              depending on the protocol used, and is valid only for actions &quot;CAP0&quot;, &quot;CAP1&quot;, &quot;CAP2&quot;, &quot;CAP3&quot; and &quot;Drop&quot;.

       IPV4TOS
              An 8-bit Type-of-Service code where the format is defined in the RFC 791 (Internet Protocol) [14].

       IPV4PROT
              An 8-bit Ethernet protocol code.  The format is defined in the RFC 791 (Internet Protocol) [14].

       IPV4SA A 32-bit Internet Protocol source address expressed in dotted-decimal notation.  The official format is defined in
              RFC 791 (Internet Protocol) [14].  Our implementation permits empty octets and leading zeros within  fields.   For
              example, &quot;...&quot; is equivalent to &quot;0.0.0.0 and &quot;127..000.001&quot; is equivalent to &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;.

       IPV4DA A  32-bit  Internet  Protocol  destination  address  expressed  in dotted-decimal notation. The official format is
              defined in RFC 791 (internet Protocol) [14]. Our implementation permits empty  octets  and  leading  zeros  within
              fields. For example, &quot;...&quot; is equivalent to &quot;0.0.0.0 and &quot;127..000.001&quot; is equivalent to &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;.

       IPV6TC An 8-bit Internet Protocol V6 traffic class expressed as defined in RFC 2460 (Internet Protocol Version 6) [17].

       IPV6FL A  24-bit  IPV6  flow label where the lower 20 bits are the IPv6 Flow Label defined in RFC 2460 (Internat Protocol
              Version 6) [17].  The upper 4 bits should be zero.  The value can be entered either as a decimal,  binary  or  hex
              integer.

       IPV6SA A  128-bit IPV6 source address expressed as colon-separated hexadecmial quartets (octet pairs).  The official for‐
              mat is defined in RFC 2460 (Internet Protocol Version 6) [17].  Our implementation permits multiple empty  fields,
              abreviated  fields  and  leading zeros within fields.  When multiple empty fields appear, the right-most occurance
              expands     to     multiple     zeros.      For     example,     &quot;AAAA::BBBB::CCCC&quot;     is      equivalent      to
              &quot;AAAA:0000:BBBB:0000:0000:0000:0000:CCCC&quot;.

       IPV6DA A  128-bit IPV6 destination address expressed as colon-separated hexadecimal quartets (octet pairs).  The official
              format is defined in RFC 2460 (Internet Protocol Version 6)  [17].   Our  implementation  permits  multiple  empty
              fields,  abbreviated  fields  and  leading zeros within fields.  When multiple empty fields appear, the right-most
              occurance expands to zeros.  For example, &quot;:1::2&quot; is equivalent to &quot;0000:0001:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0002&quot;.

       MME    A 24-bit Atheros HomePlugAV Management Message type expressed as a hex byte stream.  For clarity,  the  recommeded
              format  it  &quot;xx:xxxx&quot;.   The  first  byte is the MMV.  The next two bytes are the MMTYPE.  Both are defined in the
              HomePlug AV Specification.  The MMTYPE will match all  MME  variants,  such  as  Request,  Confirm,  Indicate  and
              Response because the lower two bits are ignored.  This field is only valid for action &quot;Boost&quot;.

       TCPAck The  string  &quot;True&quot;  or &quot;False&quot; to indicate that the frame is (or is not) a TCP Acknowledgement.  Double negatives
              are allowed so &quot;Is True&quot; is equvalent to &quot;Not False&quot; and &quot;Is False&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Not True&quot;.

       TCPSP  A 16-bit TCP source port as a decimal integer.  The format is defined in RFC 793  (Transmission  Control  Protocol
              [15]).

       TCPDP  A 16-bit TCP destination port expressed as a decimal integer.  The format is defined in RFC 793 (Transmission Con‐
              trol Protocol [15]).

       UDPSP  A 16-bit UDP source port expressed as a decimal integer.  The format is defined in RFC 768 (User Datagram Protocol
              [13]).

       UDPDP  A  16-bit  UDP  destination  port expressed as a decimal integer.  The format is defined in RFC 768 (User Datagram
              Protocol [13]).

       VLANID A 16-bit VLAN identifier where the lower 12 bits are the VLAN Identifier (VID) defined  in  IEEE  Std  802.1Q-1998
              (Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks) [11].  The upper 4 bits should be zero.

       VLANUP An  8-bit  Ethernet  VLAN tag where the lower 3 bits are the User Priority sub-field of a VLAN Tag defined in IEEE
              Std 802.1Q-1998 (Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks) [11].  The upper 5 bits should be zero.

       VLANTag
              The string &quot;Present&quot; or &quot;Missing&quot; to indicate the presence (or absence) of one or more VLAN Tags within  a  frame.
              This  classifier  is  essentially  equivalent  to &quot;ET Is 0x8100&quot;.  Double negatives are allowed so &quot;Is Present&quot; is
              equivalent to &quot;Not Missing&quot; and &quot;Is Missing&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Not Present&quot;.

OPERATORS
       An operator indicates an equality between a field and a value.  An operator is an alphanumeric string entered  in  upper,
       lower  or  mixed  character case.  Failure to enter a known operator will result in an error message that lists permitted
       operators.  Operators are position sensitive and must appear between each field and value.

       Is     Indicates that the frame field must equal the associated value for the condition to evaluate true.

       Not    Indicates that the frame field must not equal the associated value for the condition to evaluate true.

STATES
       A state is a special case of value.

       True,On,Yes,Present
              Indicates a positive state or presence of some entity.  All are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.   Dou‐
              ble negatives are permitted so &quot;Is True&quot; is equvalent to &quot;Not False&quot;.

       False,Off,No,Missing
              Indicates a negative state or absence of some entity.  All are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.  Double
              negatives are permitted so &quot;Is False&quot; is equvalent to &quot;Not True&quot;.

CONTROLS
       The control determines how the devices will handle the rule after it  is  validated.   It  is  expressed  as  a  discrete
       alphanumeric  string entered in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Failure to enter a known control will result in an
       error message that lists permitted controls.  The control is position sensitive and must occur after condition and before
       volatility.

       Add    Adds the rule to the current list of rules unless a violation occurs.  In some cases, a rule may replace an exist‐
              ing rule instead of being added.

       Rem,Remove
              Remove the rule from the current list of rules unless a violation occurs.

VOLATILITY
       The volatility determines which device rule set will be affected by the action.  It is expressed as a  discrete  alphanu‐
       meric  string  entered  in  upper,  lower or mixed character case.  Failure to enter a known volatility will result in an
       error message that lists permitted volatilities.  The volatility is position sensitive and must occur after control.

       Temp   The temporary rule set will be modified.  The temporary rule set resides in the working PIB stored in SDRAM.

       Perm   The permanent rule set will be modified.  The permanent rule set resides in the user PIB stored in NVRAM.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12  hex‐
       adecimal  digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local,  remote  or  foreign
              recognize  messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.   All  local
              Atheros  devices  recognize  this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is any device at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

EXAMPLES
       This command adds a temporary classification rule to the classification table on  device  B00:B0:52:BA:BE:01.   The  rule
       instructs  the device to drop frames that match either (any) of two conditions.  The first condition states that the IPv4
       source address is 192.168.99.2.  The second conditon states that the IPv4 destination address is 192.168.99.100.

          # plcrule drop any IPv4SA is 192.168.99.2 IPv4DA is 192.168.99.100 add temp 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01

       Observe that the action, operand and conditions come first then the control and volatility then the affected devices.  Up
       to three conditions may be specified.  Keyword order is important.  Character case is not important.

       The  following  example  prints  a  list of programmed keywords on stdout for reference.  The example shown here has been
       abbreviate due to formatting limitations.

          # plcrule -t

            Controls are ’Add’|’Rem’|’Remove’
            Volatilities are ’Temp’|’Perm’
            Actions are ’CAP0’|’CAP1’|’CAP2’|’CAP3’|’Boost’|...|’StripTX’|’StripRX’|’TagRX’
            Operands are ’All’|’Any’|’Always’
            Fields are ’EthDA’|’EthSA’|’VLANUP’|’VLANID’|’IPv4TOS’|...|’TCPAck’|’VLANTag’
            Operators are ’Is’|’Not’

       More example follow:

       Ethernet Address Rules

       Ethernet address rules have the following general format:

          | CAP0 | ANY | EthSA | IS  | xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx | ADD    | TEMP | xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
          | CAP1 | ALL | EthDA | NOT |                   | REMOVE | PERM |
          | CAP2 |
          | CAP3 |
          | DROP |

       For example, instruct device 00:B0:52:BA:BE:FF to temporarily add a rule to  forward  frames  from  00:2B:FE:CA:FE:BA  at
       CAP3.  Observe Ethernet hardware addresses are used both in the condition and for the affected powerline devices.

          # plcrule cap3 any ethsa is 00:2b:fe:ca:fe:ba add temp 00:b0;52:ba:be:ff

       IP Address Rules

       IP address rules have the following general format:

          | CAP0 | ANY | IPv4SA | IS  | ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd | ADD    | TEMP | xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
          | CAP1 | ALL | IPv4DA | NOT |                 | REMOVE | PERM |
          | CAP2 |
          | CAP3 |
          | DROP |

       For  example,  instruct  device  00:B0:52:BA:BE:FF  to  permanently remove the rule that drops packets from 192.168.99.1.
       Notice that the IP address is specified in dotted decimal format but the device address is specified in hexadecimal octet
       format.   Dotted decimal format permits empty and variable length octets but octet delimiters are mandatory.  Hexadecimal
       octet format requires fixed length octets but octet delimiters are optional.

          # plcrule drop any ipv4sa is 192.168.99.1 remove perm 00:b0:52:ba:be:ff

       IP Protocol Rules

       IP protocol rules have the following general format:

          | CAP0 | ANY | IPv4PROT | IS  | xxxx | ADD    | TEMP | xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
          | CAP1 | ALL |          | NOT |      | REMOVE | PERM |
          | CAP2 |
          | CAP3 |
          | DROP |

       For example, to instruct device 00:B0:52:BA:BE:FF to permanently add a rule to forward non-IP packets at CAP2.   In  this
       example, delmiters have been omitted from the device Ethernet address.

          # plcrule CAP2 all ipv4prot not 0x0800 add perm 00b052babeff
