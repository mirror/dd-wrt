plchostd(1)                                  Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                 plchostd(1)

NAME
       plchostd - Qualcomm Atheros PLC Host Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       plchostd [options] -N nvmfile -P pibfile

DESCRIPTION
       Wait  for  VS_HST_ACTION.IND  messages from a local device and service them as described in the Qualcomm Atheros Firmware
       Technical Reference Manual for powerline devices.  Unlike programs int6khost and int64host, this program  uses  operating
       system features available on POSIX, Unix, BSD and Linux systems but not available on Microsoft or VxWorks systems.

       To  use  the program, connect a flash-less device to the host via ethernet then start this program with the correct file‐
       names.  The program will automatically respond to device requests  to  download  memory  configuration,  firmware  and/or
       parameters  and  upload  firmware or and/or parameters under device control.  See the Qualcomm Atheros Firmware Technical
       Reference Manual for more information.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this interface and only reponses received via this
              interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their  principle  network
              connection;  however,  if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.
              This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -N nvmfile
              The file containing the firmware chain used to boot and flash the device.  The file must exist and  have  a  valid
              NVM file format or it will be rejected.  No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are
              enforced.  The program will not over-write this file.  This option and argument are required.

       -n filename
              Use this file to store firmware uploaded from the local device.  The file need not exist but an error  will  occur
              if  it  cannot  be  created  or written.  If firmware is uploaded to this file, it is used for subsequent firmware
              downloads unless the device requests a factory reset.  In that case, the file specified  by  option  -N  is  used.
              This option and argument are optional.  If omitted then the default filename host.pib will be used.

       -P pibfile
              The  file  containing the parameter chain used to boot and flash the device.  The file must exist and have a valid
              PIB file format or it will be rejected.  No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are
              enforced.  The program will not over-write this file.  This option and argument are required.

       -p filename
              Use this file to store parameters uploaded from the local device.  The file need not exist but an error will occur
              if it cannot be created or written.  Once parameters are uploaded to this file, it is used for subsequent  parame‐
              ter  downloads unless the device requests a factory reset.  In that case, the file specified by option -P is used.
              This option and argument are optional.  If omitted then the default filename host.nvm will be used.

       -q     Suppress status messages on stderr.

       -s pathname
              The server socket pathname.  Automatically open this Unix socket and post event information to it for the  benefit
              of other host processes.

       -S filename
              The file containing the softloader chain used to flash the device.  The presence of this file causes the device to
              be flashed once it has booted.  The file must exist and have a valid PIB file format or it will be  rejected.   No
              assumptions  are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.  The program will not over-write
              this file.  This option and argument are required.

       -t timeout
              Read timeout in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is  the  maximum  time  allowed  for  a
              response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -v     Print  additional  information  on  stdout.   In particular, this option will print incoming and outgoing Ethernet
              frames on stdout.

       -w wakeup
              Wakeup time in seconds.  If no VS_HST_ACTION.IND message is received within this time period then the process will
              wakeup  and perform periodic functions such as posting network topography to the server socket specified by option
              -s.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       None.

EXAMPLES
       The following example starts the host server.  The -N and -P options are always required.  Option order is not important.
       Control  does  not return to the console until the program is terminated by the user using CTRL-C or another command line
       interrupt.

          # plchostd -N test.nvm -P test.pib -n temp.nvm -p temp.pib

       The next example does the same but spawns the program as an independent process and returns control to the  console.   In
       this case, that process must be terminated or killed using an appropriate command such ad kill.

          # plchostd -N test.nvm -P test.pib -n temp.nvm -p temp.pib -d
