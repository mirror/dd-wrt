getpib(1)                                    Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                   getpib(1)

NAME
       getpib - Qualcomm Atheros PIB Data Extractor

SYNOPSIS
       getpib file offset format [length]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program is a companion to program setpib and is designed to support shell scripts.  It extracts PIB file parameters
       so that a scripting language can evaluate, manipulate or store them with minimal effort.  Good scripting skills and  some
       imagination may be required to make effective use of this program.

       Users having a detailed knowledge of PIB content and structure can make extremely effective use of this program; however,
       Atheros is under no obligation to provide customers with the offset, length or format of PIB file parameters.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       - c character
              The appended character.  Append this character each line of output instead of newline.  Use this to create a comma
              separated list of value, for example, by specifying a comma.

       -n     Append a newline to the output.

       -q     Enable quiet mode which has no effect.

       -v     Verbose mode.  Does nothing.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Usethis  option  when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The PIB filename.  This argument is required and must appear first on the command line.  No assumptions  are  made
              based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced; however, an invalid PIB file will be rejected.

       offset The  data  offset  in  bytes expressed in hexadecimal.  This argument is required and must follow the filename.  A
              leading &quot;0x&quot; prefix is optional.  The data offset plus the data length cannot exceed the file extent.

       format The output format.  This argument is required and must follow the offset.  Some formats imply fixed  data  length.
              Others formats are for variable length data.  The fixed data formats are byte, word, long, hfid, mac and key.  The
              variable data formats are data and text.  The formats are described in the next section.

       length The data length in bytes expressed in decimal.  This argument is only required for the the data formats  data  and
              text.  The data offset plus the data length cannot exceed the file extent.  The data length cannot exceed 1024.

FORMATS
       byte   Extract  1  byte  and  display it as an unsigned decimal integer value.  The offset advances  byte before starting
              another extraction.

       word   Extract 2 consecutive bytes and display them as an unsigned decimal integer value after  endian  conversion.   The
              offset advances  bytes before starting another extraction.

       long   Extract  4  consecutive  bytes and display them as an unsigned decimal integer value after endian conversion.  The
              offset advances 4 bytes before starting another extraction.

       huge   Extract 8 consecutive bytes and display them as an unsigned decimal integer value after  endian  conversion.   The
              offset advances 8 bytes before starting another extraction.

       xbyte  Extract  1  byte and display it as a hexadecimal integer value.  The offset advances  byte before starting another
              extraction.

       xword  Extract 2 consecutive bytes and display them as a hexadecimal integer value after endian conversion.   The  offset
              advances  bytes before starting another extraction.

       xlong  Extract  4  consecutive bytes and display them as a hexadecimal integer value after endian conversion.  The offset
              advances 4 bytes before starting another extraction.

       xhuge  Extract 8 consecutive bytes and display them as a hexadecimal integer value after endian conversion.   The  offset
              advances 8 bytes before starting another extraction.

       data length
              Extract  the  specified  number  of bytes and display them as a hexadecimal string with no punctuation to separate
              octets.  The offset advances length bytes before starting another extraction.  The minimum length is 1.  The maxi‐
              mum length is 1024.

       mac    Extract  6  bytes  and  display  them as a colon-separated hexadecimal string.  The offset advances 6 bytes before
              starting another extraction.  This is similar to &quot;data 6&quot; but colons separate each octet.

       key    Extract 16 bytes and display them as a colon-separated hexadecimal string.  The offset advances  16  bytes  before
              starting another extraction.  This is similar to &quot;data 16&quot; but colons separate each octet.

       hfid   Extract  64 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-printable char‐
              acter.  The offset advances 64 bytes before starting another extraction.  This is equivalent to &quot;text 64&quot;.

       skip length
              Advance the specified number of bytes without displaying anything.  The offset advances  by  length  bytes  before
              starting another extraction.  The minimum length is 1.  The maximum length is 1024.

       text length
              Extract  the specified number of bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-print‐
              able character.  The offset advances the specified number of bytes before starting another extraction.

TR-069
       accesspassword
              Extract 65 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-printable  char‐
              acter.   The offset advances 65 bytes before starting another extraction.  This format is equivalent to &quot;text 65&quot;.

       accessusername
              Extract 33 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-printable  char‐
              acter.   The offset advances 33 bytes before starting another extraction.  This format is equivalent to &quot;text 33&quot;.

       adminpassword
              Extract 33 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-printable  char‐
              acter.   The offset advances 33 bytes before starting another extraction.  This format is equivalent to &quot;text 33&quot;.

       adminusername
              Extract 33 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-printable  char‐
              acter.   The offset advances 33 bytes before starting another extraction.  This format is equivalent to &quot;text 33&quot;.

       password
              Extract 257 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-printable char‐
              acter.   The  offset  advances  257  bytes before starting another extraction.  This format is equivalent to &quot;text
              257&quot;.

       url    Extract 257 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-printable char‐
              acter.   The  offset  advances  257  bytes before starting another extraction.  This format is equivalent to &quot;text
              257&quot;.

       username
              Extract 257 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-printable char‐
              acter.   The  offset  advances  257  bytes before starting another extraction.  This format is equivalent to &quot;text
              257&quot;.

EXAMPLES
       The following example extracts one byte from offset 01F7 of PIB file abc.pib and displays it as an unsigned decimal inte‐
       ger  string.   No  length specification is needed because the byte format has an implied length of 1 byte.  The displayed
       value is 232 because the byte format is decimal.  We could have specified &quot;data 1&quot; to display the  byte  in  hexadecimal.
       The return prompt appears on the display line because option -n was omitted.

          # getpib abc.pib 01F7 byte
          232#

       The  next  example  extracts two bytes at offset 01F7 and displays them as a hexadecimal string.  A length of 2 is needed
       because the data format is variable length.  We could have specified &quot;word&quot; to display these bytes as an unsigned decimal
       integer  string.   The hexadecimal string consists two octets E8 and 8A.  The first byte is the same one extracted in the
       last example.  The return prompt appears on a new line because option -n was present.

          # getpib abc.pib 01F7 data 2 -n
          E88A
          #
