int6k(1)                                     Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                    int6k(1)

NAME
       int6k - Qualcomm Atheros INT6x00 Powerline Device Manager

SYNOPSIS
       int6k [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  version of the Qualcomm Atheros Device Manager for Linux performs basic operations on Atheros INT6x00 devices using
       the raw Ethernet protocol described in the Qualcomm Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual.  It  can  be
       used to interrogate and control devices or upgrade firmware if on-board NVRAM is present.

       This  program  is  part  of  the  Qualcomm  Atheros  Powerline Toolkit.  Is supports legacy chipsets INT6000, INT6300 and
       INT6400.  See program amptool for AR7400 and AR7450 chipsets.  See program  plctool  for  QCA6410,  QCA7000  and  QCA7420
       chipsets.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -a     Read  device  attributes  using  VS_OP_ATTRIBUTES.  Attributes are short strings and integers that describe device
              hardware and firmware.  They are concatenated to form the output that is similar to option -r but derived  differ‐
              ently.

       -B action
              Press  the  simple  connect  pushbutton using VS_PB_ENC.  The action can be specified by number 1, 2, 3 or 4 or by
              symbol &quot;join&quot;, &quot;leave&quot;, &quot;status&quot; or &quot;reset&quot;, respectively.  Use 1 on both devices that are expected to join.   Use
              2 only on the device that is expected to leave the network.

       -C module
              Commit  (flash)  downloaded modules to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM.  The module can be spedified by number 1, 2 or 3 or
              by symbol &quot;nvm&quot;, &quot;pib&quot; or &quot;both&quot;, repectively.  Module 3 is equivalent to option -F which writes the NVM  and  PIB
              together.  You cannot force flash NVRAM using this option.  Use option -FF to force flash.

       -d filename
              Read  Watchdog Report from the device and write it to the named file in binary format using VS_WD_RPT.  The report
              file can be sent to Qualcomm Atheros for technical analysis.  No assumptions are made based  on  filename  and  no
              filename convetions are enforced; however, you should use a .log file extension to indicate binary format.

       -D xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              Define  the  16 octet Device Access Key (DAK) in hex format.  The DAK is used by option -J.  It may also be set to
              &quot;key1&quot; or &quot;key2&quot; as explained in the KEYS section.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -f     Read  device  NVRAM parameters using VS_GET_NVM.  An error will be reported when no NVRAM is present.  This option
              can be used to determine if NVRAM is large enough to store the runtime firmware and parameter block.

       -F[F]  Write previously downloaded MAC and PIB to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM.  Adding a second F here or another -F  anywhere
              on  the  command  line  will force-flash a blank or corrupted NVRAM.  Firmware loaded from NVRAM will treat force-
              flash as an error.  This option can be used to create factory settings but cannot be used to change them once cre‐
              ated.   Subsequent  use  creates  and updates operational settings that can be erased using a factory reset.  This
              option is executed after all others on the command line, except for the -R option.

       -g     Read multicast group information discovered while IGMP snooping using VS_MULTICAST_INFO.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received  via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network connection; however, if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it  takes  precedence  over  the  default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -I     Read  the  device PIB header using VS_RD_MOD and print the firmware major revision number, PIB minor revision num‐
              ber, Device Access Key (DAK), Network Membership Key (NMK), MAC address and other information on stdout.

       -J xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              Set the Network Membership Key (NMK) on the remote device, specified by MAC, using  VS_SET_KEY.   This  option  is
              similar  to  option  -K  but  requires  the  remote device MAC and DAK in addition to the NMK and local device MAC
              address.  The NMK value is defined using option -K unless you want to use the default value.  The  remote  DAK  is
              defined  using option -D unless you want to use the default value.  Programming remote device keys is complicated.
              It is often easier to connect the device directly to the host and use the -K option.

       -K xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              Define the Network Membership Key (NMK) value used by options -M or -J.  The symbolic names &quot;key1&quot; and &quot;key2&quot;  are
              recognized as described in the KEY section.

       -l count
              Define the number of times that the command will be repeated for each device specified.  Normally, you will repeat
              operations on one device only.

       -m     Read network membership information using VS_NW_INFO.  This can be used to determine network configuration.

       -M     Set the Network Membership Key (NMK) on the local device using VS_SET_KEY.  The NMK value is specified  using  the
              -K option unless you want to use the default value.

       -n filename
              Read  firmware  from  the  device SDRAM and write it to the named .nvm file using multiple VS_RD_MOD messages.  No
              assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.  This option is performed  before
              option -N when both are specified.

       -N filename
              Read  the  named  .nvm file and write it to the device using multiple VS_WR_MOD messages.  No assumptions are made
              based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced; however, files having  invalid  .nvm  format  will  be
              rejected.  This option is executed after -n when both are specified.

       -p filename
              Read parameters from the device SDRAM and write them to the named .pib file using multiple VS_RD_MOD messages.  No
              assumptions are made based on filename and no filename convetions are enforced.  This option  is  executed  before
              option BP when both are specified.

       -P filename
              Read  the  named  .pib file and write it to the device using multiple VS_WR_MOD messages.  No assumptions are made
              based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced; however, files having  invalid  .pib  format  will  be
              rejected.  This option is executed after -p when both are specified.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -Q     Quick  flash.  The program will not wait for a device to reset or the firmware to restart after writing flash mem‐
              ory.  This option is desirable with newer firmware that writes flash memory in the background.  It has  no  effect
              unless used with option -F or -C.

       -r     Read device firmware and hardware revision using VS_SW_VER.  Output is similar to option -a but is derived differ‐
              ently.

       -R     Reset the device using VS_RS_DEV.  This option is executed after all others on the same command line.

       -s     Read device SDRAM configuration using VS_RD_CBLOCK.

       -S filename
              Read the named .cfg file and write it to the device using VS_SET_SDRAM.  No assumptions are made based on filename
              and  no filename conventions are enforced; however, files having an invalid .cfg file format will be rejected.  Do
              not confuse .cfg files with .config files.  See chkcfg and config2cfg for more information on SDRAM  configuration
              file formats.

       -t milliseconds
              Read  timeout  in  milliseconds.   Values  range  from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is the maximum time allowed for a
              response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -T     Restore factory defaults.  This permanently erases all PIB changes made since the device was last programmed  with
              factory default settings.  The device will automatically reset and reboot.

       -v     Print  additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets which can
              be saved as text files for reference.

       -w seconds
              Defines the number of seconds to wait before repeating command line options.  This option  has  no  effect  unless
              option -l is also specified with a non-zero value.

       -x     Cause  the  program  to  exit  on  the  first error instead of continuing with remaining iterations, operations or
              devices.  Normally, the program reports errors and moves on to the next operation, iteration or  device  depending
              on the command line.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  Ethernet  hardware  address  of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified on the command
              line.  If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in  turn.   The  default
              address is local.  as explained in the DEVICES section.

KEYS
       Passwords are variable length character strings that end-users can remember.  Keys are fixed length binary values created
       by encrypting passwords.  There are two encryption algorithms for HomePlugAV.  One for DAKs and the other for NMKs.  This
       means that a given password will produce different keys depending on use.  This program only deals with keys because that
       is what powerline devices recognize.  The passwords that generated the keys are irrelevant here.

       Encryption keys are tedious to type and prone to error.  For convenience, symbolic names have  been  assigned  to  common
       encryption keys and are recognized by options -D and -K.

       key1   Key   for  encrypted  password  &quot;HomePlugAV&quot;.   This  is  &quot;689F074B8B0275A2710B0B5779AD1630&quot;  for  option  -D  and
              &quot;50D3E4933F855B7040784DF815AA8DB7&quot; for option -K.

       key2   Key for encrypted password  &quot;HomePlugAV0123&quot;.   This  is  &quot;F084B4E8F6069FF1300C9BDB812367FF&quot;  for  option  -D  and
              &quot;B59319D7E8157BA001B018669CCEE30D&quot; for option -K.

       none   Always &quot;00000000000000000000000000000000&quot;.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices  use Ethernet hardware, or Media Access Control (MAC), addresses.  Device addresses are 12 hexadecimal
       digits (0123456789ABCDEFabcdef) in upper, lower or mixed case.  Individual octets may be separated by colons,  for  clar‐
       ity,  but  not all octets need to be seperated.  For example, &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are
       valid and equivalent.

       These symbolic addresses are recognized by this program and may be used instead of the actual address value.

       all    Equivalent to &quot;broadcast&quot;, described next.

       broadcast
              The Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local, remote or foreign will respond  to
              this address.

       local  The  Atheros  Local  Management  Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.  Local Atheros powerline devices recognize this
              address but remote and foreign powerline devices do not.  A remote device is any poserline device at the  far  end
              of the powerline.  A foreign device is a powerline device not manufactured by Atheros.

EXAMPLES
          # int6k -n old.nvm -p old.pib -N new.nvm -P new.pib -F 01:23:45:67:89:AB

       Performs  5  operations on one device.  Uploads the firmware and PIB from the device and writes them to files old.nvm and
       old.pib, respectively.  Reads files new.nvm and new.pib and downloads them as new firmware and PIB,  respectively.   Com‐
       mits  the  downloaded  firmware  and PIB to NVRAM.  Operations are executed in the order just described regardless of the
       order specified on the command line.  If you want reading and writing to occur in a different order then you must use two
       or more commands to accomplish tasks in the order you want.

          # int6k -N new.nvm 01:23:45:67:89:28
          # int6k -P new.pib 01:23:45:67:89:28
          # int6k -C 3 01:23:45:67:89:28

       It  is  not  neccessary  to specify all operations on one command line.  The three command lines above do essentially the
       same thing as the command line shown in the previou example.  Notice that this example uses -C 3, instead of  -F,  as  an
       alternate  way  to write MAC and PIB to NVRAM.  Specifying -C 1, instead, would write the .nvm file only.  Specifying, -C
       2, instead, would write the .pib file only.  The value 3 is the logical OR of 1 and 2.

          # int6k -N new.nvm -P new.pib -FF local

       Downloads file new.nvm and file new.pib and force flashes the  local  device.   Force  flashing  only  works  on  running
       firmware that has been downloaded and stated by the Qualcomm Atheros Boot Loader.  See int6kf to download, start firmware
       and perform a force flash in one operation.

          # int6k -MK key1
          # int6k -M

       These two commands are equivalent.  They set the NMK on the local device to key1 as descripted in the KEYS section.   The
       first  command  resets  the NMK on the local device with -M then specifies the NMK as key1.  The second command omits the
       key specification since key1 is the program default NMK.  One could, of course, type the encryption key.
