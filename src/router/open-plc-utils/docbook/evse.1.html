evse(1)                                      Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                     evse(1)

NAME
       evse - Qualcomm Atheros Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment Emulator

SYNOPSIS
       evse [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Emulate  the  EVSE  part  of  the HomePlug AV Signal Level Attentuation Characterization (SLAC) protocol where a PEV is a
       &quot;Plug-in Electric Vehicle&quot; and an EVSE is an &quot;Electric Vehicle Supply  Equipment&quot;  or  charging  station.   This  program
       remains active until terminated by the user.  It waits for some PEV-HLE on the powerline network to attempt to connect in
       order to charge a virtual vehicle then services the PEV-HLE until the PEV-HLE elects to connect, elects not to connect or
       abandons  the  attempt.  See the HomePlug Green PHY Specification Release Version 1.1 for more information on this proto‚Äê
       col.

       Signal Level Attenuation Characterization (SLAC) enables a station to measure the signal level  of  its  transmission  at
       other  stations  in  the  network.   It  is designed for automotive applications where there are multiple plug-in vehicle
       (PEVs) and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) on the network.  The PEV signal level is measured at  multiple  EVSEs
       to determine which EVSE the PEV is actually plugged into.  The process leading to this determination is called &quot;Green PHY
       PEV-EVSE Association&quot; (GreenPPEA).

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -c     Print  the  EVSE-HLE  configuration  profile on stdout.  The configuration profile specifies program defaults in a
              format that you, as a user, can edit and save.  Use options -p and -s to read named profiles and sections.

       -d     Print the contents of the EVSE-HLE session variable on stdout.  The session variable is an program data  structure
              that  stores  information passed between the PEV-HLE and EVSE-HLE during SLAC association.  This option is used to
              inspect and veriify information relevant to the process.

       If the program was compiled with variable SLAC_DEBUG defined then this option also prints MME message fields before  mes‚Äê
       sages are sent or after they are received.  Interested parties can follow along in the source code.

       -i     Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -p profile
              The EVSE-HLE configuration profile name.  The program will supply default values  for  missing  profile  elements.
              See the example profile shown below.  The default profile is &quot;evse.ini&quot;.

       -q     Enter quiet mode.  Progress messages are suppressed.

       -s section
              The  configuration profile section name.  The program will supply default values for missing configuration profile
              elements.  See the example profile shown below.  The default section name is &quot;default&quot;.

       -v     Enter verbose mode.  All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program are displayed on stdout.

       -w milliseconds
              Wakeup frequency in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  The default is 5000 milliseconds  (or  5
              seconds).

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

PROFILE
       The  default  configuration profile for this program is &quot;evse.ini&quot;.  The default profile section is &quot;default&quot;.  Users may
       create addition profiles and reference them with option -p or add additional sections to an existing profiles and  refer‚Ä‚Äê
       ence them with option -s.

       Time to Sound
              The time in 100 millisecond increments for all msounds to arrive at the msound target.  The msound target may pro‚Äê
              ceed with attenuation characterization computations should all msounds fail to arrive within  this  period.   This
              value  is read but not used by program pev or program evse.  This value is the same as CM_SLAC_PARAM.CNF.TIME_OUT.
              The default value is 10 which represents 1000 milliseconds.

       Number of Sounds

       The total number of msounds that will be sent to the msound target.
              All msounds  must  arrive  within  the  allotted  time  or  they  will  be  lost.   This  value  is  the  same  as
              CM_SLAC_PARAM.CNF.NUM_SOUNDS.  The default is 8.

       Response Type
              Controls  whether  the  msound  recipient  sends signal attenuation characteristic profile data to the EVSE-HLE or
              another station.  The only response specified at this time is the EVSE-HLE.  The default value is  0.   Any  other
              value is ignored.

       Station Identifier
              Vehicle  identification.   The  17-byte  Vehicle Identification Number to be placed in CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND.SenderID.
              This value is not used but is can be changed here so that the field is easy to spot within network message traces.

       Network Membership Key
              The 16-byte Network Memberhip Key (NMK) for the PEV-PLC device.  This program uses CM_SET_KEY to sets the EVSE-PLC
              NMK to this value after disconnecting.  The default value is the key for Network Password &quot;HomePlugAV0123&quot;.

       Network Identifier
              The 7-byte Network Identifier (NID) for the PEV-PLC device.  This program uses CM_SET_KEY to sets the EVSE-PLC NID
              to this value after disconnecting.  The default value is the same as that for Network Password &quot;HomePlugAV0123&quot;.

EXAMPLES
       The following example starts a EVSE session on interface eth0 and wait up to 2000 milliseconds (or 2 seconds) for the PEV
       to respond during any given exchange.

          # evse -ieth0 -w2000

       The default EVSE-HLE configuration profile, &quot;evse.ini&quot;, looks something like this but it can be changed  using  a  normal
       text editor.  Use option -P to produce a template profile, if one is needed.

          # file: evse.ini
          # ====================================================================
          # EVSE-HLE initiaization;
          # --------------------------------------------------------------------
          [default]
          time to sound = 10
          number of sounds = 8
          response type = 0
          station identifier = BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
          network membership key = B59319D7E8157BA001B018669CCEE30D
          network identifier = 026BCBA5354E08
