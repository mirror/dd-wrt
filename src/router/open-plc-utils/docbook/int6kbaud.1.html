int6kbaud(1)                                 Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                int6kbaud(1)

NAME
       int6kbaud - Qualcomm Atheros Serial Line Device Configuration

SYNOPSIS
       int6kbaud [options] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Set serial line parameters on a UART-enabled Atheros powerline device using the ATBR serial line command.

       Serial  line  commands  are  7-bit  ASCII character strings sent to the local powerline device over the host serial port.
       They can be sent using any terminal emulator but this program will, in many cases, reduce typing and simplify  scripting.
       It is especially useful for downloading device parameters and uploading device parameters or firmware because those oper‐
       ations involve large volumes of data.  Also, this program permits decimal integer  arguments  in  many  cases  where  the
       serial  line  commands require hexadecimal integer values.  See the COMMANDS section below for a list of supported serial
       line commands;

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

COMMENTS
       This program does not configure or reconfigure host serial port settings since most systems provide a utility to do that.
       Be sure to configure them before using this program since other programs may change them before or  after  use.   Atheros
       factory  default  settings for UART-enabled powerline devices are 1115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity and no
       flow control.

       On Linux, use the stty utility to inspect and set serial port parameters.  The following  Linux  command  will  configure
       serial  device  /dev/ttyS0 speed to 115200 baud with 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity bit and no flow control.  Consult
       the stty man page for an explanation of these and other options.

          #stty -f /dev/ttyS0 115200 cs8 cstopb -cparenb -ixon

       On Windows, use the the Device Manager dialog to set serial Port properties.  To open this  dialog,  select  Start  Menu,
       Control Panel, System, Hardware, Device Manager, Ports, Advanced.

OPTIONS
       -B baudrate
              The new baud rate.  Any integer value may be entered here but only certain values may be accepted by the powerline
              device.  Although the device may support some value, the local host may not support it.  Supported values are 300,
              600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800 and 921600.  The default is 115200.

       -D databits
              The number of bits per data byte.  Accepted values are 7 and 8.  The default is 8.

       -F flowctrl
              The hardware flowcontrol state.  Accepted values are 0=off and 1=on where numeric values or keywords &quot;off&quot; or &quot;on&quot;
              may be used.  Keyword &quot;none&quot; is synonymous with &quot;off&quot; for this option.  The default is none.

       -m mode
              Accepted values are 1=transparent and 2=command where numeric values or keywords &quot;transparent&quot; or &quot;command&quot; may be
              used.

       -P parity
              The  number  of parity bits and parity mode.  Accepted values are 0=none, 1=odd and 2=even where numeric values of
              keywords &quot;none&quot;, &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;even&quot; may be used.  The default is none.

       -q     Suppress progress and error information on stderr.

       -s tty Communicate with the local powerline device over the named serial  interface  on  the  local  host.   The  program
              default is &quot;/dev/ttyUSB0&quot; for Linux and &quot;com1:&quot; for Windows.  The program default may be replace by defining envi‐
              ronment variable PLCUART.  This command line option will over-ride those defaults.

       -S stopbits
              The number of stop bits.  Accepted values are 1 or 2.  The default is 1.

       -u     Force default host port settings to match the default setting for UART-enabled  Atheros  powerline  devices.   The
              setting  are  115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity bits and 1 stop bit.  These settings will remain active when the
              program terminates and will not change unless changed by some other means, perhaps by another  application.   This
              option  is  an easy means of establishg an initial serial connection with a powerline device, unless it’s settings
              have been changed.

       -v     Display serial line commands and responses on stdout.

       -w     Place the local powerline device in Command Mode using the +++ serial line command. The device will remain in com‐
              mand mode until it is reset or forced into Transparaent Mode or High Speed Command Mode.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print  program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       None.

COMMANDS
       This  section  lists  serial  line  commands  recognized by local powerline devices when in Command Mode. Commands can be
       issued interactively using a terminal emulator, like minicom on Linux or HyperTerminal on Windows or stored as  text  and
       copied to the serial port using system utilities, like cat on Linux or type on Windows. This program merely converts com‐
       mand line options and arguments into one or more of the serial line commands shown below.

       +++    Exit Transparent Mode and enter Command Mode. See option -w above.

       AT     Test for Command Mode by doing nothing, successfully. See option -t above.

       ATBRmode,baudrate,databits,parity,stopbits,flowctrl
              Set serial line parameters on the local powerline device. Beware that this will break the existing serial  connec‐
              tion when the new parameters differ from those of the local host.

       ATBSZ? Get Transparent Mode buffer size. See option -z above.

       ATBSZsize
              Set Transparent Mode buffer size. See option -Z above.

       ATDST? Get Transparent Mode destination device address. See option -d above.

       ATDSTaddress
              Set Transparent Mode destination device address. See option -D above.

       ATFD   Reset local device to factory defaults. See option -T above.

       ATHSC  Exit  Command Mode and enter High Speed Command Mode. Once the OK response is received, the local host should send
              commands to the device at successively higher speeds until a valid response is received.

       ATNI?  Read nework information and store the information internally. Return the number of associated stations and  infor‐
              mation  about  the first associated station. The information includes the peer station device address, TX rate and
              RX rate.

       ATNIstation
              Extract and display previously stored network information for a specific peer station. The information returned is
              that previosly stored using a ATNI serial line command query.

       ATO    Exit  Command  Mode and enter Transparent Mode. Successful switch requires a valid destination MAC address, buffer
              size and aggregation timeout value. Use serial line commands ATDST and ATBSZ to get and/or set the first two  val‐
              ues. Use serial line command ATTO to set the timeout value.

       ATPStime
              Place  the  device  in  Power Save Mode for a specified time in seconds. Accepted values are 1 to 384 seconds. The
              default time is A seconds.

       ATRPlength,offset
              Read and display a parameter block segment where length is the number of bytes read and  offset  is  the  relative
              position,  in bytes, from the start of the parameter block. Valid length values are 0 through 400 hexadecimal. See
              option -p above to read and save an entire parameter block.

       ATRPM  Get PIB version and device MAC address.

       ATRV   Get hardware and firmware revision. See option -r above.

       ATSK?  Get device Network Membership Key. See option -m above.

       ATSKkey
              Set device Network Membership Key. See option -M above.

       ATTO?  Get the Transparent Mode aggregation timeout in milliseconds.

       ATTOtimeout
              Set the Transparent Mode aggregation timeout in milliseconds. See option -W above.

       ATWNVmodule
              Update NVM with PIB and/or Firmware module. See option -C above.

       ATWPFmodule,length,offset,checksum,data
              Write a parameter block or firmware segment to the local powerline device where module is the  module  identifier,
              length  is the number of bytes to write, offset is the relative position from the start of the module, checksum is
              the 1’s complement of the data and data is the data to be written.  Valid module identifiers are 1=FW  and  2=PIB.
              Valid  length  values are 0 up to 400 hexadecimal.  See options -N and -P above to write an entire parameter block
              or firmware images.

       ATZ    Reset device.  See option -R above.

DISCLAIMER
       Atheros serial line commands are proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.  Consequently, public information is  not
       available.  Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to modify command line syntax or command functionality in future firmware
       releases without any obligation to notify or compensate product or program users.

EXAMPLES
       The following example sets the baud speed to 115200 baud with 8 data bits, 1 stop bits, no flow control  and  no  parity.
       The outgoing serial line command and incoming response are displayed on stderr because option -f is present.

          #int6kbaud -B 115200 -D 8 -F 0 -P 0 -S 1 -v
          ATBR00,000000000001C200,08,00,01,00
          OK

       Observe that decimal command line arguments are converted to hexadecimal on output.  Although this program outputs fixed-
       length fields, including leaing zeros, device firmware ignores them.  Leading zeros may be omitted when  entering  serial
       line commands manually.

       The  next example set the speed to 38400.  Observe that program default values appear in the outgoing serial line command
       when the corresponding command line options are omitted.

          #int6kbaud -B 38400 -v
          ATBR00,0000000000009600,08,00,01,00
          OK

       The next command does the same thing as the first example except that keywords replace numeric values  for  some  of  the
       options.  Since option -v is omitted the outgoing command and incoming response are not displayed.
          #int6kbaud -B 115200 -D 8 -F off -P none -S 1
