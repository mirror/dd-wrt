plclog(1)                                    Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                   plclog(1)

NAME
       plclog - Qualcomm Atheros Log Retrieval Utility

SYNOPSIS
       plclog [options] [device] [device] [...]  [&gt;stdout]

DESCRIPTION
       Read  and print the device watchdog and checkpoint report on stdout for subsequent analysis by Atheros Technical Support.
       Report output is in XML format and contains base-64 encoded binary data returned by the device.  Aside from the XML tags,
       output is not in human readable format.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify custom watchdog report.

       -C     Clear the report after reading.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -x     Print the report in XML format.  The default is raw (or binary) format.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets which  can
              be saved as text files for reference.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  MAC  address  of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If more than one address is
              specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is local.   See  DEVICES  for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

LOGFILES
       Log  files  are save in binary format by default but they can also be saved in XML format by adding option -x to the com‐
       mand line.  By convention, binary log files have a .log extension and XML log files have a .xlog extension.   The  exten‐
       sion is not critical but it helps us determine the format before we open the file.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices  use  Ethernet  Media  Access  Control  (MAC)  addresses.   MAC  addresses  are  12 hexadecimal digits
       (0123456789ABCDEFabcdef) in upper, lower or mixed case.  Individual octets may be separated by colons, for  clarity,  but
       not  all octets need to be seperated.  For example, &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and
       equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be expressed by name instead of number.

       all    Equivalent to &quot;broadcast&quot;, described next.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the standard Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local,  remote  or
              foreign will respond to this address.

       local  A  synonym  for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.  All local
              Atheros devices will recognize this address but remote and foreign devices will  not.   A  remote  device  is  any
              device at the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       Ocala FL USA.  Consequently, public information is not available.  Atheros Communications reserves the  right  to  modify

EXAMPLES
       The following example reads the Watchdog and Checkpoint Report from device 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 and prints them on stdout in
       XML  format.  The output contains data segments formatted in base-64 notation which preserved data integrity when read or
       transmitted in text format.

          # plclog 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02

       The next example does the same thing but pipes output to file temp.log.  Atheros recommends using a  .log  extension  for
       compatibility with the WIndows Device Manager.

          # plclog 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 &gt; temp.log
