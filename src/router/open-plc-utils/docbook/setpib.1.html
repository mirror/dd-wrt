setpib(1)                                    Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                   setpib(1)

NAME
       setpib - Qualcomm Atheros PIB File Editor

SYNOPSIS
       setpib [options] file base [type data] [type data] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Replace  one  or more values in a Qualcomm Atheros powerline parameter (or PIB) file and re-compute the checksum.  Values
       are specified as a sequence of type/data pairs.  Users must know the offset, length and type of the values they change or
       problems will certainly result.  This program makes absolutely no effort to validate offsets or values.

       This  program  can  be used to change any PIB value, including those that should not be changed.  Be warned that some PIB
       values are derived from, or interact with, other PIB values.  Failure to observe such dependencies may  diminish  perfor‚Äê
       mance or render a device inoperable.

       Atheros  does not recommend the use of this program to edit PIB parameters because small mistakes can cause big problems.
       In addition, Atheros is under no obligation to provide customers with the offset, length or type of any PIB file  parame‚Äê
       ters.

       Atheros  recommends  using  program  modpib to change device identity parameters and the Windows Device Manager to change
       other parameters whenever possible.

       This program handles older Thunderbolt/Lightning parameter files and newer Panther/Lynx parameter  files  but  it  has  a
       larger  footprint  that may not be acceptable for embedded systems.  In cases where only the older or the newer parameter
       files are used, consider using program setpib1 for an older Thunderbolt/Lightning only version or  setpib2  for  a  newer
       Panther/Lynx only version.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -q     Enable quiet mode which has not effect.

       -v     Print a hexdump of the edited region.  Print hexdump headers if this option appears twice.  The region window  may
              be changed with option -w.

       -w window
              The  display  window  in  bytes.  When option -v is present, PIB information surrounding the edited region is dis‚Äê
              played to provide some sort of context.  The edited region appears in the middle of this window.  The default win‚Ä‚Äê
              dow is 32 bytes.  This means that the 32 bytes before and the 32 bytes after the edited region are included in the
              display.

       -x     Repair the checksum.  By default, this program does not modify files that fail the size or checksum test on input.
              In addition, it does not re-compute the checksum on output if no data has changed.  This option skips the size and
              checksum test on input and re-computes the checksum on output even if no data has changed.  This option only works
              on legacy PIB files.  It does not work on PIB files having NVM file format.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Usethis option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which  version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The  PIB  filename.  The file must exist and will be re-written.  No assumptions are made based on filename and no
              filename conventions are enforced.  This argument is required and must precede the base argument.

       base   The byte offset where changes will start.  The offset is expressed in hexadecimal with (or  without)  the  leading
              &quot;0x&quot;.   Changes  are  applied  in  order, left to right, and offset automatically increments by the correct amount
              after each change is applied.  This permits consectuive PIB locations to be changed with one command.  This  argu‚Äê
              ment  is  required  and must follow the file argument.  It must also precede all format/data pairs.  Normally, you
              must use multiple setpib commands to change non-consecutive PIB locations but  careful  use  of  format  skip  can
              achive the same results using one command.

       type   The  implied  length  and  encoding of the data.  Valid types are byte, word, long, data and hfid.  A valid format
              must precede each data item.  A byte is 8 bits, a word is 16 bits, a long is 32 bits and a huge is 64  bits.   The
              format  implies  the maximum data value except for format data which is limited by the number of octets entered on
              the command line.

       data   The information written to the current PIB offset.  Integer data may be expressed in binary, decimal or  hexadeci‚Äê
              mal  but  must  not  exceed the type minimum or maximum.  String data may contain any ASCII characters that can be
              entered via keyboard but must be enclosed in quotes when spaces are included.  Binary values start with 0b  or  0B
              and hexadecimal values start with 0x or 0X.

FORMATS
       byte integer
              A  signed or unsigned integer stored as 8 bits or 1 byte.  The value is expressed in decimal by default.  A binary
              value may be expressed with a 0b prefix.  A hexadecimal value may  be  expressed  using  a  0x  prefix.   Negative
              type/data values must appear at the end of the command line, after option &quot;--&quot;, to avoid parsing errors.  The off‚Äê
              set increments by 1 prior to the next insertion.

       word integer
              A signed or unsigned integer stored as 16 bits or 2 bytes.  The value is  expressed  in  decimal  by  default.   A
              binary value may be expressed with a 0b prefix.  A hexadecimal value may be expressed using a 0x prefix.  Negative
              type/data values must appear at the end of the command line, after option &quot;--&quot;, to avoid parsing errors.  The off‚Äê
              set increments by 2 prior to the next insertion.

       long integer
              A  signed  or  unsigned  integer  stored  as 32 bits or 4 bytes.  The value is expressed in decimal by default.  A
              binary value may be expressed with a 0b prefix.  A hexadecimal value may be expressed using a 0x prefix.  Negative
              type/data values must appear at the end of the command line, after option &quot;--&quot;, to avoid parsing errors.  The off‚Äê
              set increments by 4 prior to the next insertions.

       huge integer
              A signed or unsigned integer stored as 64 bits or 8 bytes.  The value is  expressed  in  decimal  by  default.   A
              binary value may be expressed with a 0b prefix.  A hexadecimal value may be expressed using a 0x prefix.  The off‚Äê
              set increments by 8 prior to the next insertion.  Negative type/data values must appear at the end of the  command
              line, after option &quot;--&quot;, to avoid parsing errors.  This format is only available on hosts that support 64 bit data
              values.

       data hex
              A sequence of hexadecimal octets.  Octets may be separated by a colon for clarity.  The number  of  octets  deter‚Äê
              mines  the  number  of  bytes  written.  The offset increments by the number of bytes written.  This is similar to
              &quot;key&quot; and &quot;mac&quot; below but accepts variable length input.

       key hex
              A sequence of hexadecimal octets.  Octets may be separated by a colon for clarity.  The number of octets must con‚Äê
              vert  to 16 bytes or an error will occur.  The offset increments by 16 prior to the next insertion.  This is simi‚Äê
              lar &quot;data&quot; above but accepts only fixed length input.  This option may be used to set the DAK, NMK or NVAK values.

       mac hex
              A sequence of hexadecimal octets.  Octets may be separated by a colon for clarity.  The number of octets must con‚Äê
              vert to 6 bytes or an error will occur.  The offset increments by 6 prior to the next insertion.  This is  similar
              &quot;data&quot; above but accepts only fixed length input.  This option may be used to set the DAK, NMK or NVAK values.

       text string
              An  ASCII character string.  The string string length determines the number of bytes stored.  The string is stored
              with NUL terminator included.  It is not padded or truncated.  The offset increments by the number of bytes stored
              prior to the next insertion.  This option may be used to enter a variable length string.

       hfid string
              An  ASCII  character string.  The string is always stored as 64 bytes.  Short strings are padded on the right with
              NUL characters.  Long strings are truncated on the right and the last byte is forced to NUL.   The  offset  incre‚Äê
              ments  by  64 bytes prior to the next insertion.  This option may be used to enter user, network and  manufacturer
              identification strings.

       zero count
              An unsigned integer representing the number of consecutive bytes to fill with 0x00.  The offset increments by  the
              number of bytes written.  This option may be used to erase regions of the PIB.

       fill count
              An  unsigned integer representing the number of consecutive bytes to fill with 0xFF.  The offset increments by the
              number of bytes written.  This option may be used to erase regions of the PIB.

       skip count
              An unsigned integer indicating the number of bytes to skip over before staring another change.   Intervening  data
              data locations are unchanged.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  edits  file  abc.pib  by  writing  decimal  value 1 at offset 01F7 followed by hexadecimal value
       00B052BABE01.  A partial dump is printed showing 16 bytes before and 16 bytes after the changed data because the  default
       display  windows is 16 bytes.  Unless the change occurs right at the start or end of the file, it will appear in the cen‚Äê
       ter of the display window.

          # setpib -v abc.pib 01F7 byte 1 data 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01

       The following example sets the manufacturer HFID string in PIB file def.pib.  HFID strings are  64  characters  long  and
       either truncated or padded on the right with NUL characters.  You may need to enclose the string in quotes it it contains
       spaces.

       The following example displays the contents of PIB file abc.pib without changing any data.  The region  displayed  is  24
       bytes  starting  at  offset 0x24.  The format skip specifies the region but does not change it.  By default, the 32 bytes
       before and 32 bytes after are included in the display.  This technique can be used to inspect a specific portion of a PIB
       file.

       The  next example does the same thing for a negative value.  This is tricky because the minus sign will be interpreted as
       the start of another option.  We must use &quot;--&quot; to end normal option parsing.  This is a POSIX standard feature.  See IEEE
       Std 1002.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines for more an explanation.

       The  following example computes a new checksum without changing any data.  The filename and an offset are required but no
       other values are needed.  This technique can be used to compute a new checksum after modifying the  file  using  software
       that does not update the checksum.
