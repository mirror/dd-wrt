plcmdio32(1)                                 Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                plcmdio32(1)

NAME
       plcmdio32 - Qualcomm Atheros 32-bit MDIO Register Editor

SYNOPSIS
       plcmdio32 [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Read  or  write  global  MDIO registers using multiple VS_MDIO_COMMAND vendor-specific management messages.  Commands are
       entered using 32-bit register and data values then converted to threeequivalen  16-bit commands.  The  default  operation
       is  to read a register.  Registers are written only if data is specified on the command line.  Thsi program replaces pro‐
       gram int6kmdio2.

       This program writes MDIO instructions using 802.3ae Clause 45 (address, data and mask) format.  See program int6kmdio for
       a similar program to write instructions using 802.3 Clause 22 (phy, reg, data and mask) format.

       This  program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  It replaces legacy program int6kmdio2.  See the plc man
       page for an overview and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -a address
              The 19-bit global register address.  Some devices may not  support  all  possible  addresses.   Addresses  may  be
              expressed  in  decimal,  hexadecimal  or  binary notation.  Hexadecimal values must be prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot;.
              Binary values must be prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or &quot;0B&quot;.

       -d data
              A 32-bit data value to be inserted into the specified register.  The specified data value  is  written  when  this
              option  is  present;  otherwise  the  specified register is read and the content is displayed.  Data values may be
              expressed in decimal, hexadecimal or binary notation.  Hexadecimal values are prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot;.   Binary
              values are prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or &quot;0B&quot;.

       -e     Redirects  stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -h     When writing 32-bit values, write to the high-order register before the low-order register.  This option is needed
              in  cases  where the value in one register may affect the interpretation of some value written to the other regis‐
              ter.  This is not a common situation.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received  via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network connection; however, if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it  takes  precedence  over  the  default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Displays  program  help information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on the command
              line except version information.

       -!,--version
              Displays program version information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on  the  com‐
              mand line except help information.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros technical staff.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  MAC  address  of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If more than one address is
              specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is local.   See  DEVICES  for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hex‐
       adecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For  example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local, remote or foreign
              recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline  connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A  synonym  for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.  All local
              Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is  any  device  at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
