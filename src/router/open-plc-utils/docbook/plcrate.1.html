plcrate(1)                                   Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                  plcrate(1)

NAME
       plcrate - Qualcomm Atheros AR7x00 PHY Rate Monitor

SYNOPSIS
       plcrate [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  Atheros  PHY  Rate Utility polls one or more devices and prints the average transmit and receive PHY rates between a
       device and each neighboring network device.  Output is column-oriented and suitable for loading  into  a  spreadsheet  or
       being read by a simple program.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

CHIPSETS
       QCA6410, QCA7000, QCA7420

OPTIONS
       -c     Display coded PHY rates.  Coded PHY rates are displayed by default so this option is redundant  but  it  has  been
              kept for backword compatibility.  This option and option -u are mutually exclusive.

       -d seconds
              Traffic  duration in seconds per connection.  Directional traffic is systematically sent between each pair of pow‐
              erline network devices for this period of time.  Consequently, the total time needed to generate  traffic  between
              all network devices will be approximately n! times this value, so don’’t get carried away.  The minimum value is 1
              second and the maximum value is 60 seconds.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -n     Reads the average transmit and receive PHY rate for wach device using VS_NW_INFO and prints it  on  stdout.   Each
              output  line  displays  the  ethernet  interface,  source  address, destination address and either the transmit or
              receive PHY rate.

       -o milliseconds
              Read timeout in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is  the  maximum  time  allowed  for  a
              response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -q     Enter quiet mode.  Progress messages are suppressed.

       -r     Reads device hardware and software revision information using VS_SW_VER and prints it on stdout.

       -R     Resets the device using VS_RS_DEV.

       -t     Generate  powerline traffic between the local device and each remote device on each powerline network connected to
              the host.  It does not generate any traffic between remote powerline device pairs.  This option is especially use‐
              ful  when  remote  powerline  devices are not connected to Ethernet devices capable of sending traffic back to the
              host.

       -T     Generate powerline traffic between all devices on each powerline network connected to the host.   This  option  is
              similar  to  option  -t  but it takes much longer because traffic is systematically generated between each pair of
              powerline devices.  Consequently, the time to complete will increase factorially as the number of network  devices
              increases.  Such complete traffic path coverage is not always needed.

       -u     Display  un-coded  PHY  rates.   Coded PHY rates are displayed by default.  This option and option -c are mutually
              exclusive.

       -v     Enter verbose mode.  All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program are displayed on stdout.

       -x     Exit program on first error with a non-zero exit code.  This option allows  shell  scripts  to  detect  failed  or
              incomplete operations and take the appropriate action.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  MAC  address  of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If more than one address is
              specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is local.   See  DEVICES  for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hex‐
       adecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For  example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local, remote or foreign
              recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline  connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A  synonym  for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.  All local
              Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is  any  device  at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  displays  the  average  transmit and receive PHY rates from each of two devices.  One is a local
       device connected to interface eth2 and the other is a remote device at the far end of the powerline.  In this case,  they
       are the only two devices on the powerline network.  Observe the recipricol rates shown.

          # plcrate -ni eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB TX 163 mbps
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB RX 176 mbps
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:BB 00:B0:52:00:00:AA TX 176 mbps
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:BB 00:B0:52:00:00:AA RX 163 mbps

       The  following  example  generates powerline traffic between the local device and each remote device because option -t is
       present.  It then displays the PHY rate read from the local device.

          # plcrate -tni eth2
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB TX 163 mbps
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB RX 176 mbps
