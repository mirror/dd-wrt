pcapdevs(1)                                  Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                 pcapdevs(1)

NAME
       pcapdevs - Qualcomm Atheros PCAP Device Enumerator

SYNOPSIS
       pcapdevs [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The pcapdevs program enumerates available libpcap or winpcap devices on stdout.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for compilation and installation
       instructions.

COMMENTS
       This program is only compiled in the Windows version of the toolkit because it is not needed on other platforms.  It  can
       be  compiled,  possibly  with  some  modifications,  on  Linux or OpenBSD systems where libpcap development libraries are
       installed.

BACKGROUND
       The Atheros Powerline Toolkit uses the libpcap or winpcap package to enable raw socket operations on systems that have no
       native  raw  packet  support.  Unfortunately, libpcap and winpcap reference available network interfaces by number rather
       than by name.  Consequently, users need some way to determine what network interfaces are  available  and  determine  the
       number associated with each one.  This utility does that.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print  bash  compatible variable definitions on stdout.  The definitions enumerate available devices and their MAC
              addresses.  This is merely a convenience to minimze typing errors and, consequently, some editing may be required.
              The output is a generous start when creating file hardware.sh.

       -q     Suppresses printing of progress messages.

       -v     Print additional information.

EXAMPLES
       The following command enumerates available libpcap devices for a Linux host.  Users should note the interface numbers and
       use them when specifying a network interfaces on libpcap  enabled  programs  in  this  toolkit.   The  Ethernet  hardware
       addresses shown may be useful when writing scripts.

          # pcapdevs
          1 00:60:97:05:97:0C eth0
          2 00:0F:EA:10:D5:1C eth1
          3 00:0F:EA:10:D5:1C any (Pseudo-device that captures on all interfaces)
          4 00:00:00:00:00:00 lo

       The  next  example  enumaerates available winpcap devices on a Windows hosts.  Observe that device names and descriptions
       are much longer than on Linux.

          # pcapdevs
          1 00:00:00:00:00:00 \Device\NPF_GenericDialupAdapter     (Adapter for generic dialup and VPN capture)
          2 00:0E:2E:03:5F:B8 \Device\NPF_{4CFAABD5-C929-4942-914B-BDFE72B13611} (Realtek RTL8139 Family)
          3 00:C0:49:D5:CB:14 \Device\NPF_{73E0D2EF-6069-4831-B379-507025F2BDCD} (Realtek RTL8139 Family)
          4 00:0C:76:87:3E:3D \Device\NPF_{86B96905-3AA7-46F1-969A-6C23E3BBBA8B} (Broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit)

       Assuming that we have compiled and installed the Linux Toolkit with libpcap or winpcap  support,  we  can  use  int6k  to
       request  revision  information  on  all  devices connected to interface 2 with the following command.  Interface 2 is the
       default interface when the toolkit is comipled with either libpcap or winpcap and so option -i could have been omitted in
       this case.

          # int6k -i 2 -r

       Most  example Atheros scripts include file hardware.sh that defines symbolic Ethernet interfaces, NIC1 and NIC2 and their
       respective hardware addresses, MAC1 and MAC2.  These symbols are referenced by scripts when needed, providing a degree of
       host  independence.   The following example illustrates some typical output for a Windows environment.  The output can be
       used with the Cygwin bash shell, for example.

          # pcapdevs -h &gt; hardware.sh
          # cat hardware.sh
          NIC1=1 # Adapter for generic dialup and VPN capture
          NIC2=2 # Realtek RTL8139 Family Fast Ethernet Adapter (Microsoft’s Packet Scheduler)
          NIC3=3 # Realtek RTL8139 Family Fast Ethernet Adapter (Microsoft’s Packet Scheduler)
          NIC4=4 # Broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Ethernet Driver
          MAC1=00:00:00:00:00:00 # Adapter for generic dialup and VPN capture
          MAC2=00:0E:2E:03:5F:B8 # Realtek RTL8139 Family Fast Ethernet Adapter (Microsoft’s Packet Scheduler)
          MAC3=00:C0:49:D5:CB:14 # Realtek RTL8139 Family Fast Ethernet Adapter (Microsoft’s Packet Scheduler)
          MAC4=00:0C:76:87:3E:3D # Broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Ethernet Driver

       The previous example creats a basic hardware.sh file but some editing is still required.  You should add a bang  path  at
       the top, delete definitions of NIC1 and MAC and renumber the remaining symbols.  You may also want to add other host-spe‐
       cific definitions.
