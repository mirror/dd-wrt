pibruin(1)                                   Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                  pibruin(1)

NAME
       pibruin - Classification Rule Insert Utility

SYNOPSIS
       pibruin [options] [&lt;rules] file

DESCRIPTION
       Read  a  set of classification rules from stdin and insert them directly into a PIB file.  This program is an alternative
       to program int6krule and a companion to program pibrump.  Although it is possible to ruin a PIB using this  command,  the
       name is short for &quot;rule insert&quot;.

       Atheros  recommends that users validate all classification rule sets used with this program before inserting them into an
       operational PIB.  Individual rules may be syntactically valid but they can still be technically invalid or conflict  with
       other.  This program does not perform any technical or cross-rule validation what-so-ever.

       Cross-rule  validation  is  normally  done by runtime firmware when a rule arrives in a VS_CLASSIFIER management message.
       This validation prevents the insertion of meaningless or conflicting rules into the PIB.  It may be possible to commit  a
       PIB containing mis-configured classification rule sets thus causing the device to lockup or misbehave on reboot.

       One  recommended  method of rule set validation is to program a device with individual rules using program int6krule then
       read the PIB and extract the rule set with program pibrump.  The rule set should be valid at that point.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -o offset
              Specify  an alternative PIB offset when inserting the classifier block.  Customers should not use this option.  It
              is provided to account for firmware changes that might occur in the future.  Improper use of this option can  ren‐
              der a PIB file unrecoverable.

       -q     Suppresses progress messages.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The  name of a valid Atheros runtime parameter file.  The file is modified by this program only if the classifica‐
              tion rule file is syntactically correct.  See the DISCLAIMER section below.  No backup file is created.   By  con‐
              vention,  runtime  parameter  files  have a .pib extention but this program does not enforce that convention.  The
              file must exist and be a valid PIB file or errors will occur.

       rules  The name of a valid classifier rule file.  The file is not modified by this program.  Classifier  rule  files  are
              standard ASCII text and may be created manually using a normal text editor or may be generated automatically using
              another program such as pubrump.  By convention, classifier rule files have a ..qos  extension  but  this  program
              does not enforce that convention.  If this file is omitted then rules are read from from the console, one rule per
              line.

DISCLAIMER
       PIB file structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.  Consequently, public information is not
       available.  Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to change the file structure or content in future firmware releases with‐
       out any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.

       This program is provided for convenience only.  It is possible to insert meaningless or confilicting rule sets into a PIB
       with  this  program  because  approved  cross-rule validation is not performed.  Incorrect application of perfectly valid
       rules may render a device ineffective or unusable on a powerline network.  Program users  are  responsible  for  ensuring
       that their rule sets are verified by other means before using this program to insert them into an operational PIB file.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  is  an example set of classification rules stored in file rules.txt.  The file contains 5 rules, one rule
       per line.  The rules are identical to command line arguments expected by program int6krule and one could type  them,  one
       at  a  time,  into  int6krule  and  wait  for  the device to reset each time.  Alternately, we could insert all the rules
       directly into a PIB file at once then download and commit the PIB, resulting in only one reset.

          # cat rules.txt
          Cap1 any VLANID is 20 add perm
          DropRX any VLANID is 25 add perm
          StripRx any VLANID is 5 VLANID is 10 VLANID is 15 add perm
          StripRx any VLANID is 20 add perm
          Cap1 any VLANID is 5 VLANID is 10 VLANID is 15 add perm

       The following example reads file rules.txt from stdin and writes it into file def.pib.  This may be usefule if one wanted
       to distribute a known set of rules to other users or wanted to test various combinations of rules.  Sincd rule files are

          # pibruin &lt; rules.txt

       The  next  example  reads  classification rules directly from file abc.pib using program pibrump and writes them directly
       into file def.pbi using program pibruin.  This is one means of transfering classification rules from one PIB to  another.
