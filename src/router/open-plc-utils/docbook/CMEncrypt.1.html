CMEncrypt(1)                                 Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                CMEncrypt(1)

NAME
       CMEncrypt - Send Encrypted Payload

SYNOPSIS
       CMEncrypt [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Transmit  a  file  over  powerline  using  CM_ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD messages.  This program tests and demonstrates proper (or
       improper) message routing but does not support encrypted transmission.  All payloads are sent unencrypted at this time.

OPTIONS
       -A status
              The AVLN Status.  This indicates the current association status and capabilities of the sending station.   Permit‐
              ted  values  are  0  through  255  but only value 0 through 5 and 8 are recognized by the firmware.  Values may be
              entered in decimal, hexadecimal or binary format.  Hexadecimal value are prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot;.  Binary  val‐
              ues are prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or &quot;0B&quot;.  The default is 0.

       -f file
              The  name  of the payload file.  File content may be text or binary and forms the payload of one or more messages.
              Payloads are transmitted unencrypted when PID is 4 and PEKS is 15 which is default.

       -K PEKS
              The Payload Encryption Key Select.  This value indicates the key used to encrypt the  payload.   Permitted  values
              are 0 through 15.  Values may be entered in decimal, hexadecimal or binary format.  Hexadecimal value are prefixed
              with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot;.  Binary values are prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or &quot;0B&quot;..  The default is 15 for &quot;No Encryption&quot;.

       -P PID The Protocol Identifier.  This value detemines how the payload is interpreted  by  powerline  devices.   Permitted
              values are 0 through 4.  The default is 4 for &quot;HLE Protocol&quot;.

       -v     Print incoming and outgoing Ethernet frames in hex dump format on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  Media  Access  Control  (MAC)  address of a remote host, not a powerline device.  Addresses are 6 hexadecimal
              octets optionally separated  by  colon.   For  example,  the  addresses  &quot;00b052000001&quot;,  &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot;  and
              &quot;00b052:000001&quot;  are  all  valid  and  equivalent.   For  convenience,  the  symbolic  address &quot;local&quot; resolves to
              &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and the symbolic addresses &quot;all&quot; and &quot;broadcast&quot; both resolve to &quot;ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff&quot;.

INTERNALS
       This program lets the user specify some CM_ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD fields but not others.  The following are  fields  that  the
       user cannot specify.  The program automatically computes these values.

       PRN    The Protocol Run Number.  This is a random number used to distinguish between runs having the same protocol.  This
              program uses the system time variable.

       UUID   The Universally Unique Identifier.  This program uses the left-most 16 bytes of the SHA256 digest for the payload.

REFERENCES
       Consult the HomePlug AV Specification or Atheros Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example transmits file myfile.txt to host 00:85:73:00:94:01 in unecrypted format because that is the pro‐
       gram default.  The remote address is required and refers to the ultimate recipient, not the local device.

          # CMEncrypt -f myfile.txt 00:85:73:00:94:01 The next example  does  the  same  but  specifies  the  program  defaults.
       Observe that operands can be expressed in decimal, binary or hexadecimal format.

          # CMEncrypt -f myfile.txt -A 0 -P 0b0100 -K 0x0F 00:85:73:00:94:01
