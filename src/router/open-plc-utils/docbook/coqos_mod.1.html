coqos_mod(1)                                 Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                coqos_mod(1)

NAME
       coqos_mod - Suspend or resume a managed data stream

SYNOPSIS
       coqos_mod [options] action cid [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       This page is under construction.

       Suspend  or  resume a stream through the bandwidth manager using an Atheros vendor specific VS_MOD_CONN message.  This is
       the proper way to stop a stream flowing if the data rate exceeds the available bandwidth.  Use program coqos_man  to  set
       stream bandwidth.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -r     Display relative memory offsets on output.  This option is the default.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Displays program help information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on  the  command
              line except version information.

       -!,--version
              Displays  program  version information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on the com‚Äê
              mand line except help information.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros technical staff.

ARGUMENTS
       action A symbol indicating the action to be performed on the stream identified by argument cid.  Valid actions are  &quot;sus‚Ä‚Äê
              pend&quot; and &quot;resume&quot;.  See ACTIONS for an explanation of each action.

       cid    A  connection  identifier.   (Charlie,  expand  on this.)  Connection ID.  2 byte number to identify the stream to
              delete.  Byte 0 is the OrigTEI and byte one is the LLID-F.

       device The MAC address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified on the command  line.   If  more
              than  one  address  is  specified  then  operations  are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is
              &quot;local&quot;.  See DEVICES for more information.

ACTIONS
       suspend
              Suspend the identified stream.  See argument cid for more information.

       resume Resume the identified stream.  See argument cid for more information.

DEVICES
       Ethernet MAC addresses are expressed as six hexadecimal octets optionally separated by colon.  For example, the  Qualcomm
       Atheros  Local  Management Address (LMA) of &quot;00b052000001&quot; may also be entered as &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; or &quot;00b052:000001&quot;.
       Addresses are case insensitive and quotes are optional.  In addition, some special  addresses  may  be  entered  by  name
       rather than number where names are case sensitive.

       all    A synonym for the &quot;broadcast&quot; address, described next.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local, remote or foreign
              will respond to this address.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.   All  local
              Atheros  devices  recognize  this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is any device at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.  Ethernet  MAC
              addresses  are  six  hexadecimal octets optionally separated by colon.  For example, the addresses &quot;00b052000001&quot;,
              &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are all valid and equivalent.  Certain Ethernet device addresses are  spe‚Äê
              cial and may be entered by name rather than number.

       all    A synonym for &quot;broadcast&quot;, described next.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for the standard Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local, remote or
              foreign will respond to this address.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.   All  local
              Atheros  devices  recognize  this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is any device at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

EXAMPLES
       The following example suspends a stream 805.  All data in this cid will be discarded and not sent over the channel.
