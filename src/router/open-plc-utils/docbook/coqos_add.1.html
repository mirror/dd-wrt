coqos_add(1)                                 Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                coqos_add(1)

NAME
       coqos_add - Add a managed data stream

SYNOPSIS
       coqos_add action priority rate ttl operand condition [condition] [...]  [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       This page is under construction.

       Add  a  managed  stream  to  one  or  more powerline devices using the VS_CONN_ADD message.  Consult the Qualcomm Atheros
       Firmware Technical Reference Manual for a description of this vendor specific message type.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

BACKGROUND
       Bandwidth  management  prioritizes  streams so that data from lowest priority stream is dropped first whenever one of the
       following conditions is detected.  This ensures that the remaining streams continue operate at their full pontential.

       Degraded line condition
              The channel degrades to the point where the available PHY rate from the transmitter to the receiver is too low due
              to the variability of the power line.s characteristics.

       Over subscription
              Too  much  data  is  being  sent per second, resulting in packet loss due to excessive collisions due to excessive
              channel oversubscription.

       Lack of channel Capacity
              On starting new source there is not enough channel capacity to support it.

OPTIONS
       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention progress messages and error messages  are  printed  on  stderr
              while primary program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is
              desired.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received  via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network connection; however, if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it  takes  precedence  over  the  default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -r     Display relative memory offsets on output.  This option is the default.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Displays  program  help information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on the command
              line except version information.

       -!,--version
              Displays program version information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on  the  com‐
              mand line except help information.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros technical staff.

ARGUMENTS
       action The action taken for frames that satisfy the selection criteria.  Valid actions are &quot;CAP0&quot;, &quot;CAP1&quot;, &quot;CAP2&quot;, &quot;CAP3&quot;
              to specify the channel access priority queue.  CAP0 and CAP1 are for best effort data.  CAP2 is for video and  non
              urgent MMEs.  CAP3 is for voice, urgent MMEs and control messages such as IGMP and MLD.

       priority
              The  relative priority of this stream.  Valid values are 0 through 15 where 0 is the lowest priority and 15 is the
              highest.

       destination
              The destination MAC address.

       rate   The average expected data rate for this stream.  Valid values are 1 to 9000 where units are in 10kbps so the mini‐
              mum rate is 10kbps and the maximum rate is 90mbps.

       ttl    The  time to live for this stream.  Valid values are 10000 to 2000000 where units are in microseconds so the mini‐
              mum is time is 10 milliseconds and the maximum time is 2 seconds.

       operand
              The operand specifies the logical relationship between conditions before the action to be taken.   Valid  operands
              are listed and described under OPERANDS.

       condition
              A conditional expression consisting of a field, operator and value.  See CONDITIONS for more information.

       device The  MAC  address  of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified on the command line.  If more
              than one address is specified then operations are performed on each  device  in  turn.   The  default  address  is
              &quot;local&quot;.  See DEVICES for more information.

CONDITIONS
       A  condition consists of a field, an operator and a value.  One condition is required but three are permitted.  Condition
       order is not important but all conditions must appear after the operand and before the control.

       field  The field is the part of the Ethernet frame to be examined.  Some fields are not valid for some actions  but  this
              program  does not enforce such rules since validation is performed by runtime firmware on each device.  Recognized
              fields are listed and described under FIELDS.

       operator
              The operator specifies the relationsip that must exist between the field and value in order for the  condition  to
              evaluate  True.  Currently, only equality operators are supported.  Valid operators are listed and described under
              OPERATORS.

       value  The value must be appropriate to the field type.  Some fields are MAC or IP addresses, some are integers, some are
              bitmaps  and  others  are states.  Integers and bitmaps may be expressed in binary, decimal or hexadecimal format.
              Binary values staRt with 0b.  Hexadecimal values start with 0x.  States are expressed using keywords.   Users  are
              responsible  for  knowing  how many bits are significant for each type of value.  Valid values are described along
              with fields under FIELDS.

OPERANDS
       The operand indicates the logical relationship that must exist between conditions in the rule set before  the  action  is
       applied  to  a frame.  Operands are expressed as discrete alphanumeric strings entered in upper, lower or mixed character
       case.  Failure to enter a known operand will result in an error message that lists all possible operands.  They are posi‐
       ton sensitive.  One operand is allowed and it must appear after the action and before any condition.

       Any    Apply the action to frames that satisfy any of the conditions.  This is equivalent to the logical or operation.

       All    Apply the action to frames that satisfy all of the conditions.  This is equivalent to the logical and operation.

       Always Apply the action to all frames, regardless of any and all conditions that may be specified.

FIELDS
       Fields indicate the portion of the frame that is inspected during selection and the size and format of the value permited
       in the condition statement.  They are expressed as discrete alphanumeric strings entered in upper, lower or mixed charac‐
       ter case.  Failure to enter a known field will result in an error message that lists all possible fields.

       ET     A 16-bit Ethertype expressed in decimal, hexadecimal or binary.  The format is described in IEEE Standard 802-2001
              [4].

       EthDA  A 48-bit Ethernet destination address expressed in hexadecimal.  The format is described in IEEE Standard 802-2001
              [4].

       VLANUP An 8-bit Ethernet VLAN tag where the lower 3 bits are the User Priority sub-field of a VLAN Tag  defined  in  IEEE
              Std 802.1Q-1998 (Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks) [11].  The upper 5 bits should be zero.

       VLANID A  16-bit  VLAN  identifier  where the lower 12 bits are the VLAN Identifier (VID) defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q-1998
              (Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks) [11].  The upper 4 bits should be zero.

       IPV4TOS
              An 8-bit Type-of-Service code where the format is defined in the RFC 791 (Internet Protocol) [14].

       IPV4PROT
              An 8-bit Ethernet Protocol identifier.  The format is defined in the RFC 791 (Internet Protocol) [14].

       IPV4SA A 32-bit Internet Protocol source address expressed in dotted-decimal notation.  The official format is defined in
              RFC  791  (Internet Protocol) [14].  Our implementation permits empty octets and leading zeros within fields.  For
              example, &quot;...&quot; is equivalent to &quot;0.0.0.0 and &quot;127..000.001&quot; is equivalent to &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;.

       IPV4DA A 32-bit Internet Protocol destination address expressed  in  dotted-decimal  notation.  The  official  format  is
              defined  in  RFC  791  (internet  Protocol) [14]. Our implementation permits empty octets and leading zeros within
              fields. For example, &quot;...&quot; is equivalent to &quot;0.0.0.0 and &quot;127..000.001&quot; is equivalent to &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;.

       IPV6TC An 8-bit Internet Protocol V6 traffic class expressed as defined in RFC 2460 (Internet Protocol Version 6) [17].

       IPV6FL A 24-bit IPV6 flow label where the lower 20 bits are the IPv6 Flow Label defined in RFC  2460  (Internat  Protocol
              Version  6)  [17].   The upper 4 bits should be zero.  The value can be entered either as a decimal, binary or hex
              integer.

       IPV6SA A 128-bit IPV6 source address expressed as colon-separated hexadecmial quartets (octet pairs).  The official  for‐
              mat  is defined in RFC 2460 (Internet Protocol Version 6) [17].  Our implementation permits multiple empty fields,
              abreviated fields and leading zeros within fields.  When multiple empty fields appear, only the  right-most  occu‐
              rance     expands     to     zeros.      For     example,     &quot;FFFF::DDDD::BBBB::AAAA&quot;     is     equivalent    to
              &quot;FFFF:0000:DDDD:0000:BBBB:0000:0000:AAAA&quot;.

       IPV6DA A 128-bit IPV6 destination address expressed as colon-separated hexadecimal quartets (octet pairs).  The  official
              format  is  defined  in  RFC  2460  (Internet Protocol Version 6) [17].  Our implementation permits multiple empty
              fields, abbreviated fields and leading zeros within fields.  When multiple empty fields appear,  only  the  right-
              most    occurance    expands    to    zeros.     For    example,   &quot;AAAA::BBBB::CCCC::DDDD&quot;   is   equivalent   to
              &quot;AAAA:0000:BBBB:0000:CCCC:0000:0000:DDDD&quot;.

       TCPSP  A 16-bit TCP source port as a decimal integer.  The format is defined in RFC 793  (Transmission  Control  Protocol
              [15]).

       TCPDP  A 16-bit TCP destination port expressed as a decimal integer.  The format is defined in RFC 793 (Transmission Con‐
              trol Protocol [15]).

       UDPSP  A 16-bit UDP source port expressed as a decimal integer.  The format is defined in RFC 768 (User Datagram Protocol
              [13]).

       UDPDP  A  16-bit  UDP  destination  port expressed as a decimal integer.  The format is defined in RFC 768 (User Datagram
              Protocol [13]).

       IPSP   A 16-bit IP source port expressed as a decimal integer.  This condition applies to  either  TCP  or  UDP  packets,
              depending on the protocol used, and is valid only for actions &quot;CAP0&quot;, &quot;CAP1&quot;, &quot;CAP2&quot;, &quot;CAP3&quot; and &quot;Drop&quot;.

       IPDP   A 16-bit IP destination port expressed as a decimal integer.  This condition applies to either TCP or UDP packets,
              depending on the protocol used, and is valid only for actions &quot;CAP0&quot;, &quot;CAP1&quot;, &quot;CAP2&quot;, &quot;CAP3&quot; and &quot;Drop&quot;.

       MME    A 24-bit Atheros HomePlugAV Management Message type expressed in hexadecimal.  The first byte is the MMV  and  the
              next  two  bytes  are  the MMTYPE for a HomePlug AV frame as defined in the HomePlug AV Specification.  The MMTYPE
              will match any MME sub-type (Request; Confirm; Indicate; Response).  This field is only valid for action  &quot;Boost&quot;.

OPERATORS
       An  operator  indicates an equality between a field and a value.  An operator is an alphanumeric string entered in upper,
       lower or mixed character case.  Failure to enter a known operator will result in an error message that lists all possible
       operators.  Operators are position sensitive and must appear between each field and value.

       Is     Indicates that the frame field must equal the associated value for the condition to evaluate true.

       Not    Indicates that the frame field must not equal the associated value for the condition to true true.

STATES
       A state is a special case of value.

       True,On,Yes,Present
              Indicates  a positive state or presence of some entity.  All are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.  Dou‐
              ble negatives are permitted so &quot;Is True&quot; is equvalent to &quot;Not False&quot;.

       False,Off,No,Missing
              Indicates a negative state or absence of some entity.  ALl are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.  Double
              negatives are permitted so &quot;Is False&quot; is equvalent to &quot;Not True&quot;.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hex‐
       adecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For  example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are common or special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local, remote or foreign
              recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline  connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A  synonym  for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.  All local
              Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is  any  device  at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.  See the Qual‐
              comm Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information.

DISCLAIMER
       Atheros HomePlug AV Vendor Specific Management Message structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL
       USA.   Consequently,  public  information  may  not  be available.  Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to modify message
       structure and content in future firmware releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.

EXAMPLES
       The following example adds a temporary stream to device 00:b0:52:BA:BE:01 which will then manage the bandwidth  for  that
       stream until removed with program coqos_rel.

            # coqos_add CAP2 15 5000 200000 any ethda is 192.168.105 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01

       This  adds a stream to the bandwidth manager that sets all traffic to destination address of 192.168.0.105 as priority 15
       (the highest priority).  This would then need to also be sent to each device on the network.  Refer to int6krule for more
       details on how to specify conditions.
