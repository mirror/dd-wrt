int6keth(1)                                  Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                 int6keth(1)

NAME
       int6keth - Qualcomm Atheros Ethernet PHY Settings

SYNOPSIS
       int6keth [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Read or write INT6x00 Ethernet PHY Settings using VS_ENET_SETTINGS.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -a mode
              Advertise auto-negotiate capabilities.  This option takes effect when option -w is present.  It  is  ignored  when
              option  -r  is  present.   Valid  values are &quot;1000Full&quot;, &quot;100Full&quot;, &quot;100Half&quot;, &quot;10Full&quot; and &quot;10Half&quot;.  The default
              value is no advertisement of capabilities.

       -d mode
              Device duplex transmission mode.  This option takes effect when option -w is present.  It is ignored  when  option
              -r is present.  Valid values are &quot;Half&quot; and &quot;Full&quot;.  The default value is &quot;Half&quot;.

       -e     Redirects  stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -f control
              Flow control enable.  This option takes effect when option -w is  present.   It  is  ignored  when  option  -r  is
              present.  Valid values are &quot;On&quot;, &quot;Off&quot;, &quot;Tx&quot; and &quot;Rx&quot;.  The default value is &quot;Off&quot;.

       -n mode
              Auto-negotiate  mode.   This  option  takes  effect  when  option  -w is present.  It is ignored when option -r is
              present.  Valid values are &quot;On&quot; and &quot;Off&quot;.  The default value is &quot;On&quot;.

       -p number
              The ethernet port number.  Available port numbers differ with chipset and firmware version so consult  the  appro‐
              priate technical documentation.  Permitted values are 0 through 7.  The default port is 0.

       -s speed
              Network  transmission  speed  in  mbps.   This  option takes effect when option -w is present.  It is ignored when
              option -r is present.  Valid values are &quot;10&quot;, &quot;100&quot; and &quot;1000&quot;.  The default value is &quot;10&quot;.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received  via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network connection; however, if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it  takes  precedence  over  the  default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -r     Read settings from the Ethernet interface on the designated port.  If present, or implied by default, then options
              -a, -d, -f, -n and -s have no effect.  This option and option -w are mutually exclusive.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets which  can
              be saved as text files for reference.

       -w     Write  settings to the Ethernet interface on the specified port.  Be sure to specify all settings to avoid writing
              default values.  This option and option -r are mutually exclusive.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified on the command  line.   If  more
              than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is local.
              See DEVICES for information.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12  hex‐
       adecimal  digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local,  remote  or  foreign
              recognize  messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.   All  local
              Atheros  devices  recognize  this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is any device at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
