plcmdio16(1)                                 Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                plcmdio16(1)

NAME
       plcmdio16 - Qualcomm Atheros 16-bit MDIO Register Editor

SYNOPSIS
       plcmdio16 [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Read  or write generic MDIO registers using the Qualcomm Atheros VS_MDIO_COMMAND vendor-specific management message.  The
       default operation is to read a register.  Registers are written only if data is specified on the command line.  This pro‐
       gram replaces program int6kmdio.

       This program writes MDIO instructions using 802.3 Clause 22 (phy, reg, data and mask) format.  See program plcmdio162 for
       a similar program to write instructions using 802.3ae Clause 45 (address, data and mask) format.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  It replaces legacy program int6kmdio.  See the  plc  man
       page for an overview and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -d data
              A  16-bit  data  value  to be inserted into the specified register.  The specified data value is written when this
              option is present; otherwise the specified register is read and the content is  displayed.   Data  values  may  be
              expressed  in decimal, hexadecimal or binary notation.  Hexadecimal values are prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot;.  Binary
              values are prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or &quot;0B&quot;.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -p address
              The 5-bit PHY address.  Some devices may not support all possible addresses.  Addresses may be expressed in  deci‐
              mal,  hexadecimal  or binary notation.  Hexadecimal values must be prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot;.  Binary values must
              be prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or &quot;0B&quot;.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -r register
              The 5-bit register address.  Addresses may be expressed in decimal, hexadecimal or binary  notation.   Hexadecimal
              values  must  be  prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot;.  Binary values must be prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or &quot;0B&quot;.  Some devices may
              not support all possible addresses.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Displays program help information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on  the  command
              line except version information.

       -!,--version
              Displays  program  version information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on the com‐
              mand line except help information.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros technical staff.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If more than  one  address  is
              specified  then  operations  are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is local.  See DEVICES for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12  hex‐
       adecimal  digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local,  remote  or  foreign
              recognize  messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.   All  local
              Atheros  devices  recognize  this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is any device at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
