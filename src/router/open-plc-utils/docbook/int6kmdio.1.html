int6kmdio(1)                                 Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                int6kmdio(1)

NAME
       int6kmdio - Qualcomm Atheros 16-bit MDIO Register Editor

SYNOPSIS
       int6kmdio [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Read  or  write the generic MDIO registers on an Atheros powerline device using the Qualcomm Atheros VS_MDIO_COMMAND ven‐
       dor-specific management message.  The default operation is to read a register.  Registers are written  only  if  data  is
       specified on the command line.

       This program writes MDIO instructions using 802.3 Clause 22 (phy, reg, data and mask) format.  See program int6kmdio2 for
       a similar program to write instructions using 802.3ae Clause 45 (address, data and mask) format.

       This program is deprecated and may be removed in later toolkit releases.  Use program plcmdio16 instead.

OPTIONS
       -d data
              A 16-bit data value to be inserted into the specified register.  The specified data value  is  written  when  this
              option  is  present;  otherwise  the  specified register is read and the content is displayed.  Data values may be
              expressed in decimal, hexadecimal or binary notation.  Hexadecimal values are prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot;.   Binary
              values are prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or &quot;0B&quot;.

       -e     Redirects  stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received  via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network connection; however, if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it  takes  precedence  over  the  default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -p address
              The  5-bit PHY address.  Some devices may not support all possible addresses.  Addresses may be expressed in deci‐
              mal, hexadecimal or binary notation.  Hexadecimal values must be prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot;.  Binary  values  must
              be prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or &quot;0B&quot;.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -r register
              The  5-bit  register address.  Addresses may be expressed in decimal, hexadecimal or binary notation.  Hexadecimal
              values must be prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot;.  Binary values must be prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or &quot;0B&quot;.   Some  devices  may
              not support all possible addresses.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Displays  program  help information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on the command
              line except version information.

       -!,--version
              Displays program version information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on  the  com‐
              mand line except help information.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros technical staff.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  MAC  address  of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If more than one address is
              specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is local.   See  DEVICES  for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hex‐
       adecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For  example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local, remote or foreign
              recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline  connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A  synonym  for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.  All local
              Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is  any  device  at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
