mac2pwd(1)                                   Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                  mac2pwd(1)

NAME
       mac2pwd - Qualcomm Atheros Ethernet Device Password Generator

SYNOPSIS
       mac2pwd [options] file [file] [ ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Read Ethernet addresses from one or more files and print computed passwords with the associated address.  Input addresses
       can appear in any order and need not be consecutive.  Computed passwords consist of upper case letters (A-Z)  with  group
       separators.   The  algorithm  used  here is not mandatory for HomePlug AV compliance and so vendors are free to use other
       methods to generate their own device passwords.

       This program may be used to generate passwords for large numbers of non-consecutive MAC addresses that may occur in  ran‐
       dom order.  It complements program mac2pw which generates passwords for consecutive MAC addresses over a given range.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

CAVEATS
       Atheros provides this program as a simple means of generating unique and apparently random device passwords for  a  large
       volume  of  Ethernet  devices.   It  uses  a Linear Cogruential Random Number Generator to produce a single-wheel Bazerie
       Cylinder and to select characters from that cylinder.  The algorithm used is adequate for purpose and nothing more.  Ven‐
       dors are encouraged to develop their own means of generating passwords for the reasons mentioned below.

       MAC addresses can be determined using a variety of network management programs.  Anyone having access to this program, or
       the algorithm used, could compute the device password and gain access to device features reserved for priviledged  users.

OPTIONS
       -b bunch
              The  password  bunching  factor.  Passwords have a fixed number of upper case letters broken into groups separated
              with dashes.  The number of letters in each group are the bunch value.  When bunch is 0, password length is count.
              When  bunch  is 1, password length is twice count because every other character will be a dash.  The default bunch
              is 4.

       -l count
              The number of letters in the password string.  The default count is 16.  Overall password length  is  the  sum  of
              count plus the number of delimiters implied by bunch.

       -q     Quiet mode.  Exclude the MAC address on output.  This option can be used in scripts to return the password associ‐
              ated with a given MAC address.

       -v     Verbose mode.  Prefix each line with a ’0’ column.  The Atheros Production Test System (PTS) uses the first column
              of a password database file to indicate which addresses and passwords have already been used.

       -?,--help
              Print program help information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The  name  of a file that contains Ethernet address strings.  Individual address strings consist of 12 consecutive
              hexadecimal digits.  Addresses are seperated by whites space.  This allows multiple addresses on a line.  There is
              no line length limit.  Punctuation is not permitted; however, a hash (’#’) or semicolon (’;’) in any column starts
              comment text that continues to the end of that line.  An error in any input file terminates the  program  with  an
              error message.

EXAMPLES
       An example input file, mac.txt, is shown below.  Comment lines document the file.  Blank lines are permitted and multiple
       addresses appear on one line.  This file contains 5 MAC addresses.  Punctuation is not permitted within a MAC address.

          # =================================
          # unused MAC addresses;
          # ---------------------------------
          00b052000004
          00b052BABE33
          00b052BABE34 00b052CAFE05
          00b052CAFE01

       Another example input file, mac2.txt, appears below.  A hash (’#’) and a semi-colon  (’;’)  are  used  to  hide  selected
       addresses.   Hidden  addresses  are ignored because they are comments.  This file contains 7 addresses but only 5 will be
       recognized.

          002b88ffff00
          002b887fff00
          # 002b88660066
          002b88660067
          002b88660063 ; 002b8800FFFF
          002b88660066

       The following example reads the two files shown above and prints 10 addresses, 5 from each file,  with  associated  pass‐
       words.  Output appears on the console but it could be directed to a file.

          # mac2pwd mac.txt more.mac
          00B052000004 LBPL-NZSM-VPUC-XPLM
          00B052BABE33 KKDF-KLMC-JENV-NGFG
          00B052BABE34 FVPK-WQID-VVHY-ZHYQ
          00B052CAFE05 PCHK-EXLA-QEDY-DPJU
          00B052CAFE01 KDGB-ZVBQ-YLTF-ZCET
          002B88FFFF00 OIFX-KUHT-RUIN-MURF
          002B887FFF00 SPUU-KOJU-RXOA-ZORW
          002B88660067 BTQY-NMZL-WUNM-HSHW
          002B88660063 EJRX-AATI-YSMU-JWSG
          002B88660066 FOFC-LVAB-MTHH-TVNO

       The  following  example is the same but prints output suitable for input to the Qualcomm Atheros PTS because option -v is
       specified.  The output format is similar to that produced by the Qualcomm Atheros DB Builder Utility for Windows.

          # mac2pwd -v mac.txt more.mac
          0 00B052000004 LBPL-NZSM-VPUC-XPLM
          0 00B052BABE33 KKDF-KLMC-JENV-NGFG
          0 00B052BABE34 FVPK-WQID-VVHY-ZHYQ
          0 00B052CAFE05 PCHK-EXLA-QEDY-DPJU
          0 00B052CAFE01 KDGB-ZVBQ-YLTF-ZCET
          0 002B88FFFF00 OIFX-KUHT-RUIN-MURF
          0 002B887FFF00 SPUU-KOJU-RXOA-ZORW
          0 002B88660067 BTQY-NMZL-WUNM-HSHW
          0 002B88660063 EJRX-AATI-YSMU-JWSG
          0 002B88660066 FOFC-LVAB-MTHH-TVNO

       The following example omits the MAC address from the output for clandestine cases where one does not want  both  the  MAC
       address and the password to appear together.  It can also be used to generate random passwords for other purposes.

          # mac2pwd -q mac.txt more.mac
          LBPL-NZSM-VPUC-XPLM
          KKDF-KLMC-JENV-NGFG
          FVPK-WQID-VVHY-ZHYQ
          PCHK-EXLA-QEDY-DPJU
          KDGB-ZVBQ-YLTF-ZCET
          OIFX-KUHT-RUIN-MURF
          SPUU-KOJU-RXOA-ZORW
          BTQY-NMZL-WUNM-HSHW
          EJRX-AATI-YSMU-JWSG
