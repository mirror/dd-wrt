			Toolkit Programs 
			</h2></div></div></div><p>
			The Qualcomm Atheros <span class="application">Open Powerline Toolkit</span> is a collection of small, command line programs. Each program deals with some aspect of powerline device management. Programs can be combined, in various ways, using shell scripts, to perform sophisticated and complex tasks. With these program, one can identify chipset and firmware version, reset devices, flash devices, identify other powerline network devices, validate <code class="filename">*.pib</code> and <code class="filename">*.nvm</code> files, sniff <span class="trademark">HomePlug</span>® AV Ethernet frames, send generic Ethernet frames and so on. 
			</p><p>
			Program source code is designed to demonstrate device hardware and firmware features and to illustrate techniques for software developers and hardware engineers. The source code may be modified and distributed without obligation to Qualcomm Atheros; however Qualcomm Atheros would appreciate feedback concerning improvements to program useability, reliability or efficiency. Keep in mind that these tools, unlike some other tools, are intended to be simple and compact. 
			</p><p>
			Most programs in this toolkit start their life on Linux and are eventually ported to other environments. Consequently, not all programs are available in the Windows version of the toolkit but most of them are.
			</p><p>
			Program descriptions appear below in alphabetical order. Alternately, you may browse the latest program descriptions and source code <a class="ulink" href="toolkit.html" target="_top">here</a>.

				INT6400 Device Management
				</h3></div></div></div><p>
				Programs in this group are older versions that communicate with INT6x00 chipsets. Many still work on AR7x00 chipsets. The main difference is due to the higher PHY data rates on AR7x00 chipsets. The higher data rates must be expressed using 16-bits instead of 8-bits. Consequently, some MME formats have changed.
