mdustats(1)                                  Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                 mdustats(1)

NAME
       mdustats

SYNOPSIS
       mdustats [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Collect and display MDU traffic statisitcs using the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific VS_MDU_TRAFFIC_STATS message.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -c command
              An integer indicating the type of statistics to be collected and reported.  Permitted values  are  0  through  255
              decimal  but only 4 through 15 are valid at this time.  This option is mandatory because the default value of 0 is
              invalid.
               4 - retrieve traffic statistics on the slave side
               5 - retrieve traffic statistics (master TX/RX) collected on the master side
               6 - retrieve traffic statistics (slave TX/RX) collected on the master side
               7 - retrieve traffic statistics (master/slave TX/RX) collected on the master side
               8 - clear traffic statistics on the slave side
               9 - clear traffic statistics (master TX/RX) colleted on the master side
               10 - clear traffic statistics (slave TX/RX) collected on the master side
               11 - clear traffic statistics (master/slave TX/RX) collected on the master side
               12 - retrieve then clear traffic statistics collected on the slave side
               13 - retrieve then clear traffic statistics (master TX/RX) collected on the master side
               14 - retrieve then clear traffic statistics (slave TX/RX) collected on the master side
               15 - retrieve then clear traffic statistics (master/slave TX/RX) collected on the master side

       -s session
              The session identifier used to associate request/confirm message pairs.  Valid identifiers are 0 through 255.  The
              default is 0.

       -t milliseconds
              Read  timeout  in  milliseconds.   Values  range  from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is the maximum time allowed for a
              response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -u unit
              The slave unit number.  This is the same as the slave Terminal Equipment Identifier or TEI.   Valid  unit  numbers
              are  0  through  255.   Unit  0 is the default.  This option is ignored when option -c specified any of the &quot;slave
              side&quot; commands 4, 8 or 12.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.

       -x     Cause the program to exit on the first error instead  of  continuing  with  remaining  iterations,  operations  or
              devices.   Normally,  the program reports errors and moves on to the next operation, iteration or device depending
              on the command line.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The Ethernet hardware address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be  specified  on  the  command
              line.   If  more  than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.  The default
              address is local.  as explained in the DEVICES section.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet hardware, or Media Access Control (MAC), addresses.  Device addresses are expressed as  12
       hexadecimal digits (0123456789ABCDEFabcdef) in upper, lower or mixed case.  Individual octets may be separated by colons,
       for  clarity,  but  not  all  octets  need  to  be  seperated.   For  example,  &quot;00b052000001&quot;,  &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot;  and
       &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       These symbolic addresses are recognized by this program and may be used instead of the actual address value.

       all    Equivalent to &quot;broadcast&quot;, described next.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for the standard Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local, remote or
              foreign will respond to this address.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.   All  local
              Atheros  devices  will  recognize  this  address  but remote and foreign devices will not.  A remote device is any
              device at the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

REFERENCES
       See the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information about MDU powerline  configu‐
       ration and the VS_MDU_TRAFFIC_STATS message type.

DISCLAIMER
       Atheros HomePlug AV Vendor Specific Management Message structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL
       USA.  Consequently, public information may not be available.  Qualcomm Atheros  reserves  the  right  to  modify  message
       structure or content in future firmware releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example collects and displays MDU traffic statistics on the slave side of the local device because option
       -c is 4.  The local device is implicit because no device is specified on the command line.

          # mdustats -c 4

       The next example collects and displays MDU traffic statistics for slave 2 on the master side of device  00:b0:52:9F:E0:14
       because option -c is 5 and option -s is 2.  The master device is explicit in this example.

          # mdustats -c 5 -u 2 00b0529FE014
