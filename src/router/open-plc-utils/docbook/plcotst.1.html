plcotst(1)                                   Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                  plcotst(1)

NAME
       plcotst - PLC One-Time Self-Test Manager

SYNOPSIS
       plcotst [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Manage the PLC One-Time Self-Test feature on Atheros powerline devices.  Normally, selftest is performed once, on startup
       at the factory, but it can also be configured and run again using this utility.   Selftest  results  are  stored  by  the
       firmware  and  can be read using this utility, as well.  The selftest is configured when configuration options are speci‐
       fied on the command line; otherwise, selftest results are read or cleared.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -c  version Configuration version number.  Permitted values are 0 through 255.  The default is 0.  This option applies to
       both selftest configuration and selftest results.

       -C     Clear stored selftest results.  This option clears stored selftest results.  This option implies selftest  results
              and supercedes options -d, -f, -m, -r and -R, if present on the command line.

       -d seconds
              Delay  selftest  after  reboot.   Permitted delay times are 0 through UINT_MAX seconds.  The default is 0 seconds.
              This option implies selftest configuration and supercedes option -C, if present on the command line.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -f count
              Run  the  flash  memory selftest count times.  Valid values are 0 through UINT_MAX.  The default is 0 which effec‐
              tively suppresses the test.  This option implies selftest configuration and supercedes option -C,  if  present  on
              the command line.

       -m count
              Run  the  memory  selftest  count  times.  Valid values are 0 through UINT_MAX.  The default is 0 which suppresses
              effectively the test.  This option implies selftest configuration and supercedes option -C, if present on the com‐
              mand line.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -r flag
              Run  selftest  after reboot.  Permitted values are 0 through 255.  Expected values are 0 for false and 1 for true.
              The default is 1.  If the memory test count and flash test count are both 0 no testing will occur  when  the  time
              comes.  This option implies selftest configuration and supercedes option -C, if present on the command line.

       -R flag
              Reset device after selftest.  Permitted values are 0 through 255.  Expected values are 0 for false and 1 for true.
              The default is 0.  This option applies to selftest configuration only and supercedes option -C, if present on  the
              command line.

       -t timeout
              Read  timeout  in  milliseconds.   Values  range  from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is the maximum time allowed for a
              response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets which  can
              be saved as text files for reference.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  Ethernet  hardware  address  of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified on the command
              line.  If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in  turn.   The  default
              address is local.  as explained in the DEVICES section.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example prints stored test results for the local device on stdout because no options are specified on the
       command line.

          # plcotst

       The next example prints stored test results for remote device 00:B0:52:BA:BE:DE and clears them afterwards.

          # plcotst -C

       The next example configures the PLC selftest to wait 5 seconds before execution because option -d is  present.   It  also
       configures the selftest to reset the device after execution because option -R is present

          # plcotst -d 5 -R
