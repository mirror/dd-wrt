hpavkeys(1)                                  Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                 hpavkeys(1)

NAME
       hpavkeys - HomePlug AV Key Generator

SYNOPSIS
       hpavkeys [options] file [file] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Convert  blocks  of  phrases to encrypted HomePlug AV keys.  Phrases are read from one or more files, converted to either
       Device Access Keys, Networks Membership Keys or Network Identification Keys and printed on stdout.  By default, only keys
       are printed, one per line, but both keys and phrases can be printed, one pair per line.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

BACKGROUND
       HomePlug AV technology uses 16-byte binary values, called &quot;keys&quot;, for various purposes such  as  identity  and  security.
       Three  keys of interest to users are the Device Access Key (DAK), the Network Memership Key (NMK) and Network Identifica‐
       tion Key (NID).  Their purpose is described in the HomePlug AV Specification.

       The HomePlug AV Specification explains how to generate 16-btye binary DAK, NMK and NID values using the SHA-256 algorithm
       to hash user-supplied ASCII strings, called &quot;pass phrases&quot; in the specification.  HomePlug AV compliant pass phrases have
       from 12 to 64 7-bit ASCII character values in the range 0x20 to 0x7F.  In some cases, a specified 8-byte salt is added to
       the  pass  phrase  before computing the 32-byte hash value.  In all cases, the computed hash is then rehashed a specified
       number of times to produce the final 32-byte value.  The HomePlug AV key is the lower 16-bytes of that value.

       Keys can be any 16-byte binary value but binary values are difficult to remember.  HomePlug  AV  compliant  applications,
       like the Qualcomm Atheros Device Manager, ask users for a pass phrase that is converted to a 16-byte binary value using a
       standard hashing algorithm.  In principle, no two phrases will produce the same  key  and  it  would  be  computationally
       expensive to derive the pass phrase given the key.  Although HomePlug AV software deals directly with the key, users need
       only remember the pass phrase in order to reproduce the key.

OPTIONS
       -D     Uses HomePlug AV rules to compute Device Access Keys (DAK) from pass phrases read from file or stdin.  A DAK is 16
              bytes  expressed  as  32 hexadecimal digits.  This option over-rides any -M and -N options previously specified on
              the command line.

       -e     Enforce HomePlug AV length and content rules for phrases.  Non-compliant phrases are reported and  ignored.   Com‐
              pliant  phrases  are 12 to 64 7-bit ASCII characters in the range 0x20 (SP) through 0x7F (DEL).  Essentially, this
              includes any character that can be typed on a standard US or UK keyboard, excluding horizontal tab (HT).  Be aware
              that  some  command shells intercept and act on special characters instead of passing them to the application.  In
              such cases, you may need to include meta characters.

       -L level
              Set security level.  The security level is encoded into the NID.  Level 0 enables pusbutton pairing.  Level 1 dis‐
              ables it.  This option has no effect unless a NID is computed.

       -M     Uses HomePlug AV rules to compute Network Membership Keys (NMK) from pass phrases read from file or stdin.  An NMK
              is 16 bytes expressed as 32 hexadecimal characters.  This option over-rides any -D or -N options previsously spec‐
              ified on the command line.

       -N     Uses HomePlug AV rules to compute Network Identification Keys (NID) from pass phrases read from file or stdin.  An
              NID is 7 bytes expressed as 14 hexadecimal digits.  This  option  over-rides  any  -D  or  -M  options  previously
              specified on the command line.

       -p     Print  the  password, or pass phrase, used to generate each key after each key on stdout.  One single space seper‐
              ates the pass phrase from the key string.  The pass  phrase  consists  of  all  subsequent  characters,  including
              spaces, appearing up to the end of the line.  Without this option, only the keys are printed.

       -q     Enable quiet mode which, for this application, has no effect.  This behavior has changed from earlier program ver‐
              sions.

       -v     Enable verbose mode which, for this application, prints the input  phrase  after  each  key.   This  behavior  has
              changed from earlier program versions.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   Any  valid filename.  Each file on the command line is read in turn and output is written to stdout, much like the
              cat utility.  Input is read from the console when no filenames are specified.

EXAMPLES
       The following command reads file example.keys and prints the SHA256 key for each phrase in that file.  An SHA256  key  is
       128  bits  or 32 bytes expressed as 32 hexadecimal digits.  SHA256 keys are the default output when no key type is speci‐
       fied.  SHA256 is a public domain standard, not a HomePlug AV standard.

       The following command reads file example.keys and prints the DAK for each phrase in that file.  Input phrases are checked
       for  HomePlugAV compliance and illegal phrases are reported then ignored.  A legal HomePlug pass phrase is 12 to 64 char‐
       acters consisting of ASCII characters ’ ’ through ’~’.  Essentially, these are the only characters that one can enter  on
       a standard English keyboard.

       The  following  example  reads  the  same file as above but prints the NMK for each phrase, instead of the DAK.  The keys
       printed here have different values because the HomePlug AV Specification requires different hash algorithms for  the  DAK
       and NMK.  Don’t mix them up.

       The  following  command reads the same file as above but prints the pass phrase because the -v option is specified.  Keys
       are printed as 32 hex digits then one space then the phrase. Spaces are significant within the  phrase.  Printed  phrases
       start in column 34 and continue to the end of the line.

TIPS&amp;TRICKS
       The  following  example  illustrates an unusual case where passwords start with dash (&quot;-&quot;).  Program hpavkey assumes that
       the dash is an option prefix which is incorrect in this case.  An error occurs because option -H is illegal.

          # hpavkey -vM -HomePlugAV -HomePlugAV123
          hpavkey: Operation canceled: Option ’H’ has no meaning

       One solution is to insert the keys verbatim in a password file, in this case password.txt, then run program  hpavkeys  on
       that file.

          # hpavkeys -vM password.txt
