NAME
       efsu - Ethernet Frame Send Utility

SYNOPSIS
       efsu [options] file [file] [...]

       efsu [options] [&lt;stdin]

DESCRIPTION
       Sends custom Ethernet frames over a specific host Ethernet interface.

       A  frame is specified as a text stream of hexadecimal octets read from one or more frame description files or from stdin.
       Each octet is converted to a binary byte, buffered and transmitted over the network on the specified host interface.  The
       program  assumes  that  frames are valid and will transmit whatever you specify, right or wrong.  The program only checks
       minimum and maximum frame length.

       Frame descriptions are stored as plain text files.  Multiple frames may be specified in one file by separating them  with
       a semicolon.  All descriptions in a file are read and sent immediately but multiple files may be specified on the command
       line and options allow pauses between files, command line repetition and pauses between command line iterations.

       A frame descriptions is a continuous stream of hexadecimal digits.  Intervening text, punctuation, white space  and  com‐
       ments  are  discarded.  Hex characters inside script-style, C-style or C++-style comments are ignored.  Script-style com‐
       ments include all characters between a hash (’#’) and the next newline or EOF.  C-style  and  C++-style  comments  follow
       normal  language  rules.   Comments may be used to document frame descriptions or hide frame segments.  In the end, there
       must be an even number of hex digits that represent 60 to 1518 octets;

OPTIONS
       -d address
              Replace the destination Ethernet address of each transmitted frame with  the  option  argument.   The  destination
              address  consists of 12 hex digits in upper, lower or mixed case.  Octets may be seperated with colons for clarity
              but colons are not required.

       -e ethertype
              Echo received frames having ethertype.  This effectively filters received frames but does not  filter  transmitted
              frames.   The  ethertype  is expressed in hexadecimal without the &quot;0x&quot; prefix.  The keyword &quot;hp10&quot; can be used for
              887B and keyword &quot;hpav&quot; can be used for 88E1.

       -h     Replace the source address of each transmitted frame with the Ethernet address of the host interface used to  send
              the  frame.   This allows frames to be sent correctly from any host interface.  Use option -i to specify an inter‐
              face.

       -i interface
              The host interface used to send frames.  The default is &quot;eth1&quot; because most people use &quot;eth0&quot; as  their  principle
              network  connection; however, if the string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined in the environment then it will over-ride the program
              default.  Any interface specified on the command line will over-ride the default.

       -l count
              Repeat command line count times by re-sending all files each time.  The default is 1.

       -p seconds
              Pause between each file on the command line.  The default is 0 seconds.

       -t timer
              Read timeout in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is  the  maximum  time  allowed  for  a
              response.  The default is 50 milliseconds.

       -v     Dumps  transmitted  frames on stdout as they are sent.  If an Ethertype was specified using option -e the received
              frames having that Ethertype will also be dumped.

       -w seconds
              Wait between command line iterations.  The default is 0 seconds.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The name of a file containing one or more frame specifications.  When  more  than  one  file  is  specified,  efsu
              behaves  like the cat utility by reading and sending each file in turn.  The program makes no assumptions based on
              filename or extension and enforces no filename conventions; however, giving  frame  description  files  the  *.hex
              extension  is  a  good  convention.   Some  toolkit distributions include example .hex files in the source folder.
              These files are not needed for proper execution and may be deleted.

NOTES
       One way to create a frame description file is to cut-and-paste output from a packet sniffer program and discard the  line
       numbers and ASCII text columns.  You can then break out selected frame segments onto new lines and insert comments.

EXAMPLES
       For example, a simple file might look like:

          #!/usr/local/bin/efsu -ieth0
          # file: abc.hex
          # =====================================
          # this is an example frame description;
          # -------------------------------------
          00 B0 52 00 00 01
          // 00 B0 52 BE DE 73
          00 E0 45 DA DA 07
          88 E1
          /* content */
          00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
          00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
          00000000 0000 00 /* control byte */ 00
          00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
          00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
          00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

       The bang path permits direct execution of the file if 1) efsu is installed in the bang path directory, 2) the description
       file has execute permissions and 3) the user has execute privileges for that file.  The script-style,  C++-style  and  C-
       style  comments are ignored along with any white space.  Only the hexadecimal octets are read and sent.  Since the number
       of octets exceeds 60 and the number of digits is even, efsu will report no errors and send the packet.  There is no guar‐
       antee that this packet is valid.

       Assuming  the  above  file is named abc.hex, we can transmit the file over the network as an Ethernet frame with the next
       command.  A hexadecimal dump of the transmitted frame appears on the console because option -v is present.

          # efsu abc.hex -v
          00000000 00 B0 52 00 00 01 00 E0 45 DA DA 07 88 E1 00 00 ..R.....E.......
          00000010 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000020 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000030 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................

       Since every host interface has a different hardware address, one can replace the source  address  of  transmitted  frames
       with  the actual host interface address using option -h.  Observe that the original source address has been replaced with
       that of the local host interface used to transmit the frame.

          # efsu abc.hex -vh
          00000000 00 B0 52 00 00 01 00 0F EA 10 D5 1C 88 E1 00 00 ..R.............
          00000010 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000020 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000030 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000040 00 00 00 00 00 00                               ......

       You can also direct the frame to another device using option -d.  Observe that the original destination address has  been
       replaced with the one specified on the command line.

          # efsu abc.hex -vhd 00b052beef01
          00000000 00 B0 52 BE EF 01 00 0F EA 10 D5 1C 88 E1 00 00 ..R.............
          00000010 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000020 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000030 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000040 00 00 00 00 00 00                               ......
