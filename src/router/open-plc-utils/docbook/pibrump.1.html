pibrump(1)                                   Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                  pibrump(1)

NAME
       pibrump - Classification Rule Dump Utility

SYNOPSIS
       pibrump [options] file [file] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Read  classifier  rules stored in a PIB file and print them on stdout in a format similar to the command line for program
       int6krule.  The output can be read by program pibruin for insertion into another PIB file.  The program name is short for
       &quot;rule dump&quot;.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -q     Suppresses comments used to group classification rules.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.  Presently, this option has no effect.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The name of a valid Atheros runtime parameter file.  The file is not modified by  this  program.   The  file  must
              exist  and  be a valid runtime parameter file or errors will occur.  By convention, runtime parameter files have a
              .pib extention but this program does not enforce that convention.

DISCLAIMER
       PIB file structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.  Consequently, public information is not
       available.  Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to change the file structure or content in future firmware releases with‐
       out any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.

EXAMPLES
       The following example prints the classifier rules stored in file abc.pib on stdout.  Individual rules are  printed  in  a
       format that is essentially the same as that used to enter rules using program int6krule.  Rules are grouped by their cat‐
       egory using comments.

          &gt; pibrump abc.pib
          # auto connection rules:
          StripRX Any VLANID Is 5 VLANID Is 10 VLANID Is 15 add perm
          StripRX Any VLANID Is 20 add perm
          CAP1 Any VLANID Is 5 VLANID Is 10 VLANID Is 15 add perm
          # priority mapping rules:
          CAP1 Any VLANID Is 20 add perm
          DropRX Any VLANID Is 25 add perm

       The next example prints the classifier rules stored in file def.pib but output is a huge disappointment because there are
       no rules, much like a Rambo movie.

          &gt; pibrump def.pib
          # auto connection rules:
          # priority mapping rules:

       The  next example shows a case where the the user has selected two rules from the first example and used them as input to
       program int6krule.  There is no PIB file involved here because an MME is sent directly to the device  with  each  command
       and the device will reset each time.  There are times when you may not want to set rules this way.

          &gt; int6krule StripRX Any VLANID Is 5 VLANID Is 10 VLANID Is 15 add perm
          # int6krule CAP1 Any VLANID Is 20 add perm

       The  next  example  reads classification rules from file abc.pib and write them to file rules.txt instead of the console.
       The rules are then read from file rules.txt and written into file def.pib using program pibruin.  This procedure  can  be
       used to distribute a given rule set to other toolkit users.

          &gt; pibrump abc.def &gt; rules.txt
          # pibruin &lt; rules.txt def.pib

       The  next  example reads classification rules directly from file abc.pib and writes them directly into file def.pib using
       program pibruin.

          &gt; pibrump abc.pib | pibruin def.pib
