int6kf(1)                                    Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                   int6kf(1)

NAME
       int6kf - INT6300 Flash Utility for Linux

SYNOPSIS
       int6kf [options] -C file -N file -P file

DESCRIPTION
       This program is deprecated.  Use int6kboot when downloading firmware 3.3.4 or later on INT6300 devices or later.

       Download  and  start  runtime firmware on a local Atheros powerline device that is in bootloader mode.  A device stays in
       bootloader mode when it cannot load firmware from NVRAM.  That can happen because there is no NVRAM or because the  NVRAM
       is  blank  or corrupted.  The bootloader only understands a subset of Atheros message types and cannot flash NVRAM.  This
       program uses that subset to download runtime firmware and start execution.  Optionally, it will proceed  to  flash  NVRAM
       after the firmware has started.

       Booting  a device is a two part operation.  The first part downloads SDRAM configuration parameters then download runtime
       firmware and parameters into SDRAM and starts the firmware.  The second part downloads  runtime  firmare  and  parameters
       (again)  into scratch buffers and instructs the firmware to write them into to NVRAM.  This program can perform the first
       part alone or the first then the second part but not the second part alone.  The second part can be performed alone using
       program int6k.

       This  program  is  part of the Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for compilation and installation instruc‐
       tions.

OPTIONS
       -a     Wait until device sends a VS_HOST_ACTION.IND before downloading SDRAM configuration, firmware and PIB.

       -C filename
              Read the named SDRAM configuration file and write it to the device.  This option and argument are  required.   Any
              file  having  an invalid SDRAM configuration file format will be rejected.  No assumptions are made based on file‐
              name and no filename conventions are enforced.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -F[F]  Write  previously downloaded MAC and PIB to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM.  Adding a second F here or another -F anywhere
              on the command line will force-flash a blank or corrupted NVRAM.  Firmware loaded from  NVRAM  will  treat  force-
              flash as an error.  This option can be used to create factory settings but cannot be used to change them once cre‐
              ated.  Subsequent use creates and updates operational settings that can be erased using  a  factory  reset.   This
              option is executed after all others on the command line, except for the -R option.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this interface and only reponses received via this
              interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their  principle  network
              connection;  however,  if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.
              This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -N filename
              Read the named NVM file and write it to the device.  This option and argument are required.  Any  file  having  an
              invalid  NVM  file format will be rejected.  No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions
              are enforced.

       -P filename
              Read the named PIB file and write it to the device.  This option and argument are required.  Any  file  having  an
              invalid  PIB  file format will be rejected.  No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions
              are enforced.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -t timer
              Read timeout or capture period in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This value  has  different
              effects on Linux and Windows.  On Linux, where native raw sockets are used, this is the maximum time allowed for a
              response and so larger values should not affect performance.  On Windows, where WinPcap is used, this is the  time
              allotted  for  packet  capture  and  so  larger values will certainly affect performance.  The default is shown in
              brackets on the program menu.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       None.

EXAMPLES
       The -C, -N and -P options are always required.  Their order is not important.  Notice  that  no  MAC  address  is  needed
       because devices use address 00:B0:52:00:00:01, the program default address, when in bootloader mode.

          int6kf -C test.cfg -N test.nvm -P test.pib
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write SDRAM Configuration
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Start Firmware
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Started.

       Downloads  SDRAM  configuration  file test.cfg with VS_SET_SDRAM then firmware from file test.nvm with VS_WR_MEM then PIB
       from file test.pib then starts firmware execution with VS_ST_MAC.  This operation is common on flash-less systems.

          int6kf -C test.cfg -N test.nvm -P test.pib -F
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write SDRAM Configuration
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Start Firmware
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Started.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write MAC as module
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write PIB as module
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Flash Device
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Flashed.

       Perform the same actions as before with some extra steps.  After starting firmware execution, the same firmware  and  PIB
       are  downloaded again, using VS_WR_MOD instead of VS_WR_MEM, and written to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM with force.  The force
       option is only recognized by firmware that has been started by the bootloader and will  fail  when  no  flash  memory  is
       present.
