This is experimental software. There are known bugs and certainly even
many more yet unknown problems. Internal and external interfaces may
still change every once in a while. Use at your own risk.

Please see  http://linux-atm.sourceforge.net/  for a list of features
supported by ATM on Linux.

If you're just looking for the device drivers: you may find what
you're looking for under src/extra/drivers.  Most are already in
the mainstream kernel or, for those which are not integrated, visit
http://linux-atm.sourceforge.net/info.php

For usage and installation instructions, please read the "ATM on Linux
HOWTO" in the doc/ directory.  The README in that directory explains
how to generate alternative document types of the documentation.

For known restrictions and bugs, please read the file BUGS.
