.SH "NAME"
.P
rrsync \- a script to setup restricted rsync users via ssh logins
.P
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.P
.nf
rrsync [-ro|-rw] [-munge] [-no-del] [-no-lock] DIR
.fi
.P
The single non-option argument specifies the restricted \fIDIR\fP to use. It can be
relative to the user's home directory or an absolute path.
.P
The online version of this man page (that includes cross-linking of topics)
is available at https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rrsync.1.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.P
A user's ssh login can be restricted to only allow the running of an rsync
transfer in one of two easy ways: forcing the running of the rrsync script
or forcing the running of an rsync daemon-over-ssh command.
.P
To use the rrsync script, edit the user's \fB~/.ssh/authorized_keys\fP file and add
a prefix like one of the following (followed by a space) in front of each
ssh-key line that should be restricted:
.RS 4
.P
.nf
command="rrsync DIR"
command="rrsync -ro DIR"
command="rrsync -munge -no-del DIR"
.fi
.RE
.P
Then, ensure that the rrsync script has your desired option restrictions. You
may want to copy the script to a local bin dir with a unique name if you want
to have multiple configurations. One or more rrsync options can be specified
prior to the \fIDIR\fP if you want to further restrict the transfer.
.P
To use an rsync daemon setup, edit the user's \fB~/.ssh/authorized_keys\fP file and
add a prefix like one of the following (followed by a space) in front of each
ssh-key line that should be restricted:
.RS 4
.P
.nf
command="rsync --server --daemon ."
command="rsync --server --daemon --config=/PATH/TO/rsyncd.conf ."
.fi
.RE
.P
Then, ensure that the rsyncd.conf file is created with one or more module names
with the appropriate path and option restrictions.  If rsync's
\fB\-\-config\fP option is omitted, it defaults to \fB~/rsyncd.conf\fP.
See the \fBrsyncd.conf\fP man page for details of how to configure an rsync daemon.
.P
When using rrsync, there can be just one restricted dir per authorized key.  A
daemon setup, on the other hand, allows multiple module names inside the config
file, each one with its own path setting.
.P
The remainder of this man page is dedicated to using the rrsync script.
.P
.SH "OPTIONS"
.P
.IP "\fB\-ro\fP"
Allow only reading from the DIR. Implies \fB\-no-del\fP and
\fB\-no-lock\fP.
.IP "\fB\-wo\fP"
Allow only writing to the DIR.
.IP "\fB\-munge\fP"
Enable rsync's \fB\-\-munge-links\fP on the server side.
.IP "\fB\-no-del\fP"
Disable rsync's \fB\-\-delete*\fP and \fB\-\-remove*\fP options.
.IP "\fB\-no-lock\fP"
Avoid the single-run (per-user) lock check.  Useful with \fB\-munge\fP.
.IP "\fB\-help\fP, \fB\-h\fP"
Output this help message and exit.
.P
.SH "SECURITY RESTRICTIONS"
.P
The rrsync script validates the path arguments it is sent to try to restrict
them to staying within the specified DIR.
.P
The rrsync script rejects rsync's \fB\-\-copy-links\fP option (by
default) so that a copy cannot dereference a symlink within the DIR to get to a
file outside the DIR.
.P
The rrsync script rejects rsync's \fB\-\-protect-args\fP (\fB\-s\fP) option
because it would allow options to be sent to the server-side that the script
cannot check.  If you want to support \fB\-\-protect-args\fP, use a daemon-over-ssh
setup.
.P
The rrsync script accepts just a subset of rsync's options that the real rsync
uses when running the server command.  A few extra convenience options are also
included to help it to interact with BackupPC and accept some convenient user
overrides.
.P
The script (or a copy of it) can be manually edited if you want it to customize
the option handling.
.P
.SH "EXAMPLES"
