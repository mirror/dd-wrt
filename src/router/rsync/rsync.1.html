<h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION<a href="#DESCRIPTION" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool.  It can copy
locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or to/from a remote rsync
daemon.  It offers a large number of options that control every aspect of its
behavior and permit very flexible specification of the set of files to be
copied.  It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the
amount of data sent over the network by sending only the differences between
the source files and the existing files in the destination.  Rsync is widely
used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday
use.</p>
<p>Rsync finds files that need to be transferred using a &quot;quick check&quot; algorithm
(by default) that looks for files that have changed in size or in last-modified
time.  Any changes in the other preserved attributes (as requested by options)
are made on the destination file directly when the quick check indicates that
the file's data does not need to be updated.</p>
<p>Some of the additional features of rsync are:</p>
<ul>
<li>support for copying links, devices, owners, groups, and permissions</li>
<li>exclude and exclude-from options similar to GNU tar</li>
<li>a CVS exclude mode for ignoring the same files that CVS would ignore</li>
<li>can use any transparent remote shell, including ssh or rsh</li>
<li>does not require super-user privileges</li>
<li>pipelining of file transfers to minimize latency costs</li>
<li>support for anonymous or authenticated rsync daemons (ideal for mirroring)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="GENERAL">GENERAL<a href="#GENERAL" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>Rsync copies files either to or from a remote host, or locally on the current
host (it does not support copying files between two remote hosts).</p>
<p>There are two different ways for rsync to contact a remote system: using a
remote-shell program as the transport (such as ssh or rsh) or contacting an
rsync daemon directly via TCP.  The remote-shell transport is used whenever the
source or destination path contains a single colon (:) separator after a host
specification.  Contacting an rsync daemon directly happens when the source or
destination path contains a double colon (::) separator after a host
specification, OR when an rsync:// URL is specified (see also the <a href="#USING_RSYNC-DAEMON_FEATURES_VIA_A_REMOTE-SHELL_CONNECTION">USING
RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION</a> section for an
exception to this latter rule).</p>
<p>As a special case, if a single source arg is specified without a destination,
the files are listed in an output format similar to &quot;<code>ls -l</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>As expected, if neither the source or destination path specify a remote host,
the copy occurs locally (see also the <a href="#opt--list-only"><code>--list-only</code></a> option).</p>
<p>Rsync refers to the local side as the client and the remote side as the server.
Don't confuse server with an rsync daemon.  A daemon is always a server, but a
server can be either a daemon or a remote-shell spawned process.</p>
<h2 id="SETUP">SETUP<a href="#SETUP" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>See the file README.md for installation instructions.</p>
<p>Once installed, you can use rsync to any machine that you can access via a
remote shell (as well as some that you can access using the rsync daemon-mode
protocol).  For remote transfers, a modern rsync uses ssh for its
communications, but it may have been configured to use a different remote shell
by default, such as rsh or remsh.</p>
<p>You can also specify any remote shell you like, either by using the <a href="#opt-e"><code>-e</code></a>
command line option, or by setting the <a href="#RSYNC_RSH"><code>RSYNC_RSH</code></a> environment variable.</p>
<p>Note that rsync must be installed on both the source and destination machines.</p>
<h2 id="USAGE">USAGE<a href="#USAGE" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>You use rsync in the same way you use rcp.  You must specify a source and a
destination, one of which may be remote.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to explain the syntax is with some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -t *.c foo:src/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This would transfer all files matching the pattern <code>*.c</code> from the current
directory to the directory src on the machine foo.  If any of the files already
exist on the remote system then the rsync remote-update protocol is used to
update the file by sending only the differences in the data.  Note that the
expansion of wildcards on the command-line (<code>*.c</code>) into a list of files is
handled by the shell before it runs rsync and not by rsync itself (exactly the
same as all other Posix-style programs).</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -avz foo:src/bar /data/tmp
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This would recursively transfer all files from the directory src/bar on the
machine foo into the /data/tmp/bar directory on the local machine.  The files
are transferred in archive mode, which ensures that symbolic links, devices,
attributes, permissions, ownerships, etc. are preserved in the transfer.
Additionally, compression will be used to reduce the size of data portions of
the transfer.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -avz foo:src/bar/ /data/tmp
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>A trailing slash on the source changes this behavior to avoid creating an
additional directory level at the destination.  You can think of a trailing /
on a source as meaning &quot;copy the contents of this directory&quot; as opposed to
&quot;copy the directory by name&quot;, but in both cases the attributes of the
containing directory are transferred to the containing directory on the
destination.  In other words, each of the following commands copies the files
in the same way, including their setting of the attributes of /dest/foo:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av /src/foo /dest
rsync -av /src/foo/ /dest/foo
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note also that host and module references don't require a trailing slash to
copy the contents of the default directory.  For example, both of these copy
the remote directory's contents into &quot;/dest&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av host: /dest
rsync -av host::module /dest
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also use rsync in local-only mode, where both the source and
destination don't have a ':' in the name.  In this case it behaves like an
improved copy command.</p>
<p>Finally, you can list all the (listable) modules available from a particular
rsync daemon by leaving off the module name:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync somehost.mydomain.com::
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="COPYING_TO_A_DIFFERENT_NAME">COPYING TO A DIFFERENT NAME<a href="#COPYING_TO_A_DIFFERENT_NAME" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>When you want to copy a directory to a different name, use a trailing slash on
the source directory to put the contents of the directory into any destination
directory you like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -ai foo/ bar/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Rsync also has the ability to customize a destination file's name when copying
a single item.  The rules for this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The transfer list must consist of a single item (either a file or an empty
directory)</li>
<li>The final element of the destination path must not exist as a directory</li>
<li>The destination path must not have been specified with a trailing slash</li>
</ul>
<p>Under those circumstances, rsync will set the name of the destination's single
item to the last element of the destination path.  Keep in mind that it is best
to only use this idiom when copying a file and use the above trailing-slash
idiom when copying a directory.</p>
<p>The following example copies the <code>foo.c</code> file as <code>bar.c</code> in the <code>save</code> dir
(assuming that <code>bar.c</code> isn't a directory):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -ai src/foo.c save/bar.c
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The single-item copy rule might accidentally bite you if you unknowingly copy a
single item and specify a destination dir that doesn't exist (without using a
trailing slash).  For example, if <code>src/*.c</code> matches one file and <code>save/dir</code>
doesn't exist, this will confuse you by naming the destination file <code>save/dir</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -ai src/*.c save/dir
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To prevent such an accident, either make sure the destination dir exists or
specify the destination path with a trailing slash:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -ai src/*.c save/dir/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="SORTED_TRANSFER_ORDER">SORTED TRANSFER ORDER<a href="#SORTED_TRANSFER_ORDER" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>Rsync always sorts the specified filenames into its internal transfer list.
This handles the merging together of the contents of identically named
directories, makes it easy to remove duplicate filenames. It can, however,
confuse someone when the files are transferred in a different order than what
was given on the command-line.</p>
<p>If you need a particular file to be transferred prior to another, either
separate the files into different rsync calls, or consider using
<a href="#opt--delay-updates"><code>--delay-updates</code></a> (which doesn't affect the sorted transfer order, but
does make the final file-updating phase happen much more rapidly).</p>
<h2 id="MULTI-HOST_SECURITY">MULTI-HOST SECURITY<a href="#MULTI-HOST_SECURITY" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>Rsync takes steps to ensure that the file requests that are shared in a
transfer are protected against various security issues.  Most of the potential
problems arise on the receiving side where rsync takes steps to ensure that the
list of files being transferred remains within the bounds of what was
requested.</p>
<p>Toward this end, rsync 3.1.2 and later have aborted when a file list contains
an absolute or relative path that tries to escape out of the top of the
transfer.  Also, beginning with version 3.2.5, rsync does two more safety
checks of the file list to (1) ensure that no extra source arguments were added
into the transfer other than those that the client requested and (2) ensure
that the file list obeys the exclude rules that were sent to the sender.</p>
<p>For those that don't yet have a 3.2.5 client rsync (or those that want to be
extra careful), it is safest to do a copy into a dedicated destination
directory for the remote files when you don't trust the remote host.  For
example, instead of doing an rsync copy into your home directory:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -aiv host1:dir1 ~
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Dedicate a &quot;host1-files&quot; dir to the remote content:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -aiv host1:dir1 ~/host1-files
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>See the <a href="#opt--trust-sender"><code>--trust-sender</code></a> option for additional details.</p>
<p>CAUTION: it is not particularly safe to use rsync to copy files from a
case-preserving filesystem to a case-ignoring filesystem.  If you must perform
such a copy, you should either disable symlinks via <code>--no-links</code> or enable the
munging of symlinks via <a href="#opt--munge-links"><code>--munge-links</code></a> (and make sure you use the
right local or remote option).  This will prevent rsync from doing potentially
dangerous things if a symlink name overlaps with a file or directory. It does
not, however, ensure that you get a full copy of all the files (since that may
not be possible when the names overlap). A potentially better solution is to
list all the source files and create a safe list of filenames that you pass to
the <a href="#opt--files-from"><code>--files-from</code></a> option.  Any files that conflict in name would need
to be copied to different destination directories using more than one copy.</p>
<p>While a copy of a case-ignoring filesystem to a case-ignoring filesystem can
work out fairly well, if no <code>--delete-during</code> or <code>--delete-before</code> option is
active, rsync can potentially update an existing file on the receiving side
without noticing that the upper-/lower-case of the filename should be changed
to match the sender.</p>
<h2 id="ADVANCED_USAGE">ADVANCED USAGE<a href="#ADVANCED_USAGE" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>The syntax for requesting multiple files from a remote host is done by
specifying additional remote-host args in the same style as the first, or with
the hostname omitted.  For instance, all these work:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -aiv host:file1 :file2 host:file{3,4} /dest/
rsync -aiv host::modname/file{1,2} host::modname/extra /dest/
rsync -aiv host::modname/first ::extra-file{1,2} /dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that a daemon connection only supports accessing one module per copy
command, so if the start of a follow-up path doesn't begin with the
modname of the first path, it is assumed to be a path in the module (such as
the extra-file1 &amp; extra-file2 that are grabbed above).</p>
<p>Really old versions of rsync (2.6.9 and before) only allowed specifying one
remote-source arg, so some people have instead relied on the remote-shell
performing space splitting to break up an arg into multiple paths. Such
unintuitive behavior is no longer supported by default (though you can request
it, as described below).</p>
<p>Starting in 3.2.4, filenames are passed to a remote shell in such a way as to
preserve the characters you give it. Thus, if you ask for a file with spaces
in the name, that's what the remote rsync looks for:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -aiv host:'a simple file.pdf' /dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you use scripts that have been written to manually apply extra quoting to
the remote rsync args (or to require remote arg splitting), you can ask rsync
to let your script handle the extra escaping.  This is done by either adding
the <a href="#opt--old-args"><code>--old-args</code></a> option to the rsync runs in the script (which requires
a new rsync) or exporting <a href="#RSYNC_OLD_ARGS">RSYNC_OLD_ARGS</a>=1 and <a href="#RSYNC_PROTECT_ARGS">RSYNC_PROTECT_ARGS</a>=0
(which works with old or new rsync versions).</p>
<h2 id="CONNECTING_TO_AN_RSYNC_DAEMON">CONNECTING TO AN RSYNC DAEMON<a href="#CONNECTING_TO_AN_RSYNC_DAEMON" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>It is also possible to use rsync without a remote shell as the transport.  In
this case you will directly connect to a remote rsync daemon, typically using
TCP port 873. (This obviously requires the daemon to be running on the remote
system, so refer to the <a href="#STARTING_AN_RSYNC_DAEMON_TO_ACCEPT_CONNECTIONS">STARTING AN RSYNC DAEMON TO ACCEPT CONNECTIONS</a>
section below for information on that.)</p>
<p>Using rsync in this way is the same as using it with a remote shell except
that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use either double-colon syntax or rsync:// URL syntax instead of the
single-colon (remote shell) syntax.</li>
<li>The first element of the &quot;path&quot; is actually a module name.</li>
<li>Additional remote source args can use an abbreviated syntax that omits the
hostname and/or the module name, as discussed in <a href="#ADVANCED_USAGE">ADVANCED USAGE</a>.</li>
<li>The remote daemon may print a &quot;message of the day&quot; when you connect.</li>
<li>If you specify only the host (with no module or path) then a list of
accessible modules on the daemon is output.</li>
<li>If you specify a remote source path but no destination, a listing of the
matching files on the remote daemon is output.</li>
<li>The <a href="#opt--rsh"><code>--rsh</code></a> (<code>-e</code>) option must be omitted to avoid changing the
connection style from using a socket connection to <a href="#USING_RSYNC-DAEMON_FEATURES_VIA_A_REMOTE-SHELL_CONNECTION">USING RSYNC-DAEMON
FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example that copies all the files in a remote module named &quot;src&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av host::src /dest
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Some modules on the remote daemon may require authentication.  If so, you will
receive a password prompt when you connect.  You can avoid the password prompt
by setting the environment variable <a href="#RSYNC_PASSWORD"><code>RSYNC_PASSWORD</code></a> to the password you
want to use or using the <a href="#opt--password-file"><code>--password-file</code></a> option.  This may be useful
when scripting rsync.</p>
<p>WARNING: On some systems environment variables are visible to all users.  On
those systems using <a href="#opt--password-file"><code>--password-file</code></a> is recommended.</p>
<p>You may establish the connection via a web proxy by setting the environment
variable <a href="#RSYNC_PROXY"><code>RSYNC_PROXY</code></a> to a hostname:port pair pointing to your web proxy.
Note that your web proxy's configuration must support proxy connections to port
873.</p>
<p>You may also establish a daemon connection using a program as a proxy by
setting the environment variable <a href="#RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG"><code>RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG</code></a> to the commands you
wish to run in place of making a direct socket connection.  The string may
contain the escape &quot;%H&quot; to represent the hostname specified in the rsync
command (so use &quot;%%&quot; if you need a single &quot;%&quot; in your string).  For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>export RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG='ssh proxyhost nc %H 873'
rsync -av targethost1::module/src/ /dest/
rsync -av rsync://targethost2/module/src/ /dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The command specified above uses ssh to run nc (netcat) on a proxyhost, which
forwards all data to port 873 (the rsync daemon) on the targethost (%H).</p>
<p>Note also that if the <a href="#RSYNC_SHELL"><code>RSYNC_SHELL</code></a> environment variable is set, that
program will be used to run the <code>RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG</code> command instead of using
the default shell of the <strong>system()</strong> call.</p>
<h2 id="USING_RSYNC-DAEMON_FEATURES_VIA_A_REMOTE-SHELL_CONNECTION">USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION<a href="#USING_RSYNC-DAEMON_FEATURES_VIA_A_REMOTE-SHELL_CONNECTION" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>It is sometimes useful to use various features of an rsync daemon (such as
named modules) without actually allowing any new socket connections into a
system (other than what is already required to allow remote-shell access).
Rsync supports connecting to a host using a remote shell and then spawning a
single-use &quot;daemon&quot; server that expects to read its config file in the home dir
of the remote user.  This can be useful if you want to encrypt a daemon-style
transfer's data, but since the daemon is started up fresh by the remote user,
you may not be able to use features such as chroot or change the uid used by
the daemon. (For another way to encrypt a daemon transfer, consider using ssh
to tunnel a local port to a remote machine and configure a normal rsync daemon
on that remote host to only allow connections from &quot;localhost&quot;.)</p>
<p>From the user's perspective, a daemon transfer via a remote-shell connection
uses nearly the same command-line syntax as a normal rsync-daemon transfer,
with the only exception being that you must explicitly set the remote shell
program on the command-line with the <a href="#opt--rsh"><code>--rsh=COMMAND</code></a> option. (Setting the
RSYNC_RSH in the environment will not turn on this functionality.) For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av --rsh=ssh host::module /dest
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you need to specify a different remote-shell user, keep in mind that the
user@ prefix in front of the host is specifying the rsync-user value (for a
module that requires user-based authentication).  This means that you must give
the '-&#8288;l user' option to ssh when specifying the remote-shell, as in this
example that uses the short version of the <a href="#opt--rsh"><code>--rsh</code></a> option:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av -e &quot;ssh -l ssh-user&quot; rsync-user@host::module /dest
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;ssh-user&quot; will be used at the ssh level; the &quot;rsync-user&quot; will be used to
log-in to the &quot;module&quot;.</p>
<p>In this setup, the daemon is started by the ssh command that is accessing the
system (which can be forced via the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file, if desired).
However, when accessing a daemon directly, it needs to be started beforehand.</p>
<h2 id="STARTING_AN_RSYNC_DAEMON_TO_ACCEPT_CONNECTIONS">STARTING AN RSYNC DAEMON TO ACCEPT CONNECTIONS<a href="#STARTING_AN_RSYNC_DAEMON_TO_ACCEPT_CONNECTIONS" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>In order to connect to an rsync daemon, the remote system needs to have a
daemon already running (or it needs to have configured something like inetd to
spawn an rsync daemon for incoming connections on a particular port).  For full
information on how to start a daemon that will handling incoming socket
connections, see the <a href="rsyncd.conf.5"><strong>rsyncd.conf</strong>(5)</a> manpage&nbsp;-&#8288;-&#8288; that is
the config file for the daemon, and it contains the full details for how to run
the daemon (including stand-alone and inetd configurations).</p>
<p>If you're using one of the remote-shell transports for the transfer, there is
no need to manually start an rsync daemon.</p>
<h2 id="EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES<a href="#EXAMPLES" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>Here are some examples of how rsync can be used.</p>
<p>To backup a home directory, which consists of large MS Word files and mail
folders, a per-user cron job can be used that runs this each day:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -aiz . bkhost:backup/joe/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To move some files from a remote host to the local host, you could run:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -aiv --remove-source-files rhost:/tmp/{file1,file2}.c ~/src/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="OPTIONS">OPTIONS<a href="#OPTIONS" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>Rsync accepts both long (double-dash + word) and short (single-dash + letter)
options.  The full list of the available options are described below.  If an
option can be specified in more than one way, the choices are comma-separated.
Some options only have a long variant, not a short.</p>
<p>If the option takes a parameter, the parameter is only listed after the long
variant, even though it must also be specified for the short.  When specifying
a parameter, you can either use the form <code>--option=param</code>, <code>--option param</code>,
<code>-o=param</code>, <code>-o param</code>, or <code>-oparam</code> (the latter choices assume that your
option has a short variant).</p>
<p>The parameter may need to be quoted in some manner for it to survive the
shell's command-line parsing.  Also keep in mind that a leading tilde (<code>~</code>) in
a pathname is substituted by your shell, so make sure that you separate the
option name from the pathname using a space if you want the local shell to
expand it.</p>
<dl>

<dt id="opt--help"><code>--help</code><a href="#opt--help" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Print a short help page describing the options available in rsync and exit.
You can also use <code>-h</code> for <code>--help</code> when it is used without any other
options (since it normally means <a href="#opt--human-readable"><code>--human-readable</code></a>).</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-V"></span><dt id="opt--version"><code>--version</code>, <code>-V</code><a href="#opt--version" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Print the rsync version plus other info and exit.  When repeated, the
information is output is a JSON format that is still fairly readable
(client side only).</p>
<p>The output includes a list of compiled-in capabilities, a list of
optimizations, the default list of checksum algorithms, the default list of
compression algorithms, the default list of daemon auth digests, a link to
the rsync web site, and a few other items.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-v"></span><dt id="opt--verbose"><code>--verbose</code>, <code>-v</code><a href="#opt--verbose" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option increases the amount of information you are given during the
transfer.  By default, rsync works silently.  A single <code>-v</code> will give you
information about what files are being transferred and a brief summary at
the end.  Two <code>-v</code> options will give you information on what files are
being skipped and slightly more information at the end.  More than two <code>-v</code>
options should only be used if you are debugging rsync.</p>
<p>The end-of-run summary tells you the number of bytes sent to the remote
rsync (which is the receiving side on a local copy), the number of bytes
received from the remote host, and the average bytes per second of the
transferred data computed over the entire length of the rsync run. The
second line shows the total size (in bytes), which is the sum of all the
file sizes that rsync considered transferring.  It also shows a &quot;speedup&quot;
value, which is a ratio of the total file size divided by the sum of the
sent and received bytes (which is really just a feel-good bigger-is-better
number).  Note that these byte values can be made more (or less)
human-readable by using the <a href="#opt--human-readable"><code>--human-readable</code></a> (or
<code>--no-human-readable</code>) options.</p>
<p>In a modern rsync, the <code>-v</code> option is equivalent to the setting of groups
of <a href="#opt--info"><code>--info</code></a> and <a href="#opt--debug"><code>--debug</code></a> options.  You can choose to use
these newer options in addition to, or in place of using <code>--verbose</code>, as
any fine-grained settings override the implied settings of <code>-v</code>.  Both
<a href="#opt--info"><code>--info</code></a> and <a href="#opt--debug"><code>--debug</code></a> have a way to ask for help that
tells you exactly what flags are set for each increase in verbosity.</p>
<p>However, do keep in mind that a daemon's &quot;<code>max verbosity</code>&quot; setting will limit
how high of a level the various individual flags can be set on the daemon
side.  For instance, if the max is 2, then any info and/or debug flag that
is set to a higher value than what would be set by <code>-vv</code> will be downgraded
to the <code>-vv</code> level in the daemon's logging.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--info"><code>--info=FLAGS</code><a href="#opt--info" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option lets you have fine-grained control over the information output
you want to see.  An individual flag name may be followed by a level
number, with 0 meaning to silence that output, 1 being the default output
level, and higher numbers increasing the output of that flag (for those
that support higher levels).  Use <code>--info=help</code> to see all the available
flag names, what they output, and what flag names are added for each
increase in the verbose level.  Some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -a --info=progress2 src/ dest/
rsync -avv --info=stats2,misc1,flist0 src/ dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that <code>--info=name</code>'s output is affected by the <a href="#opt--out-format"><code>--out-format</code></a>
and <a href="#opt--itemize-changes"><code>--itemize-changes</code></a> (<code>-i</code>) options.  See those options for more
information on what is output and when.</p>
<p>This option was added to 3.1.0, so an older rsync on the server side might
reject your attempts at fine-grained control (if one or more flags needed
to be send to the server and the server was too old to understand them).
See also the &quot;<code>max verbosity</code>&quot; caveat above when dealing with a daemon.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--debug"><code>--debug=FLAGS</code><a href="#opt--debug" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option lets you have fine-grained control over the debug output you
want to see.  An individual flag name may be followed by a level number,
with 0 meaning to silence that output, 1 being the default output level,
and higher numbers increasing the output of that flag (for those that
support higher levels).  Use <code>--debug=help</code> to see all the available flag
names, what they output, and what flag names are added for each increase in
the verbose level.  Some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -avvv --debug=none src/ dest/
rsync -avA --del --debug=del2,acl src/ dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that some debug messages will only be output when the <a href="#opt--stderr"><code>--stderr=all</code></a>
option is specified, especially those pertaining to I/O and buffer debugging.</p>
<p>Beginning in 3.2.0, this option is no longer auto-forwarded to the server
side in order to allow you to specify different debug values for each side
of the transfer, as well as to specify a new debug option that is only
present in one of the rsync versions.  If you want to duplicate the same
option on both sides, using brace expansion is an easy way to save you some
typing.  This works in zsh and bash:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -aiv {-M,}--debug=del2 src/ dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--stderr"><code>--stderr=errors|all|client</code><a href="#opt--stderr" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option controls which processes output to stderr and if info messages
are also changed to stderr.  The mode strings can be abbreviated, so feel
free to use a single letter value.  The 3 possible choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>errors</code> -&#8288; (the default) causes all the rsync processes to send an
error directly to stderr, even if the process is on the remote side of
the transfer.  Info messages are sent to the client side via the protocol
stream.  If stderr is not available (i.e. when directly connecting with a
daemon via a socket) errors fall back to being sent via the protocol
stream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>all</code> -&#8288; causes all rsync messages (info and error) to get written
directly to stderr from all (possible) processes.  This causes stderr to
become line-buffered (instead of raw) and eliminates the ability to
divide up the info and error messages by file handle.  For those doing
debugging or using several levels of verbosity, this option can help to
avoid clogging up the transfer stream (which should prevent any chance of
a deadlock bug hanging things up).  It also allows <a href="#opt--debug"><code>--debug</code></a> to
enable some extra I/O related messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>client</code> -&#8288; causes all rsync messages to be sent to the client side
via the protocol stream.  One client process outputs all messages, with
errors on stderr and info messages on stdout.  This <strong>was</strong> the default
in older rsync versions, but can cause error delays when a lot of
transfer data is ahead of the messages.  If you're pushing files to an
older rsync, you may want to use <code>--stderr=all</code> since that idiom has
been around for several releases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This option was added in rsync 3.2.3.  This version also began the
forwarding of a non-default setting to the remote side, though rsync uses
the backward-compatible options <code>--msgs2stderr</code> and <code>--no-msgs2stderr</code> to
represent the <code>all</code> and <code>client</code> settings, respectively.  A newer rsync
will continue to accept these older option names to maintain compatibility.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-q"></span><dt id="opt--quiet"><code>--quiet</code>, <code>-q</code><a href="#opt--quiet" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option decreases the amount of information you are given during the
transfer, notably suppressing information messages from the remote server.
This option is useful when invoking rsync from cron.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--no-motd"><code>--no-motd</code><a href="#opt--no-motd" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option affects the information that is output by the client at the
start of a daemon transfer.  This suppresses the message-of-the-day (MOTD)
text, but it also affects the list of modules that the daemon sends in
response to the &quot;rsync host::&quot; request (due to a limitation in the rsync
protocol), so omit this option if you want to request the list of modules
from the daemon.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-I"></span><dt id="opt--ignore-times"><code>--ignore-times</code>, <code>-I</code><a href="#opt--ignore-times" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Normally rsync will skip any files that are already the same size and have
the same modification timestamp.  This option turns off this &quot;quick check&quot;
behavior, causing all files to be updated.</p>
<p>This option can be confusing compared to <a href="#opt--ignore-existing"><code>--ignore-existing</code></a> and
<a href="#opt--ignore-non-existing"><code>--ignore-non-existing</code></a> in that that they cause rsync to transfer
fewer files, while this option causes rsync to transfer more files.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--size-only"><code>--size-only</code><a href="#opt--size-only" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This modifies rsync's &quot;quick check&quot; algorithm for finding files that need
to be transferred, changing it from the default of transferring files with
either a changed size or a changed last-modified time to just looking for
files that have changed in size.  This is useful when starting to use rsync
after using another mirroring system which may not preserve timestamps
exactly.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-_"></span><dt id="opt--modify-window"><code>--modify-window=NUM</code>, <code>-@</code><a href="#opt--modify-window" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>When comparing two timestamps, rsync treats the timestamps as being equal
if they differ by no more than the modify-window value.  The default is 0,
which matches just integer seconds.  If you specify a negative value (and
the receiver is at least version 3.1.3) then nanoseconds will also be taken
into account.  Specifying 1 is useful for copies to/from MS Windows FAT
filesystems, because FAT represents times with a 2-second resolution
(allowing times to differ from the original by up to 1 second).</p>
<p>If you want all your transfers to default to comparing nanoseconds, you can
create a <code>~/.popt</code> file and put these lines in it:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync alias -a -a@-1
rsync alias -t -t@-1
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>With that as the default, you'd need to specify <code>--modify-window=0</code> (aka
<code>-@0</code>) to override it and ignore nanoseconds, e.g. if you're copying
between ext3 and ext4, or if the receiving rsync is older than 3.1.3.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-c"></span><dt id="opt--checksum"><code>--checksum</code>, <code>-c</code><a href="#opt--checksum" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This changes the way rsync checks if the files have been changed and are in
need of a transfer.  Without this option, rsync uses a &quot;quick check&quot; that
(by default) checks if each file's size and time of last modification match
between the sender and receiver.  This option changes this to compare a
128-bit checksum for each file that has a matching size.  Generating the
checksums means that both sides will expend a lot of disk I/O reading all
the data in the files in the transfer, so this can slow things down
significantly (and this is prior to any reading that will be done to
transfer changed files)</p>
<p>The sending side generates its checksums while it is doing the file-system
scan that builds the list of the available files.  The receiver generates
its checksums when it is scanning for changed files, and will checksum any
file that has the same size as the corresponding sender's file: files with
either a changed size or a changed checksum are selected for transfer.</p>
<p>Note that rsync always verifies that each <u>transferred</u> file was correctly
reconstructed on the receiving side by checking a whole-file checksum that
is generated as the file is transferred, but that automatic
after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do with this option's
before-the-transfer &quot;Does this file need to be updated?&quot; check.</p>
<p>The checksum used is auto-negotiated between the client and the server, but
can be overridden using either the <a href="#opt--checksum-choice"><code>--checksum-choice</code></a> (<code>--cc</code>)
option or an environment variable that is discussed in that option's
section.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-a"></span><dt id="opt--archive"><code>--archive</code>, <code>-a</code><a href="#opt--archive" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This is equivalent to <code>-rlptgoD</code>.  It is a quick way of saying you want
recursion and want to preserve almost everything.  Be aware that it does
<strong>not</strong> include preserving ACLs (<code>-A</code>), xattrs (<code>-X</code>), atimes (<code>-U</code>),
crtimes (<code>-N</code>), nor the finding and preserving of hardlinks (<code>-H</code>).</p>
<p>The only exception to the above equivalence is when <a href="#opt--files-from"><code>--files-from</code></a>
is specified, in which case <a href="#opt-r"><code>-r</code></a> is not implied.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--no-OPTION"><code>--no-OPTION</code><a href="#opt--no-OPTION" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>You may turn off one or more implied options by prefixing the option name
with &quot;no-&quot;.  Not all positive options have a negated opposite, but a lot
do, including those that can be used to disable an implied option (e.g.
<code>--no-D</code>, <code>--no-perms</code>) or have different defaults in various circumstances
(e.g. <a href="#opt--no-whole-file"><code>--no-whole-file</code></a>, <code>--no-blocking-io</code>, <code>--no-dirs</code>).  Every
valid negated option accepts both the short and the long option name after
the &quot;no-&quot; prefix (e.g. <code>--no-R</code> is the same as <code>--no-relative</code>).</p>
<p>As an example, if you want to use <a href="#opt--archive"><code>--archive</code></a> (<code>-a</code>) but don't want
<a href="#opt--owner"><code>--owner</code></a> (<code>-o</code>), instead of converting <code>-a</code> into <code>-rlptgD</code>, you
can specify <code>-a --no-o</code> (aka <code>--archive --no-owner</code>).</p>
<p>The order of the options is important: if you specify <code>--no-r -a</code>, the <code>-r</code>
option would end up being turned on, the opposite of <code>-a --no-r</code>.  Note
also that the side-effects of the <a href="#opt--files-from"><code>--files-from</code></a> option are NOT
positional, as it affects the default state of several options and slightly
changes the meaning of <a href="#opt-a"><code>-a</code></a> (see the <a href="#opt--files-from"><code>--files-from</code></a> option
for more details).</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-r"></span><dt id="opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code>, <code>-r</code><a href="#opt--recursive" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to copy directories recursively.  See also
<a href="#opt--dirs"><code>--dirs</code></a> (<code>-d</code>) for an option that allows the scanning of a single
directory.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#opt--inc-recursive"><code>--inc-recursive</code></a> option for a discussion of the
incremental recursion for creating the list of files to transfer.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt--i-r"></span><dt id="opt--inc-recursive"><code>--inc-recursive</code>, <code>--i-r</code><a href="#opt--inc-recursive" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option explicitly enables on incremental recursion when scanning for
files, which is enabled by default when using the <a href="#opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code></a>
option and both sides of the transfer are running rsync 3.0.0 or newer.</p>
<p>Incremental recursion uses much less memory than non-incremental, while
also beginning the transfer more quickly (since it doesn't need to scan the
entire transfer hierarchy before it starts transferring files).  If no
recursion is enabled in the source files, this option has no effect.</p>
<p>Some options require rsync to know the full file list, so these options
disable the incremental recursion mode.  These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#opt--delete-before"><code>--delete-before</code></a> (the old default of <a href="#opt--delete"><code>--delete</code></a>)</li>
<li><a href="#opt--delete-after"><code>--delete-after</code></a></li>
<li><a href="#opt--prune-empty-dirs"><code>--prune-empty-dirs</code></a></li>
<li><a href="#opt--delay-updates"><code>--delay-updates</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to make <a href="#opt--delete"><code>--delete</code></a> compatible with incremental recursion,
rsync 3.0.0 made <a href="#opt--delete-during"><code>--delete-during</code></a> the default delete mode (which
was first added in 2.6.4).</p>
<p>One side-effect of incremental recursion is that any missing
sub-directories inside a recursively-scanned directory are (by default)
created prior to recursing into the sub-dirs.  This earlier creation point
(compared to a non-incremental recursion) allows rsync to then set the
modify time of the finished directory right away (without having to delay
that until a bunch of recursive copying has finished).  However, these
early directories don't yet have their completed mode, mtime, or ownership
set&nbsp;-&#8288;-&#8288; they have more restrictive rights until the subdirectory's copying
actually begins.  This early-creation idiom can be avoided by using the
<a href="#opt--omit-dir-times"><code>--omit-dir-times</code></a> option.</p>
<p>Incremental recursion can be disabled using the
<a href="#opt--no-inc-recursive"><code>--no-inc-recursive</code></a> (<code>--no-i-r</code>) option.</p>

<p>Disables the new incremental recursion algorithm of the
<a href="#opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code></a> option.  This makes rsync scan the full file list
before it begins to transfer files.  See <a href="#opt--inc-recursive"><code>--inc-recursive</code></a> for more
info.</p>

<span id="opt-R"></span><dt id="opt--relative"><code>--relative</code>, <code>-R</code><a href="#opt--relative" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Use relative paths.  This means that the full path names specified on the
command line are sent to the server rather than just the last parts of the
filenames.  This is particularly useful when you want to send several
different directories at the same time.  For example, if you used this
command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av /foo/bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>would create a file named baz.c in /tmp/ on the remote machine.  If instead
you used</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -avR /foo/bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>then a file named /tmp/foo/bar/baz.c would be created on the remote
machine, preserving its full path.  These extra path elements are called
&quot;implied directories&quot; (i.e. the &quot;foo&quot; and the &quot;foo/bar&quot; directories in the
above example).</p>
<p>Beginning with rsync 3.0.0, rsync always sends these implied directories as
real directories in the file list, even if a path element is really a
symlink on the sending side.  This prevents some really unexpected behaviors
when copying the full path of a file that you didn't realize had a symlink
in its path.  If you want to duplicate a server-side symlink, include both
the symlink via its path, and referent directory via its real path.  If
you're dealing with an older rsync on the sending side, you may need to use
the <a href="#opt--no-implied-dirs"><code>--no-implied-dirs</code></a> option.</p>
<p>It is also possible to limit the amount of path information that is sent as
implied directories for each path you specify.  With a modern rsync on the
sending side (beginning with 2.6.7), you can insert a dot and a slash into
the source path, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -avR /foo/./bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>That would create /tmp/bar/baz.c on the remote machine. (Note that the dot
must be followed by a slash, so &quot;/foo/.&quot; would not be abbreviated.) For
older rsync versions, you would need to use a chdir to limit the source
path.  For example, when pushing files:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>(cd /foo; rsync -avR bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note that the parens put the two commands into a sub-shell, so that the
&quot;cd&quot; command doesn't remain in effect for future commands.) If you're
pulling files from an older rsync, use this idiom (but only for a
non-daemon transfer):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -avR --rsync-path=&quot;cd /foo; rsync&quot; \
     remote:bar/baz.c /tmp/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--no-implied-dirs"><code>--no-implied-dirs</code><a href="#opt--no-implied-dirs" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option affects the default behavior of the <a href="#opt--relative"><code>--relative</code></a> option.  When
it is specified, the attributes of the implied directories from the source
names are not included in the transfer.  This means that the corresponding
path elements on the destination system are left unchanged if they exist,
and any missing implied directories are created with default attributes.
This even allows these implied path elements to have big differences, such
as being a symlink to a directory on the receiving side.</p>
<p>For instance, if a command-line arg or a files-from entry told rsync to
transfer the file &quot;path/foo/file&quot;, the directories &quot;path&quot; and &quot;path/foo&quot;
are implied when <a href="#opt--relative"><code>--relative</code></a> is used.  If &quot;path/foo&quot; is a symlink to &quot;bar&quot;
on the destination system, the receiving rsync would ordinarily delete
&quot;path/foo&quot;, recreate it as a directory, and receive the file into the new
directory.  With <code>--no-implied-dirs</code>, the receiving rsync updates
&quot;path/foo/file&quot; using the existing path elements, which means that the file
ends up being created in &quot;path/bar&quot;.  Another way to accomplish this link
preservation is to use the <a href="#opt--keep-dirlinks"><code>--keep-dirlinks</code></a> option (which will also affect
symlinks to directories in the rest of the transfer).</p>
<p>When pulling files from an rsync older than 3.0.0, you may need to use this
option if the sending side has a symlink in the path you request and you
wish the implied directories to be transferred as normal directories.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-b"></span><dt id="opt--backup"><code>--backup</code>, <code>-b</code><a href="#opt--backup" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>With this option, preexisting destination files are renamed as each file is
transferred or deleted.  You can control where the backup file goes and
what (if any) suffix gets appended using the <a href="#opt--backup-dir"><code>--backup-dir</code></a> and
<a href="#opt--suffix"><code>--suffix</code></a> options.</p>
<p>If you don't specify <a href="#opt--backup-dir"><code>--backup-dir</code></a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>the <a href="#opt--omit-dir-times"><code>--omit-dir-times</code></a> option will be forced on</li>
<li>the use of <a href="#opt--delete"><code>--delete</code></a> (without <a href="#opt--delete-excluded"><code>--delete-excluded</code></a>),
causes rsync to add a &quot;protect&quot; <a href="#FILTER_RULES">filter-rule</a> for the
backup suffix to the end of all your existing filters that looks like
this: <code>-f &quot;P *~&quot;</code>.  This rule prevents previously backed-up files from
being deleted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that if you are supplying your own filter rules, you may need to
manually insert your own exclude/protect rule somewhere higher up in the
list so that it has a high enough priority to be effective (e.g. if your
rules specify a trailing inclusion/exclusion of <code>*</code>, the auto-added rule
would never be reached).</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--backup-dir"><code>--backup-dir=DIR</code><a href="#opt--backup-dir" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This implies the <a href="#opt--backup"><code>--backup</code></a> option, and tells rsync to store all
backups in the specified directory on the receiving side.  This can be used
for incremental backups.  You can additionally specify a backup suffix
using the <a href="#opt--suffix"><code>--suffix</code></a> option (otherwise the files backed up in the
specified directory will keep their original filenames).</p>
<p>Note that if you specify a relative path, the backup directory will be
relative to the destination directory, so you probably want to specify
either an absolute path or a path that starts with &quot;../&quot;.  If an rsync
daemon is the receiver, the backup dir cannot go outside the module's path
hierarchy, so take extra care not to delete it or copy into it.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--suffix"><code>--suffix=SUFFIX</code><a href="#opt--suffix" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option allows you to override the default backup suffix used with the
<a href="#opt--backup"><code>--backup</code></a> (<code>-b</code>) option.  The default suffix is a <code>~</code> if no
<a href="#opt--backup-dir"><code>--backup-dir</code></a> was specified, otherwise it is an empty string.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-u"></span><dt id="opt--update"><code>--update</code>, <code>-u</code><a href="#opt--update" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This forces rsync to skip any files which exist on the destination and have
a modified time that is newer than the source file. (If an existing
destination file has a modification time equal to the source file's, it
will be updated if the sizes are different.)</p>
<p>Note that this does not affect the copying of dirs, symlinks, or other
special files.  Also, a difference of file format between the sender and
receiver is always considered to be important enough for an update, no
matter what date is on the objects.  In other words, if the source has a
directory where the destination has a file, the transfer would occur
regardless of the timestamps.</p>
<p>This option is a <a href="#TRANSFER_RULES">TRANSFER RULE</a>, so don't expect any
exclude side effects.</p>
<p>A caution for those that choose to combine <a href="#opt--inplace"><code>--inplace</code></a> with
<code>--update</code>: an interrupted transfer will leave behind a partial file on the
receiving side that has a very recent modified time, so re-running the
transfer will probably <strong>not</strong> continue the interrupted file.  As such, it
is usually best to avoid combining this with<a href="#opt--inplace"> <code>--inplace</code></a> unless you
have implemented manual steps to handle any interrupted in-progress files.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--inplace"><code>--inplace</code><a href="#opt--inplace" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option changes how rsync transfers a file when its data needs to be
updated: instead of the default method of creating a new copy of the file
and moving it into place when it is complete, rsync instead writes the
updated data directly to the destination file.</p>
<p>This has several effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard links are not broken.  This means the new data will be visible
through other hard links to the destination file.  Moreover, attempts to
copy differing source files onto a multiply-linked destination file will
result in a &quot;tug of war&quot; with the destination data changing back and
forth.</li>
<li>In-use binaries cannot be updated (either the OS will prevent this from
happening, or binaries that attempt to swap-in their data will misbehave
or crash).</li>
<li>The file's data will be in an inconsistent state during the transfer and
will be left that way if the transfer is interrupted or if an update
fails.</li>
<li>A file that rsync cannot write to cannot be updated.  While a super user
can update any file, a normal user needs to be granted write permission
for the open of the file for writing to be successful.</li>
<li>The efficiency of rsync's delta-transfer algorithm may be reduced if some
data in the destination file is overwritten before it can be copied to a
position later in the file.  This does not apply if you use <a href="#opt--backup"><code>--backup</code></a>,
since rsync is smart enough to use the backup file as the basis file for
the transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p>WARNING: you should not use this option to update files that are being
accessed by others, so be careful when choosing to use this for a copy.</p>
<p>This option is useful for transferring large files with block-based changes
or appended data, and also on systems that are disk bound, not network
bound.  It can also help keep a copy-on-write filesystem snapshot from
diverging the entire contents of a file that only has minor changes.</p>
<p>The option implies <a href="#opt--partial"><code>--partial</code></a> (since an interrupted transfer does
not delete the file), but conflicts with <a href="#opt--partial-dir"><code>--partial-dir</code></a> and
<a href="#opt--delay-updates"><code>--delay-updates</code></a>.  Prior to rsync 2.6.4 <code>--inplace</code> was also
incompatible with <a href="#opt--compare-dest"><code>--compare-dest</code></a> and <a href="#opt--link-dest"><code>--link-dest</code></a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--append"><code>--append</code><a href="#opt--append" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This special copy mode only works to efficiently update files that are
known to be growing larger where any existing content on the receiving side
is also known to be the same as the content on the sender.  The use of
<code>--append</code> <strong>can be dangerous</strong> if you aren't 100% sure that all the files
in the transfer are shared, growing files.  You should thus use filter
rules to ensure that you weed out any files that do not fit this criteria.</p>
<p>Rsync updates these growing file in-place without verifying any of the
existing content in the file (it only verifies the content that it is
appending).  Rsync skips any files that exist on the receiving side that
are not shorter than the associated file on the sending side (which means
that new files are transferred).  It also skips any files whose size on the
sending side gets shorter during the send negotiations (rsync warns about a
&quot;diminished&quot; file when this happens).</p>
<p>This does not interfere with the updating of a file's non-content
attributes (e.g.  permissions, ownership, etc.) when the file does not need
to be transferred, nor does it affect the updating of any directories or
non-regular files.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--append-verify"><code>--append-verify</code><a href="#opt--append-verify" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This special copy mode works like <a href="#opt--append"><code>--append</code></a> except that all the
data in the file is included in the checksum verification (making it less
efficient but also potentially safer).  This option <strong>can be dangerous</strong> if
you aren't 100% sure that all the files in the transfer are shared, growing
files.  See the <a href="#opt--append"><code>--append</code></a> option for more details.</p>
<p>Note: prior to rsync 3.0.0, the <a href="#opt--append"><code>--append</code></a> option worked like
<code>--append-verify</code>, so if you are interacting with an older rsync (or the
transfer is using a protocol prior to 30), specifying either append option
will initiate an <code>--append-verify</code> transfer.</p>

<span id="opt-d"></span><dt id="opt--dirs"><code>--dirs</code>, <code>-d</code><a href="#opt--dirs" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Tell the sending side to include any directories that are encountered.
Unlike <a href="#opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code></a>, a directory's contents are not copied unless
the directory name specified is &quot;.&quot; or ends with a trailing slash (e.g.
&quot;.&quot;, &quot;dir/.&quot;, &quot;dir/&quot;, etc.).  Without this option or the
<a href="#opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code></a> option, rsync will skip all directories it encounters
(and output a message to that effect for each one).  If you specify both
<code>--dirs</code> and <a href="#opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code></a>, <code>--recursive</code> takes precedence.</p>
<p>The <code>--dirs</code> option is implied by the <a href="#opt--files-from"><code>--files-from</code></a> option or the
<a href="#opt--list-only"><code>--list-only</code></a> option (including an implied <a href="#opt--list-only"><code>--list-only</code></a>
usage) if <a href="#opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code></a> wasn't specified (so that directories are
seen in the listing).  Specify <code>--no-dirs</code> (or <code>--no-d</code>) if you want to
turn this off.</p>
<p>There is also a backward-compatibility helper option, <code>--old-dirs</code>
(<code>--old-d</code>) that tells rsync to use a hack of <code>-r --exclude='/*/*'</code> to get
an older rsync to list a single directory without recursing.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--mkpath"><code>--mkpath</code><a href="#opt--mkpath" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Create all missing path components of the destination path.</p>
<p>By default, rsync allows only the final component of the destination path
to not exist, which is an attempt to help you to validate your destination
path.  With this option, rsync creates all the missing destination-path
components, just as if <code>mkdir -p $DEST_PATH</code> had been run on the receiving
side.</p>
<p>When specifying a destination path, including a trailing slash ensures that
the whole path is treated as directory names to be created, even when the
file list has a single item. See the <a href="#COPYING_TO_A_DIFFERENT_NAME">COPYING TO A DIFFERENT NAME</a>
section for full details on how rsync decides if a final destination-path
component should be created as a directory or not.</p>
<p>If you would like the newly-created destination dirs to match the dirs on
the sending side, you should be using <a href="#opt--relative"><code>--relative</code></a> (<code>-R</code>) instead
of <code>--mkpath</code>.  For instance, the following two commands result in the same
destination tree, but only the second command ensures that the
&quot;some/extra/path&quot; components match the dirs on the sending side:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -ai --mkpath host:some/extra/path/*.c some/extra/path/
rsync -aiR host:some/extra/path/*.c ./
</code></pre>

<p>Add symlinks to the transferred files instead of noisily ignoring them with
a &quot;non-regular file&quot; warning for each symlink encountered.  You can
alternately silence the warning by specifying <a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=nonreg0</code></a>.</p>
<p>The default handling of symlinks is to recreate each symlink's unchanged
value on the receiving side.</p>

<span id="opt-L"></span><dt id="opt--copy-links"><code>--copy-links</code>, <code>-L</code><a href="#opt--copy-links" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>The sender transforms each symlink encountered in the transfer into the
referent item, following the symlink chain to the file or directory that it
references.  If a symlink chain is broken, an error is output and the file
is dropped from the transfer.</p>
<p>This option supersedes any other options that affect symlinks in the
transfer, since there are no symlinks left in the transfer.</p>
<p>This option does not change the handling of existing symlinks on the
receiving side, unlike versions of rsync prior to 2.6.3 which had the
side-effect of telling the receiving side to also follow symlinks.  A
modern rsync won't forward this option to a remote receiver (since only the
sender needs to know about it), so this caveat should only affect someone
using an rsync client older than 2.6.7 (which is when <code>-L</code> stopped being
forwarded to the receiver).</p>
<p>See the <a href="#opt--keep-dirlinks"><code>--keep-dirlinks</code></a> (<code>-K</code>) if you need a symlink to a
directory to be treated as a real directory on the receiving side.</p>

</dd>

<dt id="opt--copy-unsafe-links"><code>--copy-unsafe-links</code><a href="#opt--copy-unsafe-links" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to copy the referent of symbolic links that point outside
the copied tree.  Absolute symlinks are also treated like ordinary files,
and so are any symlinks in the source path itself when <a href="#opt--relative"><code>--relative</code></a>
is used.</p>
<p>Note that the cut-off point is the top of the transfer, which is the part
of the path that rsync isn't mentioning in the verbose output.  If you copy
&quot;/src/subdir&quot; to &quot;/dest/&quot; then the &quot;subdir&quot; directory is a name inside the
transfer tree, not the top of the transfer (which is /src) so it is legal
for created relative symlinks to refer to other names inside the /src and
/dest directories.  If you instead copy &quot;/src/subdir/&quot; (with a trailing
slash) to &quot;/dest/subdir&quot; that would not allow symlinks to any files outside
of &quot;subdir&quot;.</p>
<p>Note that safe symlinks are only copied if <a href="#opt--links"><code>--links</code></a> was also
specified or implied. The <code>--copy-unsafe-links</code> option has no extra effect
when combined with <a href="#opt--copy-links"><code>--copy-links</code></a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#SYMBOLIC_LINKS">SYMBOLIC LINKS</a> section for multi-option info.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--safe-links"><code>--safe-links</code><a href="#opt--safe-links" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells the receiving rsync to ignore any symbolic links in the transfer
which point outside the copied tree.  All absolute symlinks are also
ignored.</p>
<p>Since this ignoring is happening on the receiving side, it will still be
effective even when the sending side has munged symlinks (when it is using
<a href="#opt--munge-links"><code>--munge-links</code></a>). It also affects deletions, since the file being
present in the transfer prevents any matching file on the receiver from
being deleted when the symlink is deemed to be unsafe and is skipped.</p>
<p>This option must be combined with <a href="#opt--links"><code>--links</code></a> (or
<a href="#opt--archive"><code>--archive</code></a>) to have any symlinks in the transfer to conditionally
ignore. Its effect is superseded by <a href="#opt--copy-unsafe-links"><code>--copy-unsafe-links</code></a>.</p>
<p>Using this option in conjunction with <a href="#opt--relative"><code>--relative</code></a> may give
unexpected results.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#SYMBOLIC_LINKS">SYMBOLIC LINKS</a> section for multi-option info.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--munge-links"><code>--munge-links</code><a href="#opt--munge-links" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option affects just one side of the transfer and tells rsync to munge
symlink values when it is receiving files or unmunge symlink values when it
is sending files.  The munged values make the symlinks unusable on disk but
allows the original contents of the symlinks to be recovered.</p>
<p>The server-side rsync often enables this option without the client's
knowledge, such as in an rsync daemon's configuration file or by an option
given to the rrsync (restricted rsync) script.  When specified on the
client side, specify the option normally if it is the client side that
has/needs the munged symlinks, or use <code>-M--munge-links</code> to give the option
to the server when it has/needs the munged symlinks.  Note that on a local
transfer, the client is the sender, so specifying the option directly
unmunges symlinks while specifying it as a remote option munges symlinks.</p>
<p>This option has no effect when sent to a daemon via <a href="#opt--remote-option"><code>--remote-option</code></a>
because the daemon configures whether it wants munged symlinks via its
&quot;<code>munge symlinks</code>&quot; parameter.</p>
<p>The symlink value is munged/unmunged once it is in the transfer, so any
option that transforms symlinks into non-symlinks occurs prior to the
munging/unmunging <strong>except</strong> for <a href="#opt--safe-links"><code>--safe-links</code></a>, which is a choice
that the receiver makes, so it bases its decision on the munged/unmunged
value.  This does mean that if a receiver has munging enabled, that using
<a href="#opt--safe-links"><code>--safe-links</code></a> will cause all symlinks to be ignored (since they
are all absolute).</p>
<p>The method that rsync uses to munge the symlinks is to prefix each one's
value with the string &quot;/rsyncd-munged/&quot;.  This prevents the links from
being used as long as the directory does not exist.  When this option is
enabled, rsync will refuse to run if that path is a directory or a symlink
to a directory (though it only checks at startup).  See also the
&quot;munge-symlinks&quot; python script in the support directory of the source code
for a way to munge/unmunge one or more symlinks in-place.</p>

<span id="opt-k"></span><dt id="opt--copy-dirlinks"><code>--copy-dirlinks</code>, <code>-k</code><a href="#opt--copy-dirlinks" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option causes the sending side to treat a symlink to a directory as
though it were a real directory.  This is useful if you don't want symlinks
to non-directories to be affected, as they would be using
<a href="#opt--copy-links"><code>--copy-links</code></a>.</p>
<p>Without this option, if the sending side has replaced a directory with a
symlink to a directory, the receiving side will delete anything that is in
the way of the new symlink, including a directory hierarchy (as long as
<a href="#opt--force"><code>--force</code></a> or <a href="#opt--delete"><code>--delete</code></a> is in effect).</p>
<p>See also <a href="#opt--keep-dirlinks"><code>--keep-dirlinks</code></a> for an analogous option for the
receiving side.</p>
<p><code>--copy-dirlinks</code> applies to all symlinks to directories in the source.  If
you want to follow only a few specified symlinks, a trick you can use is to
pass them as additional source args with a trailing slash, using
<a href="#opt--relative"><code>--relative</code></a> to make the paths match up right.  For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -r --relative src/./ src/./follow-me/ dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This works because rsync calls <strong>lstat</strong>(2) on the source arg as given, and
the trailing slash makes <strong>lstat</strong>(2) follow the symlink, giving rise to a
directory in the file-list which overrides the symlink found during the
scan of &quot;src/./&quot;.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#SYMBOLIC_LINKS">SYMBOLIC LINKS</a> section for multi-option info.</p>

<span id="opt-K"></span><dt id="opt--keep-dirlinks"><code>--keep-dirlinks</code>, <code>-K</code><a href="#opt--keep-dirlinks" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option causes the receiving side to treat a symlink to a directory as
though it were a real directory, but only if it matches a real directory
from the sender.  Without this option, the receiver's symlink would be
deleted and replaced with a real directory.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you transfer a directory &quot;foo&quot; that contains a file
&quot;file&quot;, but &quot;foo&quot; is a symlink to directory &quot;bar&quot; on the receiver.  Without
<code>--keep-dirlinks</code>, the receiver deletes symlink &quot;foo&quot;, recreates it as a
directory, and receives the file into the new directory.  With
<code>--keep-dirlinks</code>, the receiver keeps the symlink and &quot;file&quot; ends up in
&quot;bar&quot;.</p>
<p>One note of caution: if you use <code>--keep-dirlinks</code>, you must trust all the
symlinks in the copy or enable the <a href="#opt--munge-links"><code>--munge-links</code></a> option on the
receiving side!  If it is possible for an untrusted user to create their
own symlink to any real directory, the user could then (on a subsequent
copy) replace the symlink with a real directory and affect the content of
whatever directory the symlink references.  For backup copies, you are
better off using something like a bind mount instead of a symlink to modify
your receiving hierarchy.</p>

side.</p>

<span id="opt-H"></span><dt id="opt--hard-links"><code>--hard-links</code>, <code>-H</code><a href="#opt--hard-links" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to look for hard-linked files in the source and link
together the corresponding files on the destination.  Without this option,
hard-linked files in the source are treated as though they were separate
files.</p>
<p>This option does NOT necessarily ensure that the pattern of hard links on
the destination exactly matches that on the source.  Cases in which the
destination may end up with extra hard links include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the destination contains extraneous hard-links (more linking than what
is present in the source file list), the copying algorithm will not break
them explicitly.  However, if one or more of the paths have content
differences, the normal file-update process will break those extra links
(unless you are using the <a href="#opt--inplace"><code>--inplace</code></a> option).</li>
<li>If you specify a <a href="#opt--link-dest"><code>--link-dest</code></a> directory that contains hard
links, the linking of the destination files against the
<a href="#opt--link-dest"><code>--link-dest</code></a> files can cause some paths in the destination to
become linked together due to the <a href="#opt--link-dest"><code>--link-dest</code></a> associations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that rsync can only detect hard links between files that are inside
the transfer set.  If rsync updates a file that has extra hard-link
connections to files outside the transfer, that linkage will be broken.  If
you are tempted to use the <a href="#opt--inplace"><code>--inplace</code></a> option to avoid this breakage, be
very careful that you know how your files are being updated so that you are
certain that no unintended changes happen due to lingering hard links (and
see the <a href="#opt--inplace"><code>--inplace</code></a> option for more caveats).</p>
<p>If incremental recursion is active (see <a href="#opt--inc-recursive"><code>--inc-recursive</code></a>), rsync
may transfer a missing hard-linked file before it finds that another link
for that contents exists elsewhere in the hierarchy.  This does not affect
the accuracy of the transfer (i.e. which files are hard-linked together),
just its efficiency (i.e. copying the data for a new, early copy of a
hard-linked file that could have been found later in the transfer in
another member of the hard-linked set of files).  One way to avoid this
inefficiency is to disable incremental recursion using the
<a href="#opt--no-inc-recursive"><code>--no-inc-recursive</code></a> option.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-p"></span><dt id="opt--perms"><code>--perms</code>, <code>-p</code><a href="#opt--perms" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option causes the receiving rsync to set the destination permissions
to be the same as the source permissions. (See also the <a href="#opt--chmod"><code>--chmod</code></a>
option for a way to modify what rsync considers to be the source
permissions.)</p>
<p>When this option is <u>off</u>, permissions are set as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing files (including updated files) retain their existing
permissions, though the <a href="#opt--executability"><code>--executability</code></a> option might change
just the execute permission for the file.</li>
<li>New files get their &quot;normal&quot; permission bits set to the source file's
permissions masked with the receiving directory's default permissions
(either the receiving process's umask, or the permissions specified via
the destination directory's default ACL), and their special permission
bits disabled except in the case where a new directory inherits a setgid
bit from its parent directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, when <code>--perms</code> and <a href="#opt--executability"><code>--executability</code></a> are both disabled, rsync's
behavior is the same as that of other file-copy utilities, such as <strong>cp</strong>(1)
and <strong>tar</strong>(1).</p>
<p>In summary: to give destination files (both old and new) the source
permissions, use <code>--perms</code>.  To give new files the destination-default
permissions (while leaving existing files unchanged), make sure that the
<code>--perms</code> option is off and use <a href="#opt--chmod"><code>--chmod=ugo=rwX</code></a> (which ensures
that all non-masked bits get enabled).  If you'd care to make this latter
behavior easier to type, you could define a popt alias for it, such as
putting this line in the file <code>~/.popt</code> (the following defines the <code>-Z</code>
option, and includes <code>--no-g</code> to use the default group of the destination
dir):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code> rsync alias -Z --no-p --no-g --chmod=ugo=rwX
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You could then use this new option in a command such as this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code> rsync -avZ src/ dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>(Caveat: make sure that <code>-a</code> does not follow <code>-Z</code>, or it will re-enable the
two <code>--no-*</code> options mentioned above.)</p>
<p>The preservation of the destination's setgid bit on newly-created
directories when <code>--perms</code> is off was added in rsync 2.6.7.  Older rsync
versions erroneously preserved the three special permission bits for
newly-created files when <code>--perms</code> was off, while overriding the
destination's setgid bit setting on a newly-created directory.  Default ACL
observance was added to the ACL patch for rsync 2.6.7, so older (or
non-ACL-enabled) rsyncs use the umask even if default ACLs are present.
(Keep in mind that it is the version of the receiving rsync that affects
these behaviors.)</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-E"></span><dt id="opt--executability"><code>--executability</code>, <code>-E</code><a href="#opt--executability" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option causes rsync to preserve the executability (or
non-executability) of regular files when <a href="#opt--perms"><code>--perms</code></a> is not enabled.
A regular file is considered to be executable if at least one 'x' is turned
on in its permissions.  When an existing destination file's executability
differs from that of the corresponding source file, rsync modifies the
destination file's permissions as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To make a file non-executable, rsync turns off all its 'x' permissions.</li>
<li>To make a file executable, rsync turns on each 'x' permission that has a
corresponding 'r' permission enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>If <a href="#opt--perms"><code>--perms</code></a> is enabled, this option is ignored.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-A"></span><dt id="opt--acls"><code>--acls</code>, <code>-A</code><a href="#opt--acls" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option causes rsync to update the destination ACLs to be the same as
the source ACLs.  The option also implies <a href="#opt--perms"><code>--perms</code></a>.</p>
<p>The source and destination systems must have compatible ACL entries for
this option to work properly.  See the <a href="#opt--fake-super"><code>--fake-super</code></a> option for a
way to backup and restore ACLs that are not compatible.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-X"></span><dt id="opt--xattrs"><code>--xattrs</code>, <code>-X</code><a href="#opt--xattrs" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option causes rsync to update the destination extended attributes to
be the same as the source ones.</p>
<p>For systems that support extended-attribute namespaces, a copy being done
by a super-user copies all namespaces except system.*.  A normal user only
copies the user.* namespace.  To be able to backup and restore non-user
namespaces as a normal user, see the <a href="#opt--fake-super"><code>--fake-super</code></a> option.</p>
<p>The above name filtering can be overridden by using one or more filter
options with the <strong>x</strong> modifier.  When you specify an xattr-affecting
filter rule, rsync requires that you do your own system/user filtering, as
well as any additional filtering for what xattr names are copied and what
names are allowed to be deleted.  For example, to skip the system
namespace, you could specify:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>--filter='-x system.*'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To skip all namespaces except the user namespace, you could specify a
negated-user match:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>--filter='-x! user.*'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To prevent any attributes from being deleted, you could specify a
receiver-only rule that excludes all names:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>--filter='-xr *'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the <code>-X</code> option does not copy rsync's special xattr values (e.g.
those used by <a href="#opt--fake-super"><code>--fake-super</code></a>) unless you repeat the option (e.g. <code>-XX</code>).
This &quot;copy all xattrs&quot; mode cannot be used with <a href="#opt--fake-super"><code>--fake-super</code></a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--chmod"><code>--chmod=CHMOD</code><a href="#opt--chmod" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option tells rsync to apply one or more comma-separated &quot;chmod&quot; modes
to the permission of the files in the transfer.  The resulting value is
treated as though it were the permissions that the sending side supplied
for the file, which means that this option can seem to have no effect on
existing files if <a href="#opt--perms"><code>--perms</code></a> is not enabled.</p>
<p>In addition to the normal parsing rules specified in the <strong>chmod</strong>(1)
manpage, you can specify an item that should only apply to a directory by
prefixing it with a 'D', or specify an item that should only apply to a
file by prefixing it with a 'F'.  For example, the following will ensure
that all directories get marked set-gid, that no files are other-writable,
that both are user-writable and group-writable, and that both have
consistent executability across all bits:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>--chmod=Dg+s,ug+w,Fo-w,+X
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Using octal mode numbers is also allowed:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>--chmod=D2775,F664
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also legal to specify multiple <code>--chmod</code> options, as each additional
option is just appended to the list of changes to make.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#opt--perms"><code>--perms</code></a> and <a href="#opt--executability"><code>--executability</code></a> options for how the
resulting permission value can be applied to the files in the transfer.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-o"></span><dt id="opt--owner"><code>--owner</code>, <code>-o</code><a href="#opt--owner" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option causes rsync to set the owner of the destination file to be the
same as the source file, but only if the receiving rsync is being run as
the super-user (see also the <a href="#opt--super"><code>--super</code></a> and <a href="#opt--fake-super"><code>--fake-super</code></a>
options).  Without this option, the owner of new and/or transferred files
are set to the invoking user on the receiving side.</p>
<p>The preservation of ownership will associate matching names by default, but
may fall back to using the ID number in some circumstances (see also the
<a href="#opt--numeric-ids"><code>--numeric-ids</code></a> option for a full discussion).</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-g"></span><dt id="opt--group"><code>--group</code>, <code>-g</code><a href="#opt--group" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option causes rsync to set the group of the destination file to be the
same as the source file.  If the receiving program is not running as the
super-user (or if <code>--no-super</code> was specified), only groups that the
invoking user on the receiving side is a member of will be preserved.
Without this option, the group is set to the default group of the invoking
user on the receiving side.</p>
<p>The preservation of group information will associate matching names by
default, but may fall back to using the ID number in some circumstances
(see also the <a href="#opt--numeric-ids"><code>--numeric-ids</code></a> option for a full discussion).</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--devices"><code>--devices</code><a href="#opt--devices" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option causes rsync to transfer character and block device files to
the remote system to recreate these devices.  If the receiving rsync is not
being run as the super-user, rsync silently skips creating the device files
(see also the <a href="#opt--super"><code>--super</code></a> and <a href="#opt--fake-super"><code>--fake-super</code></a> options).</p>
<p>By default, rsync generates a &quot;non-regular file&quot; warning for each device
file encountered when this option is not set.  You can silence the warning
by specifying <a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=nonreg0</code></a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--specials"><code>--specials</code><a href="#opt--specials" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option causes rsync to transfer special files, such as named sockets
and fifos.  If the receiving rsync is not being run as the super-user,
rsync silently skips creating the special files (see also the
<a href="#opt--super"><code>--super</code></a> and <a href="#opt--fake-super"><code>--fake-super</code></a> options).</p>
<p>By default, rsync generates a &quot;non-regular file&quot; warning for each special
file encountered when this option is not set.  You can silence the warning
by specifying <a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=nonreg0</code></a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt-D"><code>-D</code><a href="#opt-D" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>The <code>-D</code> option is equivalent to &quot;<a href="#opt--devices"><code>--devices</code></a>
<a href="#opt--specials"><code>--specials</code></a>&quot;.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--copy-devices"><code>--copy-devices</code><a href="#opt--copy-devices" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to treat a device on the sending side as a regular file,
allowing it to be copied to a normal destination file (or another device
if <code>--write-devices</code> was also specified).</p>
<p>This option is refused by default by an rsync daemon.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--write-devices"><code>--write-devices</code><a href="#opt--write-devices" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to treat a device on the receiving side as a regular file,
allowing the writing of file data into a device.</p>
<p>This option implies the <a href="#opt--inplace"><code>--inplace</code></a> option.</p>
<p>Be careful using this, as you should know what devices are present on the
receiving side of the transfer, especially when running rsync as root.</p>
<p>This option is refused by default by an rsync daemon.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-t"></span><dt id="opt--times"><code>--times</code>, <code>-t</code><a href="#opt--times" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to transfer modification times along with the files and
update them on the remote system.  Note that if this option is not used,
the optimization that excludes files that have not been modified cannot be
effective; in other words, a missing <code>-t</code> (or <a href="#opt-a"><code>-a</code></a>) will cause the
next transfer to behave as if it used <a href="#opt--ignore-times"><code>--ignore-times</code></a> (<code>-I</code>),
causing all files to be updated (though rsync's delta-transfer algorithm
will make the update fairly efficient if the files haven't actually
changed, you're much better off using <code>-t</code>).</p>
<p>A modern rsync that is using transfer protocol 30 or 31 conveys a modify
time using up to 8-bytes. If rsync is forced to speak an older protocol
(perhaps due to the remote rsync being older than 3.0.0) a modify time is
conveyed using 4-bytes. Prior to 3.2.7, these shorter values could convey
a date range of 13-Dec-1901 to 19-Jan-2038.  Beginning with 3.2.7, these
4-byte values now convey a date range of 1-Jan-1970 to 7-Feb-2106.  If you
have files dated older than 1970, make sure your rsync executables are
upgraded so that the full range of dates can be conveyed.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-U"></span><dt id="opt--atimes"><code>--atimes</code>, <code>-U</code><a href="#opt--atimes" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to set the access (use) times of the destination files to
the same value as the source files.</p>
<p>If repeated, it also sets the <a href="#opt--open-noatime"><code>--open-noatime</code></a> option, which can help you
to make the sending and receiving systems have the same access times on the
transferred files without needing to run rsync an extra time after a file
is transferred.</p>
<p>Note that some older rsync versions (prior to 3.2.0) may have been built
with a pre-release <code>--atimes</code> patch that does not imply
<a href="#opt--open-noatime"><code>--open-noatime</code></a> when this option is repeated.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--open-noatime"><code>--open-noatime</code><a href="#opt--open-noatime" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to open files with the O_NOATIME flag (on systems that
support it) to avoid changing the access time of the files that are being
transferred.  If your OS does not support the O_NOATIME flag then rsync
will silently ignore this option.  Note also that some filesystems are
mounted to avoid updating the atime on read access even without the
O_NOATIME flag being set.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-N_"></span><dt id="opt--crtimes"><code>--crtimes</code>, <code>-N,</code><a href="#opt--crtimes" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to set the create times (newness) of the destination
files to the same value as the source files. Your OS &amp; filesystem must
support the setting of arbitrary creation (birth) times for this option
to be supported.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-O"></span><dt id="opt--omit-dir-times"><code>--omit-dir-times</code>, <code>-O</code><a href="#opt--omit-dir-times" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to omit directories when it is preserving modification,
access, and create times.  If NFS is sharing the directories on the receiving
side, it is a good idea to use <code>-O</code>.  This option is inferred if you use
<a href="#opt--backup"><code>--backup</code></a> without <a href="#opt--backup-dir"><code>--backup-dir</code></a>.</p>
<p>This option also has the side-effect of avoiding early creation of missing
sub-directories when incremental recursion is enabled, as discussed in the
<a href="#opt--inc-recursive"><code>--inc-recursive</code></a> section.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-J"></span><dt id="opt--omit-link-times"><code>--omit-link-times</code>, <code>-J</code><a href="#opt--omit-link-times" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to omit symlinks when it is preserving modification,
access, and create times.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--super"><code>--super</code><a href="#opt--super" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells the receiving side to attempt super-user activities even if the
receiving rsync wasn't run by the super-user.  These activities include:
preserving users via the <a href="#opt--owner"><code>--owner</code></a> option, preserving all groups
(not just the current user's groups) via the <a href="#opt--group"><code>--group</code></a> option, and
copying devices via the <a href="#opt--devices"><code>--devices</code></a> option.  This is useful for
systems that allow such activities without being the super-user, and also
for ensuring that you will get errors if the receiving side isn't being run
as the super-user.  To turn off super-user activities, the super-user can
use <code>--no-super</code>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--fake-super"><code>--fake-super</code><a href="#opt--fake-super" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>When this option is enabled, rsync simulates super-user activities by
saving/restoring the privileged attributes via special extended attributes
that are attached to each file (as needed).  This includes the file's owner
and group (if it is not the default), the file's device info (device &amp;
special files are created as empty text files), and any permission bits
that we won't allow to be set on the real file (e.g. the real file gets
u-s,g-s,o-t for safety) or that would limit the owner's access (since the
real super-user can always access/change a file, the files we create can
always be accessed/changed by the creating user).  This option also handles
ACLs (if <a href="#opt--acls"><code>--acls</code></a> was specified) and non-user extended attributes
(if <a href="#opt--xattrs"><code>--xattrs</code></a> was specified).</p>
<p>This is a good way to backup data without using a super-user, and to store
ACLs from incompatible systems.</p>
<p>The <code>--fake-super</code> option only affects the side where the option is used.
To affect the remote side of a remote-shell connection, use the
<a href="#opt--remote-option"><code>--remote-option</code></a> (<code>-M</code>) option:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av -M--fake-super /src/ host:/dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>For a local copy, this option affects both the source and the destination.
If you wish a local copy to enable this option just for the destination
files, specify <code>-M--fake-super</code>.  If you wish a local copy to enable this
option just for the source files, combine <code>--fake-super</code> with <code>-M--super</code>.</p>
<p>This option is overridden by both <a href="#opt--super"><code>--super</code></a> and <code>--no-super</code>.</p>
<p>See also the <a href="rsyncd.conf.5#fake_super"><code>fake super</code></a> setting in the
daemon's rsyncd.conf file.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-S"></span><dt id="opt--sparse"><code>--sparse</code>, <code>-S</code><a href="#opt--sparse" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Try to handle sparse files efficiently so they take up less space on the
destination.  If combined with <a href="#opt--inplace"><code>--inplace</code></a> the file created might
not end up with sparse blocks with some combinations of kernel version
and/or filesystem type.  If <a href="#opt--whole-file"><code>--whole-file</code></a> is in effect (e.g. for a
local copy) then it will always work because rsync truncates the file prior
to writing out the updated version.</p>
<p>Note that versions of rsync older than 3.1.3 will reject the combination of
<code>--sparse</code> and <a href="#opt--inplace"><code>--inplace</code></a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--preallocate"><code>--preallocate</code><a href="#opt--preallocate" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells the receiver to allocate each destination file to its eventual
size before writing data to the file.  Rsync will only use the real
filesystem-level preallocation support provided by Linux's <strong>fallocate</strong>(2)
system call or Cygwin's <strong>posix_fallocate</strong>(3), not the slow glibc
implementation that writes a null byte into each block.</p>
<p>Without this option, larger files may not be entirely contiguous on the
filesystem, but with this option rsync will probably copy more slowly.  If
the destination is not an extent-supporting filesystem (such as ext4, xfs,
NTFS, etc.), this option may have no positive effect at all.</p>
<p>If combined with <a href="#opt--sparse"><code>--sparse</code></a>, the file will only have sparse blocks
(as opposed to allocated sequences of null bytes) if the kernel version and
filesystem type support creating holes in the allocated data.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-n"></span><dt id="opt--dry-run"><code>--dry-run</code>, <code>-n</code><a href="#opt--dry-run" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This makes rsync perform a trial run that doesn't make any changes (and
produces mostly the same output as a real run).  It is most commonly used
in combination with the <a href="#opt--verbose"><code>--verbose</code></a> (<code>-v</code>) and/or
<a href="#opt--itemize-changes"><code>--itemize-changes</code></a> (<code>-i</code>) options to see what an rsync command is
going to do before one actually runs it.</p>
<p>The output of <a href="#opt--itemize-changes"><code>--itemize-changes</code></a> is supposed to be exactly the
same on a dry run and a subsequent real run (barring intentional trickery
and system call failures); if it isn't, that's a bug.  Other output should
be mostly unchanged, but may differ in some areas.  Notably, a dry run does
not send the actual data for file transfers, so <a href="#opt--progress"><code>--progress</code></a> has no
effect, the &quot;bytes sent&quot;, &quot;bytes received&quot;, &quot;literal data&quot;, and &quot;matched
data&quot; statistics are too small, and the &quot;speedup&quot; value is equivalent to a
run where no file transfers were needed.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-W"></span><dt id="opt--whole-file"><code>--whole-file</code>, <code>-W</code><a href="#opt--whole-file" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option disables rsync's delta-transfer algorithm, which causes all
transferred files to be sent whole.  The transfer may be faster if this
option is used when the bandwidth between the source and destination
machines is higher than the bandwidth to disk (especially when the &quot;disk&quot;
is actually a networked filesystem).  This is the default when both the
source and destination are specified as local paths, but only if no
batch-writing option is in effect.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt--no-W"></span><dt id="opt--no-whole-file"><code>--no-whole-file</code>, <code>--no-W</code><a href="#opt--no-whole-file" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Disable whole-file updating when it is enabled by default for a local
transfer.  This usually slows rsync down, but it can be useful if you are
trying to minimize the writes to the destination file (if combined with
<a href="#opt--inplace"><code>--inplace</code></a>) or for testing the checksum-based update algorithm.</p>
<p>See also the <a href="#opt--whole-file"><code>--whole-file</code></a> option.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt--cc"></span><dt id="opt--checksum-choice"><code>--checksum-choice=STR</code>, <code>--cc=STR</code><a href="#opt--checksum-choice" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option overrides the checksum algorithms.  If one algorithm name is
specified, it is used for both the transfer checksums and (assuming
<a href="#opt--checksum"><code>--checksum</code></a> is specified) the pre-transfer checksums.  If two
comma-separated names are supplied, the first name affects the transfer
checksums, and the second name affects the pre-transfer checksums (<code>-c</code>).</p>
<p>The checksum options that you may be able to use are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>auto</code> (the default automatic choice)</li>
<li><code>xxh128</code></li>
<li><code>xxh3</code></li>
<li><code>xxh64</code> (aka <code>xxhash</code>)</li>
<li><code>md5</code></li>
<li><code>md4</code></li>
<li><code>sha1</code></li>
<li><code>none</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Run <code>rsync --version</code> to see the default checksum list compiled into your
version (which may differ from the list above).</p>
<p>If &quot;none&quot; is specified for the first (or only) name, the <a href="#opt--whole-file"><code>--whole-file</code></a>
option is forced on and no checksum verification is performed on the
transferred data.  If &quot;none&quot; is specified for the second (or only) name,
the <a href="#opt--checksum"><code>--checksum</code></a> option cannot be used.</p>
<p>The &quot;auto&quot; option is the default, where rsync bases its algorithm choice on
a negotiation between the client and the server as follows:</p>
<p>When both sides of the transfer are at least 3.2.0, rsync chooses the first
algorithm in the client's list of choices that is also in the server's list
of choices.  If no common checksum choice is found, rsync exits with
an error.  If the remote rsync is too old to support checksum negotiation,
a value is chosen based on the protocol version (which chooses between MD5
and various flavors of MD4 based on protocol age).</p>
<p>The default order can be customized by setting the environment variable
<a href="#RSYNC_CHECKSUM_LIST"><code>RSYNC_CHECKSUM_LIST</code></a> to a space-separated list of acceptable checksum
names.  If the string contains a &quot;<code>&amp;</code>&quot; character, it is separated into the
&quot;client string &amp; server string&quot;, otherwise the same string applies to both.
If the string (or string portion) contains no non-whitespace characters,
the default checksum list is used.  This method does not allow you to
specify the transfer checksum separately from the pre-transfer checksum,
and it discards &quot;auto&quot; and all unknown checksum names.  A list with only
invalid names results in a failed negotiation.</p>
<p>The use of the <code>--checksum-choice</code> option overrides this environment list.</p>

<span id="opt-x"></span><dt id="opt--one-file-system"><code>--one-file-system</code>, <code>-x</code><a href="#opt--one-file-system" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to avoid crossing a filesystem boundary when recursing.
This does not limit the user's ability to specify items to copy from
multiple filesystems, just rsync's recursion through the hierarchy of each
directory that the user specified, and also the analogous recursion on the
receiving side during deletion.  Also keep in mind that rsync treats a
&quot;bind&quot; mount to the same device as being on the same filesystem.</p>
<p>If this option is repeated, rsync omits all mount-point directories from
the copy.  Otherwise, it includes an empty directory at each mount-point it
encounters (using the attributes of the mounted directory because those of
the underlying mount-point directory are inaccessible).</p>
<p>If rsync has been told to collapse symlinks (via <a href="#opt--copy-links"><code>--copy-links</code></a> or
<a href="#opt--copy-unsafe-links"><code>--copy-unsafe-links</code></a>), a symlink to a directory on another device
is treated like a mount-point.  Symlinks to non-directories are unaffected
by this option.</p>

<span id="opt--existing"></span><dt id="opt--ignore-non-existing"><code>--ignore-non-existing</code>, <code>--existing</code><a href="#opt--ignore-non-existing" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to skip creating files (including directories) that do not
exist yet on the destination.  If this option is combined with the
<a href="#opt--ignore-existing"><code>--ignore-existing</code></a> option, no files will be updated (which can be
useful if all you want to do is delete extraneous files).</p>
<p>This option is a <a href="#TRANSFER_RULES">TRANSFER RULE</a>, so don't expect any
exclude side effects.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--ignore-existing"><code>--ignore-existing</code><a href="#opt--ignore-existing" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to skip updating files that already exist on the
destination (this does <u>not</u> ignore existing directories, or nothing would
get done).  See also <a href="#opt--ignore-non-existing"><code>--ignore-non-existing</code></a>.</p>
<p>This option is a <a href="#TRANSFER_RULES">TRANSFER RULE</a>, so don't expect any
exclude side effects.</p>
<p>This option can be useful for those doing backups using the
<a href="#opt--link-dest"><code>--link-dest</code></a> option when they need to continue a backup run that
got interrupted.  Since a <a href="#opt--link-dest"><code>--link-dest</code></a> run is copied into a new
directory hierarchy (when it is used properly), using [<code>--ignore-existing</code>
will ensure that the already-handled files don't get tweaked (which avoids
a change in permissions on the hard-linked files).  This does mean that
this option is only looking at the existing files in the destination
hierarchy itself.</p>
<p>When <a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=skip2</code></a> is used rsync will output &quot;FILENAME exists
(INFO)&quot; messages where the INFO indicates one of &quot;type change&quot;, &quot;sum
change&quot; (requires <a href="#opt-c"><code>-c</code></a>), &quot;file change&quot; (based on the quick check),
&quot;attr change&quot;, or &quot;uptodate&quot;.  Using <a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=skip1</code></a> (which is also
implied by 2 <a href="#opt-v"><code>-v</code></a> options) outputs the exists message without the
INFO suffix.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--remove-source-files"><code>--remove-source-files</code><a href="#opt--remove-source-files" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to remove from the sending side the files (meaning
non-directories) that are a part of the transfer and have been successfully
duplicated on the receiving side.</p>
<p>Note that you should only use this option on source files that are
quiescent.  If you are using this to move files that show up in a
particular directory over to another host, make sure that the finished
files get renamed into the source directory, not directly written into it,
so that rsync can't possibly transfer a file that is not yet fully written.
If you can't first write the files into a different directory, you should
use a naming idiom that lets rsync avoid transferring files that are not
yet finished (e.g. name the file &quot;foo.new&quot; when it is written, rename it to
&quot;foo&quot; when it is done, and then use the option <a href="#opt--exclude"><code>--exclude='*.new'</code></a>
for the rsync transfer).</p>
<p>Starting with 3.1.0, rsync will skip the sender-side removal (and output an
error) if the file's size or modify time has not stayed unchanged.</p>
<p>Starting with 3.2.6, a local rsync copy will ensure that the sender does
not remove a file the receiver just verified, such as when the user
accidentally makes the source and destination directory the same path.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--delete"><code>--delete</code><a href="#opt--delete" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to delete extraneous files from the receiving side (ones
that aren't on the sending side), but only for the directories that are
being synchronized.  You must have asked rsync to send the whole directory
(e.g. &quot;<code>dir</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>dir/</code>&quot;) without using a wildcard for the directory's
contents (e.g. &quot;<code>dir/*</code>&quot;) since the wildcard is expanded by the shell and
rsync thus gets a request to transfer individual files, not the files'
parent directory.  Files that are excluded from the transfer are also
excluded from being deleted unless you use the <a href="#opt--delete-excluded"><code>--delete-excluded</code></a>
option or mark the rules as only matching on the sending side (see the
include/exclude modifiers in the <a href="#FILTER_RULES">FILTER RULES</a> section).</p>
<p>Prior to rsync 2.6.7, this option would have no effect unless
<a href="#opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code></a> was enabled.  Beginning with 2.6.7, deletions will
also occur when <a href="#opt--dirs"><code>--dirs</code></a> (<code>-d</code>) is enabled, but only for
directories whose contents are being copied.</p>
<p>This option can be dangerous if used incorrectly! It is a very good idea to
first try a run using the <a href="#opt--dry-run"><code>--dry-run</code></a> (<code>-n</code>) option to see what
files are going to be deleted.</p>
<p>If the sending side detects any I/O errors, then the deletion of any files
at the destination will be automatically disabled.  This is to prevent
temporary filesystem failures (such as NFS errors) on the sending side from
causing a massive deletion of files on the destination.  You can override
this with the <a href="#opt--ignore-errors"><code>--ignore-errors</code></a> option.</p>
<p>The <code>--delete</code> option may be combined with one of the -&#8288;-&#8288;delete-WHEN options
without conflict, as well as <a href="#opt--delete-excluded"><code>--delete-excluded</code></a>.  However, if none
of the <code>--delete-WHEN</code> options are specified, rsync will choose the
<a href="#opt--delete-during"><code>--delete-during</code></a> algorithm when talking to rsync 3.0.0 or newer,
or the <a href="#opt--delete-before"><code>--delete-before</code></a> algorithm when talking to an older rsync.

<p>Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done before the
transfer starts.  See <a href="#opt--delete"><code>--delete</code></a> (which is implied) for more
details on file-deletion.</p>
<p>Deleting before the transfer is helpful if the filesystem is tight for
space and removing extraneous files would help to make the transfer
possible.  However, it does introduce a delay before the start of the
transfer, and this delay might cause the transfer to timeout (if
<a href="#opt--timeout"><code>--timeout</code></a> was specified).  It also forces rsync to use the old,
non-incremental recursion algorithm that requires rsync to scan all the
files in the transfer into memory at once (see <a href="#opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code></a>).</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt--del"></span><dt id="opt--delete-during"><code>--delete-during</code>, <code>--del</code><a href="#opt--delete-during" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done incrementally
as the transfer happens.  The per-directory delete scan is done right
before each directory is checked for updates, so it behaves like a more
efficient <a href="#opt--delete-before"><code>--delete-before</code></a>, including doing the deletions prior to
any per-directory filter files being updated.  This option was first added
in rsync version 2.6.4.  See <a href="#opt--delete"><code>--delete</code></a> (which is implied) for more
details on file-deletion.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--delete-delay"><code>--delete-delay</code><a href="#opt--delete-delay" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be computed during
the transfer (like <a href="#opt--delete-during"><code>--delete-during</code></a>), and then removed after the
transfer completes.  This is useful when combined with
<a href="#opt--delay-updates"><code>--delay-updates</code></a> and/or <a href="#opt--fuzzy"><code>--fuzzy</code></a>, and is more efficient
than using <a href="#opt--delete-after"><code>--delete-after</code></a> (but can behave differently, since
<a href="#opt--delete-after"><code>--delete-after</code></a> computes the deletions in a separate pass after
all updates are done).  If the number of removed files overflows an
internal buffer, a temporary file will be created on the receiving side to
hold the names (it is removed while open, so you shouldn't see it during
the transfer).  If the creation of the temporary file fails, rsync will try
to fall back to using <a href="#opt--delete-after"><code>--delete-after</code></a> (which it cannot do if
<a href="#opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code></a> is doing an incremental scan).  See
<a href="#opt--delete"><code>--delete</code></a> (which is implied) for more details on file-deletion.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--delete-after"><code>--delete-after</code><a href="#opt--delete-after" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done after the
transfer has completed.  This is useful if you are sending new
per-directory merge files as a part of the transfer and you want their
exclusions to take effect for the delete phase of the current transfer.  It
also forces rsync to use the old, non-incremental recursion algorithm that
requires rsync to scan all the files in the transfer into memory at once
(see <a href="#opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code></a>). See <a href="#opt--delete"><code>--delete</code></a> (which is implied) for
more details on file-deletion.</p>
<p>See also the <a href="#opt--delete-delay"><code>--delete-delay</code></a> option that might be a faster choice
for those that just want the deletions to occur at the end of the transfer.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--delete-excluded"><code>--delete-excluded</code><a href="#opt--delete-excluded" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option turns any unqualified exclude/include rules into server-side
rules that do not affect the receiver's deletions.</p>
<p>By default, an exclude or include has both a server-side effect (to &quot;hide&quot;
and &quot;show&quot; files when building the server's file list) and a receiver-side
effect (to &quot;protect&quot; and &quot;risk&quot; files when deletions are occurring).  Any
rule that has no modifier to specify what sides it is executed on will be
instead treated as if it were a server-side rule only, avoiding any
&quot;protect&quot; effects of the rules.</p>
<p>A rule can still apply to both sides even with this option specified if the
rule is given both the sender &amp; receiver modifier letters (e.g., <code>-f'-sr foo'</code>).  Receiver-side protect/risk rules can also be explicitly specified
to limit the deletions.  This saves you from having to edit a bunch of
<code>-f'- foo'</code> rules into <code>-f'-s foo'</code> (aka <code>-f'H foo'</code>) rules (not to mention
the corresponding includes).</p>
<p>See the <a href="#FILTER_RULES">FILTER RULES</a> section for more information.  See

<dt id="opt--ignore-missing-args"><code>--ignore-missing-args</code><a href="#opt--ignore-missing-args" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>When rsync is first processing the explicitly requested source files (e.g.
command-line arguments or <a href="#opt--files-from"><code>--files-from</code></a> entries), it is normally
an error if the file cannot be found.  This option suppresses that error,
and does not try to transfer the file.  This does not affect subsequent
vanished-file errors if a file was initially found to be present and later
is no longer there.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--delete-missing-args"><code>--delete-missing-args</code><a href="#opt--delete-missing-args" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option takes the behavior of the (implied)
<a href="#opt--ignore-missing-args"><code>--ignore-missing-args</code></a> option a step farther: each missing arg
will become a deletion request of the corresponding destination file on the
receiving side (should it exist).  If the destination file is a non-empty
directory, it will only be successfully deleted if <a href="#opt--force"><code>--force</code></a> or
<a href="#opt--delete"><code>--delete</code></a> are in effect.  Other than that, this option is
independent of any other type of delete processing.</p>
<p>The missing source files are represented by special file-list entries which
display as a &quot;<code>*missing</code>&quot; entry in the <a href="#opt--list-only"><code>--list-only</code></a> output.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--ignore-errors"><code>--ignore-errors</code><a href="#opt--ignore-errors" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>

I/O errors.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--force"><code>--force</code><a href="#opt--force" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option tells rsync to delete a non-empty directory when it is to be
replaced by a non-directory.  This is only relevant if deletions are not
active (see <a href="#opt--delete"><code>--delete</code></a> for details).</p>
<p>Note for older rsync versions: <code>--force</code> used to still be required when
using <a href="#opt--delete-after"><code>--delete-after</code></a>, and it used to be non-functional unless the
<a href="#opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code></a> option was also enabled.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--max-delete"><code>--max-delete=NUM</code><a href="#opt--max-delete" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync not to delete more than NUM files or directories.  If that
limit is exceeded, all further deletions are skipped through the end of the
transfer.  At the end, rsync outputs a warning (including a count of the
skipped deletions) and exits with an error code of 25 (unless some more
important error condition also occurred).</p>
<p>Beginning with version 3.0.0, you may specify <code>--max-delete=0</code> to be warned
about any extraneous files in the destination without removing any of them.
Older clients interpreted this as &quot;unlimited&quot;, so if you don't know what
version the client is, you can use the less obvious <code>--max-delete=-1</code> as a
backward-compatible way to specify that no deletions be allowed (though
really old versions didn't warn when the limit was exceeded).</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--max-size"><code>--max-size=SIZE</code><a href="#opt--max-size" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to avoid transferring any file that is larger than the
specified SIZE.  A numeric value can be suffixed with a string to indicate
the numeric units or left unqualified to specify bytes.  Feel free to use a
fractional value along with the units, such as <code>--max-size=1.5m</code>.</p>
<p>This option is a <a href="#TRANSFER_RULES">TRANSFER RULE</a>, so don't expect any
exclude side effects.</p>
<p>The first letter of a units string can be <code>B</code> (bytes), <code>K</code> (kilo), <code>M</code>
(mega), <code>G</code> (giga), <code>T</code> (tera), or <code>P</code> (peta).  If the string is a single
char or has &quot;ib&quot; added to it (e.g. &quot;G&quot; or &quot;GiB&quot;) then the units are
multiples of 1024.  If you use a two-letter suffix that ends with a &quot;B&quot;
(e.g. &quot;kb&quot;) then you get units that are multiples of 1000.  The string's
letters can be any mix of upper and lower-case that you want to use.</p>
<p>Finally, if the string ends with either &quot;+1&quot; or &quot;-&#8288;1&quot;, it is offset by one
byte in the indicated direction.  The largest possible value is usually
<code>8192P-1</code>.</p>
<p>Examples: <code>--max-size=1.5mb-1</code> is 1499999 bytes, and <code>--max-size=2g+1</code> is
2147483649 bytes.</p>
<p>Note that rsync versions prior to 3.1.0 did not allow <code>--max-size=0</code>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--min-size"><code>--min-size=SIZE</code><a href="#opt--min-size" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to avoid transferring any file that is smaller than the
specified SIZE, which can help in not transferring small, junk files.  See
the <a href="#opt--max-size"><code>--max-size</code></a> option for a description of SIZE and other info.</p>
<p>Note that rsync versions prior to 3.1.0 did not allow <code>--min-size=0</code>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--max-alloc"><code>--max-alloc=SIZE</code><a href="#opt--max-alloc" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>By default rsync limits an individual malloc/realloc to about 1GB in size.
For most people this limit works just fine and prevents a protocol error
causing rsync to request massive amounts of memory.  However, if you have
many millions of files in a transfer, a large amount of server memory, and
you don't want to split up your transfer into multiple parts, you can
increase the per-allocation limit to something larger and rsync will
consume more memory.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is not a limit on the total size of allocated
memory.  It is a sanity-check value for each individual allocation.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#opt--max-size"><code>--max-size</code></a> option for a description of how SIZE can be
specified.  The default suffix if none is given is bytes.</p>
<p>Beginning in 3.2.7, a value of 0 is an easy way to specify SIZE_MAX (the
largest limit possible).</p>
<p>You can set a default value using the environment variable
<a href="#RSYNC_MAX_ALLOC"><code>RSYNC_MAX_ALLOC</code></a> using the same SIZE values as supported by this
option.  If the remote rsync doesn't understand the <code>--max-alloc</code> option,
you can override an environmental value by specifying <code>--max-alloc=1g</code>,
which will make rsync avoid sending the option to the remote side (because
&quot;1G&quot; is the default).</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-B"></span><dt id="opt--block-size"><code>--block-size=SIZE</code>, <code>-B</code><a href="#opt--block-size" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This forces the block size used in rsync's delta-transfer algorithm to a
fixed value.  It is normally selected based on the size of each file being
updated.  See the technical report for details.</p>
<p>Beginning in 3.2.3 the SIZE can be specified with a suffix as detailed in
the <a href="#opt--max-size"><code>--max-size</code></a> option.  Older versions only accepted a byte count.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-e"></span><dt id="opt--rsh"><code>--rsh=COMMAND</code>, <code>-e</code><a href="#opt--rsh" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option allows you to choose an alternative remote shell program to use
for communication between the local and remote copies of rsync.  Typically,
rsync is configured to use ssh by default, but you may prefer to use rsh on
a local network.</p>
<p>If this option is used with <code>[user@]host::module/path</code>, then the remote
shell <u>COMMAND</u> will be used to run an rsync daemon on the remote host, and
all data will be transmitted through that remote shell connection, rather
than through a direct socket connection to a running rsync daemon on the
remote host.  See the <a href="#USING_RSYNC-DAEMON_FEATURES_VIA_A_REMOTE-SHELL_CONNECTION">USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL
CONNECTION</a> section above.</p>
<p>Beginning with rsync 3.2.0, the <a href="#RSYNC_PORT"><code>RSYNC_PORT</code></a> environment variable will
be set when a daemon connection is being made via a remote-shell
connection.  It is set to 0 if the default daemon port is being assumed, or
it is set to the value of the rsync port that was specified via either the
<a href="#opt--port"><code>--port</code></a> option or a non-empty port value in an <code>rsync://</code> URL.
This allows the script to discern if a non-default port is being requested,
allowing for things such as an SSL or stunnel helper script to connect to a
default or alternate port.</p>
<p>Command-line arguments are permitted in COMMAND provided that COMMAND is
presented to rsync as a single argument.  You must use spaces (not tabs or
other whitespace) to separate the command and args from each other, and you
can use single- and/or double-quotes to preserve spaces in an argument (but
not backslashes).  Note that doubling a single-quote inside a single-quoted
string gives you a single-quote; likewise for double-quotes (though you
need to pay attention to which quotes your shell is parsing and which
quotes rsync is parsing).  Some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>-e 'ssh -p 2234'
-e 'ssh -o &quot;ProxyCommand nohup ssh firewall nc -w1 %h %p&quot;'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note that ssh users can alternately customize site-specific connect
options in their .ssh/config file.)</p>
<p>You can also choose the remote shell program using the <a href="#RSYNC_RSH"><code>RSYNC_RSH</code></a>
environment variable, which accepts the same range of values as <code>-e</code>.</p>
<p>See also the <a href="#opt--blocking-io"><code>--blocking-io</code></a> option which is affected by this
option.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--rsync-path"><code>--rsync-path=PROGRAM</code><a href="#opt--rsync-path" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Use this to specify what program is to be run on the remote machine to
start-up rsync.  Often used when rsync is not in the default remote-shell's
path (e.g. <code>--rsync-path=/usr/local/bin/rsync</code>).  Note that PROGRAM is run
with the help of a shell, so it can be any program, script, or command
sequence you'd care to run, so long as it does not corrupt the standard-in
&amp; standard-out that rsync is using to communicate.</p>
<p>One tricky example is to set a different default directory on the remote
machine for use with the <a href="#opt--relative"><code>--relative</code></a> option.  For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -avR --rsync-path=&quot;cd /a/b &amp;&amp; rsync&quot; host:c/d /e/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>

<span id="opt-M"></span><dt id="opt--remote-option"><code>--remote-option=OPTION</code>, <code>-M</code><a href="#opt--remote-option" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option is used for more advanced situations where you want certain
effects to be limited to one side of the transfer only.  For instance, if
you want to pass <a href="#opt--log-file"><code>--log-file=FILE</code></a> and <a href="#opt--fake-super"><code>--fake-super</code></a> to
the remote system, specify it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av -M --log-file=foo -M--fake-super src/ dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to have an option affect only the local side of a transfer when
it normally affects both sides, send its negation to the remote side.  Like
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av -x -M--no-x src/ dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Be cautious using this, as it is possible to toggle an option that will
cause rsync to have a different idea about what data to expect next over
the socket, and that will make it fail in a cryptic fashion.</p>
<p>Note that you should use a separate <code>-M</code> option for each remote option you
want to pass.  On older rsync versions, the presence of any spaces in the
remote-option arg could cause it to be split into separate remote args, but
this requires the use of <a href="#opt--old-args"><code>--old-args</code></a> in a modern rsync.</p>
<p>When performing a local transfer, the &quot;local&quot; side is the sender and the
&quot;remote&quot; side is the receiver.</p>
<p>Note some versions of the popt option-parsing library have a bug in them
that prevents you from using an adjacent arg with an equal in it next to a
short option letter (e.g. <code>-M--log-file=/tmp/foo</code>).  If this bug affects
your version of popt, you can use the version of popt that is included with
rsync.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-C"></span><dt id="opt--cvs-exclude"><code>--cvs-exclude</code>, <code>-C</code><a href="#opt--cvs-exclude" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This is a useful shorthand for excluding a broad range of files that you
often don't want to transfer between systems.  It uses a similar algorithm
to CVS to determine if a file should be ignored.</p>
<p>The exclude list is initialized to exclude the following items (these
initial items are marked as perishable&nbsp;-&#8288;-&#8288; see the <a href="#FILTER_RULES">FILTER RULES</a>
section):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>RCS</code>
<code>SCCS</code>

<code>.git/</code>
<code>.hg/</code>
<code>.bzr/</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>then, files listed in a $HOME/.cvsignore are added to the list and any
files listed in the CVSIGNORE environment variable (all cvsignore names are
delimited by whitespace).</p>
<p>Finally, any file is ignored if it is in the same directory as a .cvsignore
file and matches one of the patterns listed therein.  Unlike rsync's
filter/exclude files, these patterns are split on whitespace.  See the
<strong>cvs</strong>(1) manual for more information.</p>
<p>If you're combining <code>-C</code> with your own <a href="#opt--filter"><code>--filter</code></a> rules, you should
note that these CVS excludes are appended at the end of your own rules,
regardless of where the <code>-C</code> was placed on the command-line.  This makes
them a lower priority than any rules you specified explicitly.  If you want
to control where these CVS excludes get inserted into your filter rules,
you should omit the <code>-C</code> as a command-line option and use a combination of
<a href="#opt--filter"><code>--filter=:C</code></a> and <a href="#opt--filter"><code>--filter=-C</code></a> (either on your
command-line or by putting the &quot;:C&quot; and &quot;-&#8288;C&quot; rules into a filter file with
your other rules).  The first option turns on the per-directory scanning
for the .cvsignore file.  The second option does a one-time import of the
CVS excludes mentioned above.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-f"></span><dt id="opt--filter"><code>--filter=RULE</code>, <code>-f</code><a href="#opt--filter" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option allows you to add rules to selectively exclude certain files
from the list of files to be transferred.  This is most useful in
combination with a recursive transfer.</p>
<p>You may use as many <code>--filter</code> options on the command line as you like to
build up the list of files to exclude.  If the filter contains whitespace,
be sure to quote it so that the shell gives the rule to rsync as a single
argument.  The text below also mentions that you can use an underscore to
replace the space that separates a rule from its arg.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#FILTER_RULES">FILTER RULES</a> section for detailed information on this option.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt-F"><code>-F</code><a href="#opt-F" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>The <code>-F</code> option is a shorthand for adding two <a href="#opt--filter"><code>--filter</code></a> rules to
your command.  The first time it is used is a shorthand for this rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>--filter='dir-merge /.rsync-filter'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This tells rsync to look for per-directory .rsync-filter files that have
been sprinkled through the hierarchy and use their rules to filter the
files in the transfer.  If <code>-F</code> is repeated, it is a shorthand for this
rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>--filter='exclude .rsync-filter'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This filters out the .rsync-filter files themselves from the transfer.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#FILTER_RULES">FILTER RULES</a> section for detailed information on how these
options work.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--exclude"><code>--exclude=PATTERN</code><a href="#opt--exclude" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option is a simplified form of the <a href="#opt--filter"><code>--filter</code></a> option that
specifies an exclude rule and does not allow the full rule-parsing syntax
of normal filter rules.  This is equivalent to specifying <code>-f'- PATTERN'</code>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#FILTER_RULES">FILTER RULES</a> section for detailed information on this option.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--exclude-from"><code>--exclude-from=FILE</code><a href="#opt--exclude-from" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option is related to the <a href="#opt--exclude"><code>--exclude</code></a> option, but it specifies
a FILE that contains exclude patterns (one per line).  Blank lines in the
file are ignored, as are whole-line comments that start with '<code>;</code>' or '<code>#</code>'
(filename rules that contain those characters are unaffected).</p>
<p>If a line begins with &quot;<code>- </code>&quot; (dash, space) or &quot;<code>+ </code>&quot; (plus, space), then
the type of rule is being explicitly specified as an exclude or an include
(respectively).  Any rules without such a prefix are taken to be an exclude.</p>
<p>If a line consists of just &quot;<code>!</code>&quot;, then the current filter rules are cleared
before adding any further rules.</p>
<p>If <u>FILE</u> is '<code>-</code>', the list will be read from standard input.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--include"><code>--include=PATTERN</code><a href="#opt--include" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option is a simplified form of the <a href="#opt--filter"><code>--filter</code></a> option that
specifies an include rule and does not allow the full rule-parsing syntax
of normal filter rules.  This is equivalent to specifying <code>-f'+ PATTERN'</code>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#FILTER_RULES">FILTER RULES</a> section for detailed information on this option.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--include-from"><code>--include-from=FILE</code><a href="#opt--include-from" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option is related to the <a href="#opt--include"><code>--include</code></a> option, but it specifies
a FILE that contains include patterns (one per line).  Blank lines in the
file are ignored, as are whole-line comments that start with '<code>;</code>' or '<code>#</code>'
(filename rules that contain those characters are unaffected).</p>
<p>If a line begins with &quot;<code>- </code>&quot; (dash, space) or &quot;<code>+ </code>&quot; (plus, space), then
the type of rule is being explicitly specified as an exclude or an include

</dd>

<dt id="opt--files-from"><code>--files-from=FILE</code><a href="#opt--files-from" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Using this option allows you to specify the exact list of files to transfer
(as read from the specified FILE or '<code>-</code>' for standard input).  It also
tweaks the default behavior of rsync to make transferring just the
specified files and directories easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="#opt--relative"><code>--relative</code></a> (<code>-R</code>) option is implied, which preserves the
path information that is specified for each item in the file (use
<code>--no-relative</code> or <code>--no-R</code> if you want to turn that off).</li>
<li>The <a href="#opt--dirs"><code>--dirs</code></a> (<code>-d</code>) option is implied, which will create
directories specified in the list on the destination rather than noisily
skipping them (use <code>--no-dirs</code> or <code>--no-d</code> if you want to turn that off).</li>
<li>The <a href="#opt--archive"><code>--archive</code></a> (<code>-a</code>) option's behavior does not imply
<a href="#opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code></a> (<code>-r</code>), so specify it explicitly, if you want it.</li>
<li>These side-effects change the default state of rsync, so the position of
the <code>--files-from</code> option on the command-line has no bearing on how other
options are parsed (e.g. <a href="#opt-a"><code>-a</code></a> works the same before or after
<code>--files-from</code>, as does <code>--no-R</code> and all other options).</li>
</ul>
<p>The filenames that are read from the FILE are all relative to the source
dir&nbsp;-&#8288;-&#8288; any leading slashes are removed and no &quot;..&quot; references are allowed
to go higher than the source dir.  For example, take this command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -a --files-from=/tmp/foo /usr remote:/backup
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If /tmp/foo contains the string &quot;bin&quot; (or even &quot;/bin&quot;), the /usr/bin
directory will be created as /backup/bin on the remote host.  If it
contains &quot;bin/&quot; (note the trailing slash), the immediate contents of the
directory would also be sent (without needing to be explicitly mentioned in
the file&nbsp;-&#8288;-&#8288; this began in version 2.6.4).  In both cases, if the
<a href="#opt-r"><code>-r</code></a> option was enabled, that dir's entire hierarchy would also be
transferred (keep in mind that <a href="#opt-r"><code>-r</code></a> needs to be specified
explicitly with <code>--files-from</code>, since it is not implied by <a href="#opt-a"><code>-a</code></a>.
Also note that the effect of the (enabled by default) <a href="#opt-r"><code>-r</code></a> option
is to duplicate only the path info that is read from the file&nbsp;-&#8288;-&#8288; it does
not force the duplication of the source-spec path (/usr in this case).</p>
<p>In addition, the <code>--files-from</code> file can be read from the remote host
instead of the local host if you specify a &quot;host:&quot; in front of the file
(the host must match one end of the transfer).  As a short-cut, you can
specify just a prefix of &quot;:&quot; to mean &quot;use the remote end of the transfer&quot;.
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -a --files-from=:/path/file-list src:/ /tmp/copy
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This would copy all the files specified in the /path/file-list file that
was located on the remote &quot;src&quot; host.</p>
<p>If the <a href="#opt--iconv"><code>--iconv</code></a> and <a href="#opt--secluded-args"><code>--secluded-args</code></a> options are specified
and the <code>--files-from</code> filenames are being sent from one host to another,
the filenames will be translated from the sending host's charset to the
receiving host's charset.</p>
<p>NOTE: sorting the list of files in the <code>--files-from</code> input helps rsync to
be more efficient, as it will avoid re-visiting the path elements that are
shared between adjacent entries.  If the input is not sorted, some path
elements (implied directories) may end up being scanned multiple times, and
rsync will eventually unduplicate them after they get turned into file-list
elements.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-0"></span><dt id="opt--from0"><code>--from0</code>, <code>-0</code><a href="#opt--from0" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync that the rules/filenames it reads from a file are
terminated by a null ('\0') character, not a NL, CR, or CR+LF.  This
affects <a href="#opt--exclude-from"><code>--exclude-from</code></a>, <a href="#opt--include-from"><code>--include-from</code></a>,
<a href="#opt--files-from"><code>--files-from</code></a>, and any merged files specified in a
<a href="#opt--filter"><code>--filter</code></a> rule.  It does not affect <a href="#opt--cvs-exclude"><code>--cvs-exclude</code></a> (since
all names read from a .cvsignore file are split on whitespace).</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--old-args"><code>--old-args</code><a href="#opt--old-args" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option tells rsync to stop trying to protect the arg values on the
remote side from unintended word-splitting or other misinterpretation.
It also allows the client to treat an empty arg as a &quot;.&quot; instead of
generating an error.</p>
<p>The default in a modern rsync is for &quot;shell-active&quot; characters (including
spaces) to be backslash-escaped in the args that are sent to the remote
shell.  The wildcard characters <code>*</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>[</code>, &amp; <code>]</code> are not escaped in
filename args (allowing them to expand into multiple filenames) while being
protected in option args, such as <a href="#opt--usermap"><code>--usermap</code></a>.</p>
<p>If you have a script that wants to use old-style arg splitting in its
filenames, specify this option once.  If the remote shell has a problem
with any backslash escapes at all, specify this option twice.</p>
<p>You may also control this setting via the <a href="#RSYNC_OLD_ARGS"><code>RSYNC_OLD_ARGS</code></a> environment
variable.  If it has the value &quot;1&quot;, rsync will default to a single-option
setting.  If it has the value &quot;2&quot; (or more), rsync will default to a
repeated-option setting.  If it is &quot;0&quot;, you'll get the default escaping
behavior.  The environment is always overridden by manually specified
positive or negative options (the negative is <code>--no-old-args</code>).</p>
<p>Note that this option also disables the extra safety check added in 3.2.5
that ensures that a remote sender isn't including extra top-level items in
the file-list that you didn't request.  This side-effect is necessary
because we can't know for sure what names to expect when the remote shell
is interpreting the args.</p>
<p>This option conflicts with the <a href="#opt--secluded-args"><code>--secluded-args</code></a> option.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-s"></span><dt id="opt--secluded-args"><code>--secluded-args</code>, <code>-s</code><a href="#opt--secluded-args" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option sends all filenames and most options to the remote rsync via
the protocol (not the remote shell command line) which avoids letting the
remote shell modify them.  Wildcards are expanded on the remote host by
rsync instead of a shell.</p>
<p>This is similar to the default backslash-escaping of args that was added
in 3.2.4 (see <a href="#opt--old-args"><code>--old-args</code></a>) in that it prevents things like space
splitting and unwanted special-character side-effects. However, it has the
drawbacks of being incompatible with older rsync versions (prior to 3.0.0)
and of being refused by restricted shells that want to be able to inspect
all the option values for safety.</p>
<p>This option is useful for those times that you need the argument's
character set to be converted for the remote host, if the remote shell is
incompatible with the default backslash-escpaing method, or there is some
other reason that you want the majority of the options and arguments to
bypass the command-line of the remote shell.</p>
<p>If you combine this option with <a href="#opt--iconv"><code>--iconv</code></a>, the args related to the
remote side will be translated from the local to the remote character-set.
The translation happens before wild-cards are expanded.  See also the
<a href="#opt--files-from"><code>--files-from</code></a> option.</p>
<p>You may also control this setting via the <a href="#RSYNC_PROTECT_ARGS"><code>RSYNC_PROTECT_ARGS</code></a>
environment variable.  If it has a non-zero value, this setting will be
enabled by default, otherwise it will be disabled by default.  Either state
is overridden by a manually specified positive or negative version of this
option (note that <code>--no-s</code> and <code>--no-secluded-args</code> are the negative
versions).  This environment variable is also superseded by a non-zero
<a href="#RSYNC_OLD_ARGS"><code>RSYNC_OLD_ARGS</code></a> export.</p>
<p>This option conflicts with the <a href="#opt--old-args"><code>--old-args</code></a> option.</p>
<p>This option used to be called <code>--protect-args</code> (before 3.2.6) and that
older name can still be used (though specifying it as <code>-s</code> is always the
easiest and most compatible choice).</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--trust-sender"><code>--trust-sender</code><a href="#opt--trust-sender" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option disables two extra validation checks that a local client
performs on the file list generated by a remote sender.  This option should
only be used if you trust the sender to not put something malicious in the
file list (something that could possibly be done via a modified rsync, a
modified shell, or some other similar manipulation).</p>
<p>Normally, the rsync client (as of version 3.2.5) runs two extra validation
checks when pulling files from a remote rsync:</p>
<ul>
<li>It verifies that additional arg items didn't get added at the top of the
transfer.</li>
<li>It verifies that none of the items in the file list are names that should
have been excluded (if filter rules were specified).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that various options can turn off one or both of these checks if the
option interferes with the validation.  For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a per-directory filter file reads filter rules that only the server
knows about, so the filter checking is disabled.</li>
<li>Using the <a href="#opt--old-args"><code>--old-args</code></a> option allows the sender to manipulate the
requested args, so the arg checking is disabled.</li>
<li>Reading the files-from list from the server side means that the client
doesn't know the arg list, so the arg checking is disabled.</li>
<li>Using <a href="#opt--read-batch"><code>--read-batch</code></a> disables both checks since the batch file's
contents will have been verified when it was created.</li>
</ul>
<p>This option may help an under-powered client server if the extra pattern
matching is slowing things down on a huge transfer.  It can also be used to
work around a currently-unknown bug in the verification logic for a transfer
from a trusted sender.</p>
<p>When using this option it is a good idea to specify a dedicated destination
directory, as discussed in the <a href="#MULTI-HOST_SECURITY">MULTI-HOST SECURITY</a> section.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--copy-as"><code>--copy-as=USER[:GROUP]</code><a href="#opt--copy-as" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option instructs rsync to use the USER and (if specified after a
colon) the GROUP for the copy operations.  This only works if the user that
is running rsync has the ability to change users.  If the group is not
specified then the user's default groups are used.</p>
<p>This option can help to reduce the risk of an rsync being run as root into
or out of a directory that might have live changes happening to it and you
want to make sure that root-level read or write actions of system files are
not possible.  While you could alternatively run all of rsync as the
specified user, sometimes you need the root-level host-access credentials
to be used, so this allows rsync to drop root for the copying part of the
operation after the remote-shell or daemon connection is established.</p>
<p>The option only affects one side of the transfer unless the transfer is
local, in which case it affects both sides.  Use the
<a href="#opt--remote-option"><code>--remote-option</code></a> to affect the remote side, such as
<code>-M--copy-as=joe</code>.  For a local transfer, the lsh (or lsh.sh) support file
provides a local-shell helper script that can be used to allow a
&quot;localhost:&quot; or &quot;lh:&quot; host-spec to be specified without needing to setup
any remote shells, allowing you to specify remote options that affect the
side of the transfer that is using the host-spec (and using hostname &quot;lh&quot;
avoids the overriding of the remote directory to the user's home dir).</p>
<p>For example, the following rsync writes the local files as user &quot;joe&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>sudo rsync -aiv --copy-as=joe host1:backups/joe/ /home/joe/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes all files owned by user &quot;joe&quot;, limits the groups to those that
are available to that user, and makes it impossible for the joe user to do
a timed exploit of the path to induce a change to a file that the joe user
has no permissions to change.</p>
<p>The following command does a local copy into the &quot;dest/&quot; dir as user &quot;joe&quot;
(assuming you've installed support/lsh into a dir on your $PATH):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>sudo rsync -aive lsh -M--copy-as=joe src/ lh:dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>

<span id="opt-T"></span><dt id="opt--temp-dir"><code>--temp-dir=DIR</code>, <code>-T</code><a href="#opt--temp-dir" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option instructs rsync to use DIR as a scratch directory when creating
temporary copies of the files transferred on the receiving side.  The
default behavior is to create each temporary file in the same directory as
the associated destination file.  Beginning with rsync 3.1.1, the temp-file
names inside the specified DIR will not be prefixed with an extra dot
(though they will still have a random suffix added).</p>
<p>This option is most often used when the receiving disk partition does not
have enough free space to hold a copy of the largest file in the transfer.
In this case (i.e. when the scratch directory is on a different disk
partition), rsync will not be able to rename each received temporary file
over the top of the associated destination file, but instead must copy it
into place.  Rsync does this by copying the file over the top of the
destination file, which means that the destination file will contain
truncated data during this copy.  If this were not done this way (even if
the destination file were first removed, the data locally copied to a
temporary file in the destination directory, and then renamed into place)
it would be possible for the old file to continue taking up disk space (if
someone had it open), and thus there might not be enough room to fit the
new version on the disk at the same time.</p>
<p>If you are using this option for reasons other than a shortage of disk
space, you may wish to combine it with the <a href="#opt--delay-updates"><code>--delay-updates</code></a>
option, which will ensure that all copied files get put into subdirectories
in the destination hierarchy, awaiting the end of the transfer.  If you
don't have enough room to duplicate all the arriving files on the
destination partition, another way to tell rsync that you aren't overly
concerned about disk space is to use the <a href="#opt--partial-dir"><code>--partial-dir</code></a> option
with a relative path; because this tells rsync that it is OK to stash off a
copy of a single file in a subdir in the destination hierarchy, rsync will
use the partial-dir as a staging area to bring over the copied file, and
then rename it into place from there. (Specifying a <a href="#opt--partial-dir"><code>--partial-dir</code></a>
with an absolute path does not have this side-effect.)</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-y"></span><dt id="opt--fuzzy"><code>--fuzzy</code>, <code>-y</code><a href="#opt--fuzzy" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option tells rsync that it should look for a basis file for any
destination file that is missing.  The current algorithm looks in the same
directory as the destination file for either a file that has an identical
size and modified-time, or a similarly-named file.  If found, rsync uses
the fuzzy basis file to try to speed up the transfer.</p>
<p>If the option is repeated, the fuzzy scan will also be done in any matching
alternate destination directories that are specified via
<a href="#opt--compare-dest"><code>--compare-dest</code></a>, <a href="#opt--copy-dest"><code>--copy-dest</code></a>, or <a href="#opt--link-dest"><code>--link-dest</code></a>.</p>
<p>Note that the use of the <a href="#opt--delete"><code>--delete</code></a> option might get rid of any
potential fuzzy-match files, so either use <a href="#opt--delete-after"><code>--delete-after</code></a> or
specify some filename exclusions if you need to prevent this.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--compare-dest"><code>--compare-dest=DIR</code><a href="#opt--compare-dest" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option instructs rsync to use <u>DIR</u> on the destination machine as an
additional hierarchy to compare destination files against doing transfers
(if the files are missing in the destination directory).  If a file is
found in <u>DIR</u> that is identical to the sender's file, the file will NOT be
transferred to the destination directory.  This is useful for creating a
sparse backup of just files that have changed from an earlier backup.  This
option is typically used to copy into an empty (or newly created)
directory.</p>
<p>Beginning in version 2.6.4, multiple <code>--compare-dest</code> directories may be
provided, which will cause rsync to search the list in the order specified
for an exact match.  If a match is found that differs only in attributes, a
local copy is made and the attributes updated.  If a match is not found, a
basis file from one of the <u>DIRs</u> will be selected to try to speed up the
transfer.</p>
<p>If <u>DIR</u> is a relative path, it is relative to the destination directory.
See also <a href="#opt--copy-dest"><code>--copy-dest</code></a> and <a href="#opt--link-dest"><code>--link-dest</code></a>.</p>
<p>NOTE: beginning with version 3.1.0, rsync will remove a file from a
non-empty destination hierarchy if an exact match is found in one of the
compare-dest hierarchies (making the end result more closely match a fresh
copy).</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--copy-dest"><code>--copy-dest=DIR</code><a href="#opt--copy-dest" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option behaves like <a href="#opt--compare-dest"><code>--compare-dest</code></a>, but rsync will also copy
unchanged files found in <u>DIR</u> to the destination directory using a local
copy.  This is useful for doing transfers to a new destination while
leaving existing files intact, and then doing a flash-cutover when all
files have been successfully transferred.</p>
<p>Multiple <code>--copy-dest</code> directories may be provided, which will cause rsync
to search the list in the order specified for an unchanged file.  If a
match is not found, a basis file from one of the <u>DIRs</u> will be selected to
try to speed up the transfer.</p>
<p>If <u>DIR</u> is a relative path, it is relative to the destination directory.
See also <a href="#opt--compare-dest"><code>--compare-dest</code></a> and <a href="#opt--link-dest"><code>--link-dest</code></a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--link-dest"><code>--link-dest=DIR</code><a href="#opt--link-dest" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option behaves like <a href="#opt--copy-dest"><code>--copy-dest</code></a>, but unchanged files are
hard linked from <u>DIR</u> to the destination directory.  The files must be
identical in all preserved attributes (e.g. permissions, possibly
ownership) in order for the files to be linked together.  An example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av --link-dest=$PWD/prior_dir host:src_dir/ new_dir/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If files aren't linking, double-check their attributes.  Also check if
some attributes are getting forced outside of rsync's control, such a mount
option that squishes root to a single user, or mounts a removable drive
with generic ownership (such as OS X's &quot;Ignore ownership on this volume&quot;
option).</p>
<p>Beginning in version 2.6.4, multiple <code>--link-dest</code> directories may be
provided, which will cause rsync to search the list in the order specified
for an exact match (there is a limit of 20 such directories).  If a match
is found that differs only in attributes, a local copy is made and the
attributes updated.  If a match is not found, a basis file from one of the
<u>DIRs</u> will be selected to try to speed up the transfer.</p>
<p>This option works best when copying into an empty destination hierarchy, as
existing files may get their attributes tweaked, and that can affect
alternate destination files via hard-links.  Also, itemizing of changes can
get a bit muddled.  Note that prior to version 3.1.0, an
alternate-directory exact match would never be found (nor linked into the
destination) when a destination file already exists.</p>
<p>Note that if you combine this option with <a href="#opt--ignore-times"><code>--ignore-times</code></a>, rsync will not
link any files together because it only links identical files together as a
substitute for transferring the file, never as an additional check after
the file is updated.</p>
<p>If <u>DIR</u> is a relative path, it is relative to the destination directory.
See also <a href="#opt--compare-dest"><code>--compare-dest</code></a> and <a href="#opt--copy-dest"><code>--copy-dest</code></a>.</p>
<p>Note that rsync versions prior to 2.6.1 had a bug that could prevent
<code>--link-dest</code> from working properly for a non-super-user when
<a href="#opt--owner"><code>--owner</code></a> (<code>-o</code>) was specified (or implied).  You can work-around
this bug by avoiding the <code>-o</code> option (or using <code>--no-o</code>) when sending to an
old rsync.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-z"></span><dt id="opt--compress"><code>--compress</code>, <code>-z</code><a href="#opt--compress" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>With this option, rsync compresses the file data as it is sent to the
destination machine, which reduces the amount of data being transmitted&nbsp;-&#8288;-&#8288;
something that is useful over a slow connection.</p>
<p>Rsync supports multiple compression methods and will choose one for you
unless you force the choice using the <a href="#opt--compress-choice"><code>--compress-choice</code></a> (<code>--zc</code>)
option.</p>
<p>Run <code>rsync --version</code> to see the default compress list compiled into your
version.</p>
<p>When both sides of the transfer are at least 3.2.0, rsync chooses the first
algorithm in the client's list of choices that is also in the server's list
of choices.  If no common compress choice is found, rsync exits with
an error.  If the remote rsync is too old to support checksum negotiation,
its list is assumed to be &quot;zlib&quot;.</p>
<p>The default order can be customized by setting the environment variable
<a href="#RSYNC_COMPRESS_LIST"><code>RSYNC_COMPRESS_LIST</code></a> to a space-separated list of acceptable
compression names.  If the string contains a &quot;<code>&amp;</code>&quot; character, it is
separated into the &quot;client string &amp; server string&quot;, otherwise the same
string applies to both.  If the string (or string portion) contains no
non-whitespace characters, the default compress list is used.  Any unknown
compression names are discarded from the list, but a list with only invalid
names results in a failed negotiation.</p>
<p>There are some older rsync versions that were configured to reject a <code>-z</code>
option and require the use of <code>-zz</code> because their compression library was
not compatible with the default zlib compression method.  You can usually
ignore this weirdness unless the rsync server complains and tells you to
specify <code>-zz</code>.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt--zc"></span><dt id="opt--compress-choice"><code>--compress-choice=STR</code>, <code>--zc=STR</code><a href="#opt--compress-choice" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option can be used to override the automatic negotiation of the
compression algorithm that occurs when <a href="#opt--compress"><code>--compress</code></a> is used.  The
option implies <a href="#opt--compress"><code>--compress</code></a> unless &quot;none&quot; was specified, which
instead implies <code>--no-compress</code>.</p>
<p>The compression options that you may be able to use are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>zstd</code></li>
<li><code>lz4</code></li>
<li><code>zlibx</code></li>
<li><code>zlib</code></li>
<li><code>none</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Run <code>rsync --version</code> to see the default compress list compiled into your
version (which may differ from the list above).</p>
<p>Note that if you see an error about an option named <code>--old-compress</code> or
<code>--new-compress</code>, this is rsync trying to send the <code>--compress-choice=zlib</code>
or <code>--compress-choice=zlibx</code> option in a backward-compatible manner that
more rsync versions understand.  This error indicates that the older rsync
version on the server will not allow you to force the compression type.</p>
<p>Note that the &quot;zlibx&quot; compression algorithm is just the &quot;zlib&quot; algorithm
with matched data excluded from the compression stream (to try to make it
more compatible with an external zlib implementation).</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt--zl"></span><dt id="opt--compress-level"><code>--compress-level=NUM</code>, <code>--zl=NUM</code><a href="#opt--compress-level" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Explicitly set the compression level to use (see <a href="#opt--compress"><code>--compress</code></a>,
<code>-z</code>) instead of letting it default.  The <a href="#opt--compress"><code>--compress</code></a> option is
implied as long as the level chosen is not a &quot;don't compress&quot; level for the
compression algorithm that is in effect (e.g. zlib compression treats level
0 as &quot;off&quot;).</p>
<p>The level values vary depending on the checksum in effect.  Because rsync
will negotiate a checksum choice by default (when the remote rsync is new
enough), it can be good to combine this option with a
<a href="#opt--compress-choice"><code>--compress-choice</code></a> (<code>--zc</code>) option unless you're sure of the
choice in effect.  For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -aiv --zc=zstd --zl=22 host:src/ dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>For zlib &amp; zlibx compression the valid values are from 1 to 9 with 6 being
the default.  Specifying <code>--zl=0</code> turns compression off, and specifying
<code>--zl=-1</code> chooses the default level of 6.</p>
<p>For zstd compression the valid values are from -&#8288;131072 to 22 with 3 being
the default. Specifying 0 chooses the default of 3.</p>
<p>For lz4 compression there are no levels, so the value is always 0.</p>
<p>If you specify a too-large or too-small value, the number is silently
limited to a valid value.  This allows you to specify something like
<code>--zl=999999999</code> and be assured that you'll end up with the maximum
compression level no matter what algorithm was chosen.</p>
<p>If you want to know the compression level that is in effect, specify
<a href="#opt--debug"><code>--debug=nstr</code></a> to see the &quot;negotiated string&quot; results.  This will
report something like &quot;<code>Client compress: zstd (level 3)</code>&quot; (along with the
checksum choice in effect).</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--skip-compress"><code>--skip-compress=LIST</code><a href="#opt--skip-compress" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> no compression method currently supports per-file compression
changes, so this option has no effect.</p>
<p>Override the list of file suffixes that will be compressed as little as
possible.  Rsync sets the compression level on a per-file basis based on
the file's suffix.  If the compression algorithm has an &quot;off&quot; level, then
no compression occurs for those files.  Other algorithms that support
changing the streaming level on-the-fly will have the level minimized to
reduces the CPU usage as much as possible for a matching file.</p>
<p>The <strong>LIST</strong> should be one or more file suffixes (without the dot) separated
by slashes (<code>/</code>).  You may specify an empty string to indicate that no files
should be skipped.</p>
<p>Simple character-class matching is supported: each must consist of a list
of letters inside the square brackets (e.g. no special classes, such as
&quot;[:alpha:]&quot;, are supported, and '-&#8288;' has no special meaning).</p>
<p>The characters asterisk (<code>*</code>) and question-mark (<code>?</code>) have no special meaning.</p>
<p>Here's an example that specifies 6 suffixes to skip (since 1 of the 5 rules
matches 2 suffixes):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>--skip-compress=gz/jpg/mp[34]/7z/bz2
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The default file suffixes in the skip-compress list in this version of
rsync are:</p>

<p>This list will be replaced by your <code>--skip-compress</code> list in all but one
situation: a copy from a daemon rsync will add your skipped suffixes to its
list of non-compressing files (and its list may be configured to a
different default).</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--numeric-ids"><code>--numeric-ids</code><a href="#opt--numeric-ids" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>With this option rsync will transfer numeric group and user IDs rather than
using user and group names and mapping them at both ends.</p>
<p>By default rsync will use the username and groupname to determine what
ownership to give files.  The special uid 0 and the special group 0 are
never mapped via user/group names even if the <code>--numeric-ids</code> option is not
specified.</p>
<p>If a user or group has no name on the source system or it has no match on
the destination system, then the numeric ID from the source system is used
instead.  See also the <a href="rsyncd.conf.5#use_chroot"><code>use chroot</code></a> setting
in the rsyncd.conf manpage for some comments on how the chroot setting
affects rsync's ability to look up the names of the users and groups and
what you can do about it.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt--groupmap"></span><dt id="opt--usermap"><code>--usermap=STRING</code>, <code>--groupmap=STRING</code><a href="#opt--usermap" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>These options allow you to specify users and groups that should be mapped
to other values by the receiving side.  The <strong>STRING</strong> is one or more
<strong>FROM</strong>:<strong>TO</strong> pairs of values separated by commas.  Any matching <strong>FROM</strong>
value from the sender is replaced with a <strong>TO</strong> value from the receiver.
You may specify usernames or user IDs for the <strong>FROM</strong> and <strong>TO</strong> values,
and the <strong>FROM</strong> value may also be a wild-card string, which will be
matched against the sender's names (wild-cards do NOT match against ID
numbers, though see below for why a '<code>*</code>' matches everything).  You may
instead specify a range of ID numbers via an inclusive range: LOW-HIGH.
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>--usermap=0-99:nobody,wayne:admin,*:normal --groupmap=usr:1,1:usr
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The first match in the list is the one that is used.  You should specify
all your user mappings using a single <code>--usermap</code> option, and/or all your
group mappings using a single <code>--groupmap</code> option.</p>
<p>Note that the sender's name for the 0 user and group are not transmitted to
the receiver, so you should either match these values using a 0, or use the
names in effect on the receiving side (typically &quot;root&quot;).  All other
<strong>FROM</strong> names match those in use on the sending side.  All <strong>TO</strong> names
match those in use on the receiving side.</p>
<p>Any IDs that do not have a name on the sending side are treated as having
an empty name for the purpose of matching.  This allows them to be matched
via a &quot;<code>*</code>&quot; or using an empty name.  For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>--usermap=:nobody --groupmap=*:nobody
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>When the <a href="#opt--numeric-ids"><code>--numeric-ids</code></a> option is used, the sender does not send any
names, so all the IDs are treated as having an empty name.  This means that
you will need to specify numeric <strong>FROM</strong> values if you want to map these
nameless IDs to different values.</p>
<p>For the <code>--usermap</code> option to work, the receiver will need to be running as
a super-user (see also the <a href="#opt--super"><code>--super</code></a> and <a href="#opt--fake-super"><code>--fake-super</code></a>
options).  For the <code>--groupmap</code> option to work, the receiver will need to
have permissions to set that group.</p>
<p>Starting with rsync 3.2.4, the <code>--usermap</code> option implies the
<a href="#opt--owner"><code>--owner</code></a> (<code>-o</code>) option while the <code>--groupmap</code> option implies the
<a href="#opt--group"><code>--group</code></a> (<code>-g</code>) option (since rsync needs to have those options
enabled for the mapping options to work).</p>
<p>An older rsync client may need to use <a href="#opt-s"><code>-s</code></a> to avoid a complaint
about wildcard characters, but a modern rsync handles this automatically.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--chown"><code>--chown=USER:GROUP</code><a href="#opt--chown" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option forces all files to be owned by USER with group GROUP.  This is
a simpler interface than using <a href="#opt--usermap"><code>--usermap</code></a> &amp; <a href="#opt--groupmap"><code>--groupmap</code></a>
directly, but it is implemented using those options internally so they
cannot be mixed.  If either the USER or GROUP is empty, no mapping for the
omitted user/group will occur.  If GROUP is empty, the trailing colon may
be omitted, but if USER is empty, a leading colon must be supplied.</p>
<p>If you specify &quot;<code>--chown=foo:bar</code>&quot;, this is exactly the same as specifying
&quot;<code>--usermap=*:foo --groupmap=*:bar</code>&quot;, only easier (and with the same
implied <a href="#opt--owner"><code>--owner</code></a> and/or <a href="#opt--group"><code>--group</code></a> options).</p>
<p>An older rsync client may need to use <a href="#opt-s"><code>-s</code></a> to avoid a complaint
about wildcard characters, but a modern rsync handles this automatically.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--timeout"><code>--timeout=SECONDS</code><a href="#opt--timeout" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option allows you to set a maximum I/O timeout in seconds.  If no data
is transferred for the specified time then rsync will exit.  The default is
0, which means no timeout.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--contimeout"><code>--contimeout=SECONDS</code><a href="#opt--contimeout" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option allows you to set the amount of time that rsync will wait for
its connection to an rsync daemon to succeed.  If the timeout is reached,
rsync exits with an error.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--address"><code>--address=ADDRESS</code><a href="#opt--address" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>By default rsync will bind to the wildcard address when connecting to an
rsync daemon.  The <code>--address</code> option allows you to specify a specific IP
address (or hostname) to bind to.</p>
<p>See also <a href="#dopt--address">the daemon version of the <code>--address</code> option</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--port"><code>--port=PORT</code><a href="#opt--port" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This specifies an alternate TCP port number to use rather than the default
of 873.  This is only needed if you are using the double-colon (::) syntax
to connect with an rsync daemon (since the URL syntax has a way to specify
the port as a part of the URL).</p>
<p>See also <a href="#dopt--port">the daemon version of the <code>--port</code> option</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--sockopts"><code>--sockopts=OPTIONS</code><a href="#opt--sockopts" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option can provide endless fun for people who like to tune their
systems to the utmost degree.  You can set all sorts of socket options
which may make transfers faster (or slower!).  Read the manpage for the
<code>setsockopt()</code> system call for details on some of the options you may be
able to set.  By default no special socket options are set.  This only
affects direct socket connections to a remote rsync daemon.</p>
<p>See also <a href="#dopt--sockopts">the daemon version of the <code>--sockopts</code> option</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--blocking-io"><code>--blocking-io</code><a href="#opt--blocking-io" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to use blocking I/O when launching a remote shell
transport.  If the remote shell is either rsh or remsh, rsync defaults to
using blocking I/O, otherwise it defaults to using non-blocking I/O. (Note
that ssh prefers non-blocking I/O.)</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--outbuf"><code>--outbuf=MODE</code><a href="#opt--outbuf" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This sets the output buffering mode.  The mode can be None (aka
Unbuffered), Line, or Block (aka Full).  You may specify as little as a
single letter for the mode, and use upper or lower case.</p>
<p>The main use of this option is to change Full buffering to Line buffering
when rsync's output is going to a file or pipe.</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-i"></span><dt id="opt--itemize-changes"><code>--itemize-changes</code>, <code>-i</code><a href="#opt--itemize-changes" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Requests a simple itemized list of the changes that are being made to each
file, including attribute changes.  This is exactly the same as specifying
<a href="#opt--out-format"><code>--out-format='%i %n%L'</code></a>.  If you repeat the option, unchanged
files will also be output, but only if the receiving rsync is at least
version 2.6.7 (you can use <code>-vv</code> with older versions of rsync, but that
also turns on the output of other verbose messages).</p>
<p>The &quot;%i&quot; escape has a cryptic output that is 11 letters long.  The general
format is like the string <code>YXcstpoguax</code>, where <strong>Y</strong> is replaced by the type
of update being done, <strong>X</strong> is replaced by the file-type, and the other
letters represent attributes that may be output if they are being modified.</p>
<p>The update types that replace the <strong>Y</strong> are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>&lt;</code> means that a file is being transferred to the remote host (sent).</li>
<li>A <code>&gt;</code> means that a file is being transferred to the local host
(received).</li>
<li>A <code>c</code> means that a local change/creation is occurring for the item (such
as the creation of a directory or the changing of a symlink, etc.).</li>
<li>A <code>h</code> means that the item is a hard link to another item (requires
<a href="#opt--hard-links"><code>--hard-links</code></a>).</li>
<li>A <code>.</code> means that the item is not being updated (though it might have
attributes that are being modified).</li>
<li>A <code>*</code> means that the rest of the itemized-output area contains a message
(e.g. &quot;deleting&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>The file-types that replace the <strong>X</strong> are: <code>f</code> for a file, a <code>d</code> for a
directory, an <code>L</code> for a symlink, a <code>D</code> for a device, and a <code>S</code> for a
special file (e.g. named sockets and fifos).</p>
<p>The other letters in the string indicate if some attributes of the file
have changed, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;<code>.</code>&quot; -&#8288; the attribute is unchanged.</li>
<li>&quot;<code>+</code>&quot; -&#8288; the file is newly created.</li>
<li>&quot;<code> </code>&quot; -&#8288; all the attributes are unchanged (all dots turn to spaces).</li>
<li>&quot;<code>?</code>&quot; -&#8288; the change is unknown (when the remote rsync is old).</li>
<li>A letter indicates an attribute is being updated.</li>
</ul>
<p>The attribute that is associated with each letter is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>c</code> means either that a regular file has a different checksum (requires
<a href="#opt--checksum"><code>--checksum</code></a>) or that a symlink, device, or special file has a
changed value.  Note that if you are sending files to an rsync prior to
3.0.1, this change flag will be present only for checksum-differing
regular files.</li>
<li>A <code>s</code> means the size of a regular file is different and will be updated
by the file transfer.</li>
<li>A <code>t</code> means the modification time is different and is being updated to
the sender's value (requires <a href="#opt--times"><code>--times</code></a>).  An alternate value of
<code>T</code> means that the modification time will be set to the transfer time,
which happens when a file/symlink/device is updated without
<a href="#opt--times"><code>--times</code></a> and when a symlink is changed and the receiver can't
set its time. (Note: when using an rsync 3.0.0 client, you might see the
<code>s</code> flag combined with <code>t</code> instead of the proper <code>T</code> flag for this
time-setting failure.)</li>
<li>A <code>p</code> means the permissions are different and are being updated to the
sender's value (requires <a href="#opt--perms"><code>--perms</code></a>).</li>
<li>An <code>o</code> means the owner is different and is being updated to the sender's
value (requires <a href="#opt--owner"><code>--owner</code></a> and super-user privileges).</li>
<li>A <code>g</code> means the group is different and is being updated to the sender's
value (requires <a href="#opt--group"><code>--group</code></a> and the authority to set the group).</li>
<li>A <code>u</code>|<code>n</code>|<code>b</code> indicates the following information:
<ul>
<li><code>u</code>  means the access (use) time is different and is being updated to
the sender's value (requires <a href="#opt--atimes"><code>--atimes</code></a>)</li>
<li><code>n</code> means the create time (newness) is different and is being updated
to the sender's value (requires <a href="#opt--crtimes"><code>--crtimes</code></a>)</li>
<li><code>b</code> means that both the access and create times are being updated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>a</code> means that the ACL information is being changed.</li>
<li>The <code>x</code> means that the extended attribute information is being changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>One other output is possible: when deleting files, the &quot;%i&quot; will output the
string &quot;<code>*deleting</code>&quot; for each item that is being removed (assuming that you
are talking to a recent enough rsync that it logs deletions instead of
outputting them as a verbose message).</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--out-format"><code>--out-format=FORMAT</code><a href="#opt--out-format" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This allows you to specify exactly what the rsync client outputs to the
user on a per-update basis.  The format is a text string containing
embedded single-character escape sequences prefixed with a percent (%)
character.  A default format of &quot;%n%L&quot; is assumed if either
<a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=name</code></a> or <a href="#opt-v"><code>-v</code></a> is specified (this tells you just the
name of the file and, if the item is a link, where it points).  For a full
list of the possible escape characters, see the <a href="rsyncd.conf.5#log_format"><code>log format</code></a> setting in the rsyncd.conf manpage.</p>
<p>Specifying the <code>--out-format</code> option implies the <a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=name</code></a>
option, which will mention each file, dir, etc. that gets updated in a
significant way (a transferred file, a recreated symlink/device, or a
touched directory).  In addition, if the itemize-changes escape (%i) is
included in the string (e.g. if the <a href="#opt--itemize-changes"><code>--itemize-changes</code></a> option was
used), the logging of names increases to mention any item that is changed
in any way (as long as the receiving side is at least 2.6.4).  See the
<a href="#opt--itemize-changes"><code>--itemize-changes</code></a> option for a description of the output of &quot;%i&quot;.</p>
<p>Rsync will output the out-format string prior to a file's transfer unless
one of the transfer-statistic escapes is requested, in which case the
logging is done at the end of the file's transfer.  When this late logging
is in effect and <a href="#opt--progress"><code>--progress</code></a> is also specified, rsync will also
output the name of the file being transferred prior to its progress
information (followed, of course, by the out-format output).</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--log-file"><code>--log-file=FILE</code><a href="#opt--log-file" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option causes rsync to log what it is doing to a file.  This is
similar to the logging that a daemon does, but can be requested for the
client side and/or the server side of a non-daemon transfer.  If specified
as a client option, transfer logging will be enabled with a default format
of &quot;%i %n%L&quot;.  See the <a href="#opt--log-file-format"><code>--log-file-format</code></a> option if you wish to
override this.</p>
<p>Here's an example command that requests the remote side to log what is
happening:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av --remote-option=--log-file=/tmp/rlog src/ dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very useful if you need to debug why a connection is closing
unexpectedly.</p>
<p>See also <a href="#dopt--log-file">the daemon version of the <code>--log-file</code> option</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--log-file-format"><code>--log-file-format=FORMAT</code><a href="#opt--log-file-format" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This allows you to specify exactly what per-update logging is put into the
file specified by the <a href="#opt--log-file"><code>--log-file</code></a> option (which must also be
specified for this option to have any effect).  If you specify an empty
string, updated files will not be mentioned in the log file.  For a list of
the possible escape characters, see the <a href="rsyncd.conf.5#log_format"><code>log format</code></a>
setting in the rsyncd.conf manpage.</p>
<p>The default FORMAT used if <a href="#opt--log-file"><code>--log-file</code></a> is specified and this
option is not is '%i %n%L'.</p>
<p>See also <a href="#dopt--log-file-format">the daemon version of the <code>--log-file-format</code>
option</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--stats"><code>--stats</code><a href="#opt--stats" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to print a verbose set of statistics on the file transfer,
allowing you to tell how effective rsync's delta-transfer algorithm is for
your data.  This option is equivalent to <a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=stats2</code></a> if
combined with 0 or 1 <a href="#opt-v"><code>-v</code></a> options, or <a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=stats3</code></a> if
combined with 2 or more <a href="#opt-v"><code>-v</code></a> options.</p>
<p>The current statistics are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Number of files</code> is the count of all &quot;files&quot; (in the generic sense),
which includes directories, symlinks, etc.  The total count will be
followed by a list of counts by filetype (if the total is non-zero).  For
example: &quot;(reg: 5, dir: 3, link: 2, dev: 1, special: 1)&quot; lists the totals
for regular files, directories, symlinks, devices, and special files.  If
any of value is 0, it is completely omitted from the list.</li>
<li><code>Number of created files</code> is the count of how many &quot;files&quot; (generic
sense) were created (as opposed to updated).  The total count will be
followed by a list of counts by filetype (if the total is non-zero).</li>
<li><code>Number of deleted files</code> is the count of how many &quot;files&quot; (generic
sense) were deleted.  The total count will be
followed by a list of counts by filetype (if the total is non-zero).
Note that this line is only output if deletions are in effect, and only
if protocol 31 is being used (the default for rsync 3.1.x).</li>
<li><code>Number of regular files transferred</code> is the count of normal files that
were updated via rsync's delta-transfer algorithm, which does not include
dirs, symlinks, etc.  Note that rsync 3.1.0 added the word &quot;regular&quot; into
this heading.</li>
<li><code>Total file size</code> is the total sum of all file sizes in the transfer.
This does not count any size for directories or special files, but does
include the size of symlinks.</li>
<li><code>Total transferred file size</code> is the total sum of all files sizes for
just the transferred files.</li>
<li><code>Literal data</code> is how much unmatched file-update data we had to send to
the receiver for it to recreate the updated files.</li>
<li><code>Matched data</code> is how much data the receiver got locally when recreating
the updated files.</li>
<li><code>File list size</code> is how big the file-list data was when the sender sent
it to the receiver.  This is smaller than the in-memory size for the file
list due to some compressing of duplicated data when rsync sends the
list.</li>
<li><code>File list generation time</code> is the number of seconds that the sender
spent creating the file list.  This requires a modern rsync on the
sending side for this to be present.</li>
<li><code>File list transfer time</code> is the number of seconds that the sender spent
sending the file list to the receiver.</li>
<li><code>Total bytes sent</code> is the count of all the bytes that rsync sent from the
client side to the server side.</li>
<li><code>Total bytes received</code> is the count of all non-message bytes that rsync
received by the client side from the server side. &quot;Non-message&quot; bytes
means that we don't count the bytes for a verbose message that the server
sent to us, which makes the stats more consistent.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<span id="opt-8"></span><dt id="opt--8-bit-output"><code>--8-bit-output</code>, <code>-8</code><a href="#opt--8-bit-output" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync to leave all high-bit characters unescaped in the output
instead of trying to test them to see if they're valid in the current
locale and escaping the invalid ones.  All control characters (but never
tabs) are always escaped, regardless of this option's setting.</p>
<p>The escape idiom that started in 2.6.7 is to output a literal backslash
(<code>\</code>) and a hash (<code>#</code>), followed by exactly 3 octal digits.  For example, a
newline would output as &quot;<code>\#012</code>&quot;.  A literal backslash that is in a
filename is not escaped unless it is followed by a hash and 3 digits (0-9).</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-h"></span><dt id="opt--human-readable"><code>--human-readable</code>, <code>-h</code><a href="#opt--human-readable" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Output numbers in a more human-readable format.  There are 3 possible levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>output numbers with a separator between each set of 3 digits (either a
comma or a period, depending on if the decimal point is represented by a
period or a comma).</li>
<li>output numbers in units of 1000 (with a character suffix for larger
units&nbsp;-&#8288;-&#8288; see below).</li>
<li>output numbers in units of 1024.</li>
</ol>
<p>The default is human-readable level 1.  Each <code>-h</code> option increases the
level by one.  You can take the level down to 0 (to output numbers as pure
digits) by specifying the <code>--no-human-readable</code> (<code>--no-h</code>) option.</p>
<p>The unit letters that are appended in levels 2 and 3 are: <code>K</code> (kilo), <code>M</code>
(mega), <code>G</code> (giga), <code>T</code> (tera), or <code>P</code> (peta).  For example, a 1234567-byte
file would output as 1.23M in level-2 (assuming that a period is your local
decimal point).</p>
<p>Backward compatibility note: versions of rsync prior to 3.1.0 do not
support human-readable level 1, and they default to level 0.  Thus,
specifying one or two <code>-h</code> options will behave in a comparable manner in
old and new versions as long as you didn't specify a <code>--no-h</code> option prior
to one or more <code>-h</code> options.  See the <a href="#opt--list-only"><code>--list-only</code></a> option for one
difference.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--partial"><code>--partial</code><a href="#opt--partial" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>By default, rsync will delete any partially transferred file if the
transfer is interrupted.  In some circumstances it is more desirable to
keep partially transferred files.  Using the <code>--partial</code> option tells rsync
to keep the partial file which should make a subsequent transfer of the
rest of the file much faster.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--partial-dir"><code>--partial-dir=DIR</code><a href="#opt--partial-dir" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option modifies the behavior of the <a href="#opt--partial"><code>--partial</code></a> option while
also implying that it be enabled.  This enhanced partial-file method puts
any partially transferred files into the specified <u>DIR</u> instead of writing
the partial file out to the destination file.  On the next transfer, rsync
will use a file found in this dir as data to speed up the resumption of the
transfer and then delete it after it has served its purpose.</p>
<p>Note that if <a href="#opt--whole-file"><code>--whole-file</code></a> is specified (or implied), any
partial-dir files that are found for a file that is being updated will
simply be removed (since rsync is sending files without using rsync's
delta-transfer algorithm).</p>
<p>Rsync will create the <u>DIR</u> if it is missing, but just the last dir&nbsp;-&#8288;-&#8288; not
the whole path.  This makes it easy to use a relative path (such as
&quot;<code>--partial-dir=.rsync-partial</code>&quot;) to have rsync create the
partial-directory in the destination file's directory when it is needed,
and then remove it again when the partial file is deleted.  Note that this
directory removal is only done for a relative pathname, as it is expected
that an absolute path is to a directory that is reserved for partial-dir
work.</p>
<p>If the partial-dir value is not an absolute path, rsync will add an exclude
rule at the end of all your existing excludes.  This will prevent the
sending of any partial-dir files that may exist on the sending side, and
will also prevent the untimely deletion of partial-dir items on the
receiving side.  An example: the above <code>--partial-dir</code> option would add the
equivalent of this &quot;perishable&quot; exclude at the end of any other filter
rules: <code>-f '-p .rsync-partial/'</code></p>
<p>If you are supplying your own exclude rules, you may need to add your own
exclude/hide/protect rule for the partial-dir because:</p>
<ol>
<li>the auto-added rule may be ineffective at the end of your other rules, or</li>
<li>you may wish to override rsync's exclude choice.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, if you want to make rsync clean-up any left-over partial-dirs
that may be lying around, you should specify <a href="#opt--delete-after"><code>--delete-after</code></a> and
add a &quot;risk&quot; filter rule, e.g.  <code>-f 'R .rsync-partial/'</code>. Avoid using
<a href="#opt--delete-before"><code>--delete-before</code></a> or <a href="#opt--delete-during"><code>--delete-during</code></a> unless you don't
need rsync to use any of the left-over partial-dir data during the current
run.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: the <code>--partial-dir</code> should not be writable by other users or it
is a security risk!  E.g. AVOID &quot;/tmp&quot;!</p>
<p>You can also set the partial-dir value the <a href="#RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR"><code>RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR</code></a>
environment variable.  Setting this in the environment does not force
<a href="#opt--partial"><code>--partial</code></a> to be enabled, but rather it affects where partial
files go when <a href="#opt--partial"><code>--partial</code></a> is specified.  For instance, instead of
using <code>--partial-dir=.rsync-tmp</code> along with <a href="#opt--progress"><code>--progress</code></a>, you could
set <a href="#RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR"><code>RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR=.rsync-tmp</code></a> in your environment and then use
the <a href="#opt-P"><code>-P</code></a> option to turn on the use of the .rsync-tmp dir for
partial transfers.  The only times that the <a href="#opt--partial"><code>--partial</code></a> option does
not look for this environment value are:</p>
<ol>
<li>when <a href="#opt--inplace"><code>--inplace</code></a> was specified (since <a href="#opt--inplace"><code>--inplace</code></a>
conflicts with <code>--partial-dir</code>), and</li>
<li>when <a href="#opt--delay-updates"><code>--delay-updates</code></a> was specified (see below).</li>
</ol>
<p>When a modern rsync resumes the transfer of a file in the partial-dir, that
partial file is now updated in-place instead of creating yet another
tmp-file copy (so it maxes out at dest + tmp instead of dest + partial +
tmp).  This requires both ends of the transfer to be at least version
3.2.0.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the daemon-config's &quot;<code>refuse options</code>&quot; setting,
<code>--partial-dir</code> does <u>not</u> imply <a href="#opt--partial"><code>--partial</code></a>.  This is so that a
refusal of the <a href="#opt--partial"><code>--partial</code></a> option can be used to disallow the
overwriting of destination files with a partial transfer, while still
allowing the safer idiom provided by <code>--partial-dir</code>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--delay-updates"><code>--delay-updates</code><a href="#opt--delay-updates" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option puts the temporary file from each updated file into a holding
directory until the end of the transfer, at which time all the files are
renamed into place in rapid succession.  This attempts to make the updating
of the files a little more atomic.  By default the files are placed into a
directory named <code>.~tmp~</code> in each file's destination directory, but if
you've specified the <a href="#opt--partial-dir"><code>--partial-dir</code></a> option, that directory will be
used instead.  See the comments in the <a href="#opt--partial-dir"><code>--partial-dir</code></a> section for
a discussion of how this <code>.~tmp~</code> dir will be excluded from the transfer,
and what you can do if you want rsync to cleanup old <code>.~tmp~</code> dirs that
might be lying around.  Conflicts with <a href="#opt--inplace"><code>--inplace</code></a> and
<a href="#opt--append"><code>--append</code></a>.</p>
<p>This option implies <a href="#opt--no-inc-recursive"><code>--no-inc-recursive</code></a> since it needs the full
file list in memory in order to be able to iterate over it at the end.</p>
<p>This option uses more memory on the receiving side (one bit per file
transferred) and also requires enough free disk space on the receiving side
to hold an additional copy of all the updated files.  Note also that you
should not use an absolute path to <a href="#opt--partial-dir"><code>--partial-dir</code></a> unless:</p>
<ol>
<li>there is no chance of any of the files in the transfer having the same
name (since all the updated files will be put into a single directory if
the path is absolute), and</li>
<li>there are no mount points in the hierarchy (since the delayed updates
will fail if they can't be renamed into place).</li>
</ol>
<p>See also the &quot;atomic-rsync&quot; python script in the &quot;support&quot; subdir for an
update algorithm that is even more atomic (it uses <a href="#opt--link-dest"><code>--link-dest</code></a>
and a parallel hierarchy of files).</p>
</dd>

<span id="opt-m"></span><dt id="opt--prune-empty-dirs"><code>--prune-empty-dirs</code>, <code>-m</code><a href="#opt--prune-empty-dirs" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option tells the receiving rsync to get rid of empty directories from
the file-list, including nested directories that have no non-directory
children.  This is useful for avoiding the creation of a bunch of useless
directories when the sending rsync is recursively scanning a hierarchy of
files using include/exclude/filter rules.</p>
<p>This option can still leave empty directories on the receiving side if you
make use of <a href="#TRANSFER_RULES">TRANSFER_RULES</a>.</p>
<p>Because the file-list is actually being pruned, this option also affects
what directories get deleted when a delete is active.  However, keep in
mind that excluded files and directories can prevent existing items from
being deleted due to an exclude both hiding source files and protecting
destination files.  See the perishable filter-rule option for how to avoid
this.</p>
<p>You can prevent the pruning of certain empty directories from the file-list
by using a global &quot;protect&quot; filter.  For instance, this option would ensure
that the directory &quot;emptydir&quot; was kept in the file-list:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>--filter 'protect emptydir/'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's an example that copies all .pdf files in a hierarchy, only creating
the necessary destination directories to hold the .pdf files, and ensures
that any superfluous files and directories in the destination are removed
(note the hide filter of non-directories being used instead of an exclude):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -avm --del --include='*.pdf' -f 'hide,! */' src/ dest
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you didn't want to remove superfluous destination files, the more
time-honored options of <code>--include='*/' --exclude='*'</code> would work
fine in place of the hide-filter (if that is more natural to you).</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--progress"><code>--progress</code><a href="#opt--progress" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option tells rsync to print information showing the progress of the
transfer.  This gives a bored user something to watch.  With a modern rsync
this is the same as specifying <a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=flist2,name,progress</code></a>, but
any user-supplied settings for those info flags takes precedence (e.g.
<a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=flist0 --progress</code></a>).</p>
<p>While rsync is transferring a regular file, it updates a progress line that
looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>782448  63%  110.64kB/s    0:00:04
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, the receiver has reconstructed 782448 bytes or 63% of the
sender's file, which is being reconstructed at a rate of 110.64 kilobytes
per second, and the transfer will finish in 4 seconds if the current rate
is maintained until the end.</p>
<p>These statistics can be misleading if rsync's delta-transfer algorithm is
in use.  For example, if the sender's file consists of the basis file
followed by additional data, the reported rate will probably drop
dramatically when the receiver gets to the literal data, and the transfer
will probably take much longer to finish than the receiver estimated as it
was finishing the matched part of the file.</p>
<p>When the file transfer finishes, rsync replaces the progress line with a
summary line that looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>1,238,099 100%  146.38kB/s    0:00:08  (xfr#5, to-chk=169/396)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, the file was 1,238,099 bytes long in total, the average
rate of transfer for the whole file was 146.38 kilobytes per second over
the 8 seconds that it took to complete, it was the 5th transfer of a
regular file during the current rsync session, and there are 169 more files
for the receiver to check (to see if they are up-to-date or not) remaining
out of the 396 total files in the file-list.</p>
<p>In an incremental recursion scan, rsync won't know the total number of
files in the file-list until it reaches the ends of the scan, but since it
starts to transfer files during the scan, it will display a line with the
text &quot;ir-chk&quot; (for incremental recursion check) instead of &quot;to-chk&quot; until
the point that it knows the full size of the list, at which point it will
switch to using &quot;to-chk&quot;.  Thus, seeing &quot;ir-chk&quot; lets you know that the
total count of files in the file list is still going to increase (and each
time it does, the count of files left to check will increase by the number
of the files added to the list).</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt-P"><code>-P</code><a href="#opt-P" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>The <code>-P</code> option is equivalent to &quot;<a href="#opt--partial"><code>--partial</code></a>
<a href="#opt--progress"><code>--progress</code></a>&quot;.  Its purpose is to make it much easier to specify
these two options for a long transfer that may be interrupted.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=progress2</code></a> option that outputs statistics
based on the whole transfer, rather than individual files.  Use this flag
without outputting a filename (e.g. avoid <code>-v</code> or specify
<a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=name0</code></a>) if you want to see how the transfer is doing
without scrolling the screen with a lot of names. (You don't need to
specify the <a href="#opt--progress"><code>--progress</code></a> option in order to use
<a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=progress2</code></a>.)</p>
<p>Finally, you can get an instant progress report by sending rsync a signal
of either SIGINFO or SIGVTALRM.  On BSD systems, a SIGINFO is generated by
typing a Ctrl+T (Linux doesn't currently support a SIGINFO signal).  When
the client-side process receives one of those signals, it sets a flag to
output a single progress report which is output when the current file
transfer finishes (so it may take a little time if a big file is being
handled when the signal arrives).  A filename is output (if needed)
followed by the <a href="#opt--info"><code>--info=progress2</code></a> format of progress info.  If you
don't know which of the 3 rsync processes is the client process, it's OK to
signal all of them (since the non-client processes ignore the signal).</p>
<p>CAUTION: sending SIGVTALRM to an older rsync (pre-3.2.0) will kill it.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--password-file"><code>--password-file=FILE</code><a href="#opt--password-file" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option allows you to provide a password for accessing an rsync daemon
via a file or via standard input if <strong>FILE</strong> is <code>-</code>.  The file should
contain just the password on the first line (all other lines are ignored).
Rsync will exit with an error if <strong>FILE</strong> is world readable or if a
root-run rsync command finds a non-root-owned file.</p>
<p>This option does not supply a password to a remote shell transport such as
ssh; to learn how to do that, consult the remote shell's documentation.
When accessing an rsync daemon using a remote shell as the transport, this
option only comes into effect after the remote shell finishes its
authentication (i.e. if you have also specified a password in the daemon's
config file).</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--early-input"><code>--early-input=FILE</code><a href="#opt--early-input" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option allows rsync to send up to 5K of data to the &quot;early exec&quot;
script on its stdin.  One possible use of this data is to give the script a
secret that can be used to mount an encrypted filesystem (which you should
unmount in the the &quot;post-xfer exec&quot; script).</p>
<p>The daemon must be at least version 3.2.1.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--list-only"><code>--list-only</code><a href="#opt--list-only" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option will cause the source files to be listed instead of
transferred.  This option is inferred if there is a single source arg and
no destination specified, so its main uses are:</p>
<ol>
<li>to turn a copy command that includes a destination arg into a
file-listing command, or</li>
<li>to be able to specify more than one source arg.  Note: be sure to
include the destination.</li>
</ol>
<p>CAUTION: keep in mind that a source arg with a wild-card is expanded by the
shell into multiple args, so it is never safe to try to specify a single
wild-card arg to try to infer this option. A safe example is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av --list-only foo* dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This option always uses an output format that looks similar to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>drwxrwxr-x          4,096 2022/09/30 12:53:11 support
-rw-rw-r--             80 2005/01/11 10:37:37 support/Makefile
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The only option that affects this output style is (as of 3.1.0) the
<a href="#opt--human-readable"><code>--human-readable</code></a> (<code>-h</code>) option.  The default is to output sizes
as byte counts with digit separators (in a 14-character-width column).
Specifying at least one <code>-h</code> option makes the sizes output with unit
suffixes.  If you want old-style bytecount sizes without digit separators
(and an 11-character-width column) use <code>--no-h</code>.</p>
<p>Compatibility note: when requesting a remote listing of files from an rsync
that is version 2.6.3 or older, you may encounter an error if you ask for a
non-recursive listing.  This is because a file listing implies the
<a href="#opt--dirs"><code>--dirs</code></a> option w/o <a href="#opt--recursive"><code>--recursive</code></a>, and older rsyncs don't
have that option.  To avoid this problem, either specify the <code>--no-dirs</code>
option (if you don't need to expand a directory's content), or turn on
recursion and exclude the content of subdirectories: <code>-r --exclude='/*/*'</code>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--bwlimit"><code>--bwlimit=RATE</code><a href="#opt--bwlimit" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option allows you to specify the maximum transfer rate for the data
sent over the socket, specified in units per second.  The RATE value can be
suffixed with a string to indicate a size multiplier, and may be a
fractional value (e.g. <code>--bwlimit=1.5m</code>).  If no suffix is specified, the
value will be assumed to be in units of 1024 bytes (as if &quot;K&quot; or &quot;KiB&quot; had
been appended).  See the <a href="#opt--max-size"><code>--max-size</code></a> option for a description of
all the available suffixes.  A value of 0 specifies no limit.</p>
<p>For backward-compatibility reasons, the rate limit will be rounded to the
nearest KiB unit, so no rate smaller than 1024 bytes per second is
possible.</p>
<p>Rsync writes data over the socket in blocks, and this option both limits
the size of the blocks that rsync writes, and tries to keep the average
transfer rate at the requested limit.  Some burstiness may be seen where
rsync writes out a block of data and then sleeps to bring the average rate
into compliance.</p>
<p>Due to the internal buffering of data, the <a href="#opt--progress"><code>--progress</code></a> option may
not be an accurate reflection on how fast the data is being sent.  This is
because some files can show up as being rapidly sent when the data is
quickly buffered, while other can show up as very slow when the flushing of
the output buffer occurs.  This may be fixed in a future version.</p>
<p>See also <a href="#dopt--bwlimit">the daemon version of the <code>--bwlimit</code> option</a>.</p>

<span id="opt--time-limit"></span><dt id="opt--stop-after"><code>--stop-after=MINS</code>, (<code>--time-limit=MINS</code>)<a href="#opt--stop-after" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option tells rsync to stop copying when the specified number of
minutes has elapsed.</p>
<p>For maximal flexibility, rsync does not communicate this option to the
remote rsync since it is usually enough that one side of the connection
quits as specified.  This allows the option's use even when only one side
of the connection supports it.  You can tell the remote side about the time
limit using <a href="#opt--remote-option"><code>--remote-option</code></a> (<code>-M</code>), should the need arise.</p>
<p>The <code>--time-limit</code> version of this option is deprecated.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="opt--stop-at"><code>--stop-at=y-m-dTh:m</code><a href="#opt--stop-at" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option tells rsync to stop copying when the specified point in time
has been reached. The date &amp; time can be fully specified in a numeric
format of year-month-dayThour:minute (e.g. 2000-12-31T23:59) in the local
timezone.  You may choose to separate the date numbers using slashes
instead of dashes.</p>
<p>The value can also be abbreviated in a variety of ways, such as specifying
a 2-digit year and/or leaving off various values.  In all cases, the value
will be taken to be the next possible point in time where the supplied
information matches.  If the value specifies the current time or a past
time, rsync exits with an error.</p>
<p>For example, &quot;1-30&quot; specifies the next January 30th (at midnight local
time), &quot;14:00&quot; specifies the next 2 P.M., &quot;1&quot; specifies the next 1st of the
month at midnight, &quot;31&quot; specifies the next month where we can stop on its
31st day, and &quot;:59&quot; specifies the next 59th minute after the hour.</p>
<p>For maximal flexibility, rsync does not communicate this option to the
remote rsync since it is usually enough that one side of the connection
quits as specified.  This allows the option's use even when only one side
of the connection supports it.  You can tell the remote side about the time
limit using <a href="#opt--remote-option"><code>--remote-option</code></a> (<code>-M</code>), should the need arise.  Do
keep in mind that the remote host may have a different default timezone
than your local host.</p>

<dt id="opt--only-write-batch"><code>--only-write-batch=FILE</code><a href="#opt--only-write-batch" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Works like <a href="#opt--write-batch"><code>--write-batch</code></a>, except that no updates are made on the
destination system when creating the batch.  This lets you transport the
changes to the destination system via some other means and then apply the
changes via <a href="#opt--read-batch"><code>--read-batch</code></a>.</p>
<p>Note that you can feel free to write the batch directly to some portable
media: if this media fills to capacity before the end of the transfer, you
can just apply that partial transfer to the destination and repeat the
whole process to get the rest of the changes (as long as you don't mind a
partially updated destination system while the multi-update cycle is
happening).</p>
<p>Also note that you only save bandwidth when pushing changes to a remote
system because this allows the batched data to be diverted from the sender
into the batch file without having to flow over the wire to the receiver
(when pulling, the sender is remote, and thus can't write the batch).</p>

option, but rsync 2.6.3 is what will be used to run the
<a href="#opt--read-batch"><code>--read-batch</code></a> option, you should use &quot;-&#8288;-&#8288;protocol=28&quot; when creating
the batch file to force the older protocol version to be used in the batch

<dt id="opt--iconv"><code>--iconv=CONVERT_SPEC</code><a href="#opt--iconv" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Rsync can convert filenames between character sets using this option.
Using a CONVERT_SPEC of &quot;.&quot; tells rsync to look up the default
character-set via the locale setting.  Alternately, you can fully specify
what conversion to do by giving a local and a remote charset separated by a
comma in the order <code>--iconv=LOCAL,REMOTE</code>, e.g. <code>--iconv=utf8,iso88591</code>.
This order ensures that the option will stay the same whether you're
pushing or pulling files.  Finally, you can specify either <code>--no-iconv</code> or
a CONVERT_SPEC of &quot;-&#8288;&quot; to turn off any conversion.  The default setting of
this option is site-specific, and can also be affected via the
<a href="#RSYNC_ICONV"><code>RSYNC_ICONV</code></a> environment variable.</p>
<p>For a list of what charset names your local iconv library supports, you can
run &quot;<code>iconv --list</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>If you specify the <a href="#opt--secluded-args"><code>--secluded-args</code></a> (<code>-s</code>) option, rsync will
translate the filenames you specify on the command-line that are being sent
to the remote host.  See also the <a href="#opt--files-from"><code>--files-from</code></a> option.</p>
<p>Note that rsync does not do any conversion of names in filter files
(including include/exclude files).  It is up to you to ensure that you're
specifying matching rules that can match on both sides of the transfer.
For instance, you can specify extra include/exclude rules if there are
filename differences on the two sides that need to be accounted for.</p>
<p>When you pass an <code>--iconv</code> option to an rsync daemon that allows it, the
daemon uses the charset specified in its &quot;charset&quot; configuration parameter
regardless of the remote charset you actually pass.  Thus, you may feel
free to specify just the local charset for a daemon transfer (e.g.
<code>--iconv=utf8</code>).</p>

option is used to set a specific checksum seed, which is useful for
applications that want repeatable block checksums, or in the case where the
user wants a more random checksum seed.  Setting NUM to 0 causes rsync to

<h2 id="DAEMON_OPTIONS">DAEMON OPTIONS<a href="#DAEMON_OPTIONS" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>The options allowed when starting an rsync daemon are as follows:</p>
<dl>

<dt id="dopt--daemon"><code>--daemon</code><a href="#dopt--daemon" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This tells rsync that it is to run as a daemon.  The daemon you start
running may be accessed using an rsync client using the <code>host::module</code> or
<code>rsync://host/module/</code> syntax.</p>
<p>If standard input is a socket then rsync will assume that it is being run
via inetd, otherwise it will detach from the current terminal and become a
background daemon.  The daemon will read the config file (rsyncd.conf) on
each connect made by a client and respond to requests accordingly.</p>
<p>See the <a href="rsyncd.conf.5"><strong>rsyncd.conf</strong>(5)</a> manpage for more details.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="dopt--address"><code>--address=ADDRESS</code><a href="#dopt--address" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>By default rsync will bind to the wildcard address when run as a daemon
with the <code>--daemon</code> option.  The <code>--address</code> option allows you to specify a
specific IP address (or hostname) to bind to.  This makes virtual hosting
possible in conjunction with the <code>--config</code> option.</p>
<p>See also the <a href="rsyncd.conf.5#address">address</a> global option in the
rsyncd.conf manpage and the <a href="#opt--address">client version of the <code>--address</code>
option</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="dopt--bwlimit"><code>--bwlimit=RATE</code><a href="#dopt--bwlimit" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option allows you to specify the maximum transfer rate for the data
the daemon sends over the socket.  The client can still specify a smaller
<code>--bwlimit</code> value, but no larger value will be allowed.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#opt--bwlimit">client version of the <code>--bwlimit</code> option</a> for some
extra details.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="dopt--config"><code>--config=FILE</code><a href="#dopt--config" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This specifies an alternate config file than the default.  This is only
relevant when <a href="#dopt--daemon"><code>--daemon</code></a> is specified.  The default is
/etc/rsyncd.conf unless the daemon is running over a remote shell program
and the remote user is not the super-user; in that case the default is
rsyncd.conf in the current directory (typically $HOME).</p>
</dd>

<span id="dopt-M"></span><dt id="dopt--dparam"><code>--dparam=OVERRIDE</code>, <code>-M</code><a href="#dopt--dparam" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option can be used to set a daemon-config parameter when starting up
rsync in daemon mode.  It is equivalent to adding the parameter at the end
of the global settings prior to the first module's definition.  The
parameter names can be specified without spaces, if you so desire.  For
instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync --daemon -M pidfile=/path/rsync.pid
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>

<dt id="dopt--no-detach"><code>--no-detach</code><a href="#dopt--no-detach" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>When running as a daemon, this option instructs rsync to not detach itself
and become a background process.  This option is required when running as a
service on Cygwin, and may also be useful when rsync is supervised by a
program such as <code>daemontools</code> or AIX's <code>System Resource Controller</code>.
<code>--no-detach</code> is also recommended when rsync is run under a debugger.  This
option has no effect if rsync is run from inetd or sshd.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="dopt--port"><code>--port=PORT</code><a href="#dopt--port" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This specifies an alternate TCP port number for the daemon to listen on

<dt id="dopt--log-file-format"><code>--log-file-format=FORMAT</code><a href="#dopt--log-file-format" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This option tells the rsync daemon to use the given FORMAT string instead

&quot;<code>transfer logging</code>&quot; unless the string is empty, in which case transfer
logging is turned off.</p>

<h2 id="FILTER_RULES">FILTER RULES<a href="#FILTER_RULES" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>The filter rules allow for custom control of several aspects of how files are
handled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control which files the sending side puts into the file list that describes
the transfer hierarchy</li>
<li>Control which files the receiving side protects from deletion when the file
is not in the sender's file list</li>
<li>Control which extended attribute names are skipped when copying xattrs</li>
</ul>
<p>The rules are either directly specified via option arguments or they can be
read in from one or more files.  The filter-rule files can even be a part of
the hierarchy of files being copied, affecting different parts of the tree in
different ways.</p>
<h3 id="SIMPLE_INCLUDE_EXCLUDE_RULES">SIMPLE INCLUDE/EXCLUDE RULES<a href="#SIMPLE_INCLUDE_EXCLUDE_RULES" class="tgt"></a></h3>
<p>We will first cover the basics of how include &amp; exclude rules affect what files
are transferred, ignoring any deletion side-effects.  Filter rules mainly
affect the contents of directories that rsync is &quot;recursing&quot; into, but they can
also affect a top-level item in the transfer that was specified as a argument.</p>
<p>The default for any unmatched file/dir is for it to be included in the
transfer, which puts the file/dir into the sender's file list.  The use of an
exclude rule causes one or more matching files/dirs to be left out of the
sender's file list.  An include rule can be used to limit the effect of an
exclude rule that is matching too many files.</p>
<p>The order of the rules is important because the first rule that matches is the
one that takes effect.  Thus, if an early rule excludes a file, no include rule
that comes after it can have any effect. This means that you must place any
include overrides somewhere prior to the exclude that it is intended to limit.</p>
<p>When a directory is excluded, all its contents and sub-contents are also
excluded.  The sender doesn't scan through any of it at all, which can save a
lot of time when skipping large unneeded sub-trees.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand that the include/exclude rules are applied
to every file and directory that the sender is recursing into. Thus, if you
want a particular deep file to be included, you have to make sure that none of
the directories that must be traversed on the way down to that file are
excluded or else the file will never be discovered to be included. As an
example, if the directory &quot;<code>a/path</code>&quot; was given as a transfer argument and you
want to ensure that the file &quot;<code>a/path/down/deep/wanted.txt</code>&quot; is a part of the
transfer, then the sender must not exclude the directories &quot;<code>a/path</code>&quot;,
&quot;<code>a/path/down</code>&quot;, or &quot;<code>a/path/down/deep</code>&quot; as it makes it way scanning through
the file tree.</p>
<p>When you are working on the rules, it can be helpful to ask rsync to tell you
what is being excluded/included and why.  Specifying <code>--debug=FILTER</code> or (when
pulling files) <code>-M--debug=FILTER</code> turns on level 1 of the FILTER debug
information that will output a message any time that a file or directory is
included or excluded and which rule it matched.  Beginning in 3.2.4 it will
also warn if a filter rule has trailing whitespace, since an exclude of &quot;foo&nbsp;&quot;
(with a trailing space) will not exclude a file named &quot;foo&quot;.</p>
<p>Exclude and include rules can specify wildcard <a href="#PATTERN_MATCHING_RULES">PATTERN MATCHING RULES</a>
(similar to shell wildcards) that allow you to match things like a file suffix
or a portion of a filename.</p>
<p>A rule can be limited to only affecting a directory by putting a trailing slash
onto the filename.</p>
<h3 id="SIMPLE_INCLUDE_EXCLUDE_EXAMPLE">SIMPLE INCLUDE/EXCLUDE EXAMPLE<a href="#SIMPLE_INCLUDE_EXCLUDE_EXAMPLE" class="tgt"></a></h3>
<p>With the following file tree created on the sending side:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>mkdir x/
touch x/file.txt
mkdir x/y/
touch x/y/file.txt
touch x/y/zzz.txt
mkdir x/z/
touch x/z/file.txt
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the following rsync command will transfer the file &quot;<code>x/y/file.txt</code>&quot; and
the directories needed to hold it, resulting in the path &quot;<code>/tmp/x/y/file.txt</code>&quot;
existing on the remote host:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -ai -f'+ x/' -f'+ x/y/' -f'+ x/y/file.txt' -f'- *' x host:/tmp/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside: this copy could also have been accomplished using the <a href="#opt-R"><code>-R</code></a>
option (though the 2 commands behave differently if deletions are enabled):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -aiR x/y/file.txt host:/tmp/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The following command does not need an include of the &quot;x&quot; directory because it
is not a part of the transfer (note the traililng slash).  Running this command
would copy just &quot;<code>/tmp/x/file.txt</code>&quot; because the &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; dirs get excluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -ai -f'+ file.txt' -f'- *' x/ host:/tmp/x/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This command would omit the zzz.txt file while copying &quot;x&quot; and everything else
it contains:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -ai -f'- zzz.txt' x host:/tmp/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="FILTER_RULES_WHEN_DELETING">FILTER RULES WHEN DELETING<a href="#FILTER_RULES_WHEN_DELETING" class="tgt"></a></h3>
<p>By default the include &amp; exclude filter rules affect both the sender
(as it creates its file list)
and the receiver (as it creates its file lists for calculating deletions).  If
no delete option is in effect, the receiver skips creating the delete-related
file lists.  This two-sided default can be manually overridden so that you are
only specifying sender rules or receiver rules, as described in the <a href="#FILTER_RULES_IN_DEPTH">FILTER
RULES IN DEPTH</a> section.</p>
<p>When deleting, an exclude protects a file from being removed on the receiving
side while an include overrides that protection (putting the file at risk of
deletion). The default is for a file to be at risk&nbsp;-&#8288;-&#8288; its safety depends on it
matching a corresponding file from the sender.</p>
<p>An example of the two-sided exclude effect can be illustrated by the copying of
a C development directory between 2 systems.  When doing a touch-up copy, you
might want to skip copying the built executable and the <code>.o</code> files (sender
hide) so that the receiving side can build their own and not lose any object
files that are already correct (receiver protect).  For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -ai --del -f'- *.o' -f'- cmd' src host:/dest/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that using <code>-f'-p *.o'</code> is even better than <code>-f'- *.o'</code> if there is a
chance that the directory structure may have changed.  The &quot;p&quot; modifier is
discussed in <a href="#FILTER_RULE_MODIFIERS">FILTER RULE MODIFIERS</a>.</p>
<p>One final note, if your shell doesn't mind unexpanded wildcards, you could
simplify the typing of the filter options by using an underscore in place of
the space and leaving off the quotes.  For instance, <code>-f -_*.o -f -_cmd</code> (and
similar) could be used instead of the filter options above.</p>
<h3 id="FILTER_RULES_IN_DEPTH">FILTER RULES IN DEPTH<a href="#FILTER_RULES_IN_DEPTH" class="tgt"></a></h3>
<p>Rsync supports old-style include/exclude rules and new-style filter rules.  The
older rules are specified using <a href="#opt--include"><code>--include</code></a> and <a href="#opt--exclude"><code>--exclude</code></a> as
well as the <a href="#opt--include-from"><code>--include-from</code></a> and <a href="#opt--exclude-from"><code>--exclude-from</code></a>. These are
limited in behavior but they don't require a &quot;-&#8288;&quot; or &quot;+&quot; prefix.  An old-style
exclude rule is turned into a &quot;<code>- name</code>&quot; filter rule (with no modifiers) and an
old-style include rule is turned into a &quot;<code>+ name</code>&quot; filter rule (with no
modifiers).</p>
<p>Rsync builds an ordered list of filter rules as specified on the command-line
and/or read-in from files.  New style filter rules have the following syntax:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>RULE [PATTERN_OR_FILENAME]
RULE,MODIFIERS [PATTERN_OR_FILENAME]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You have your choice of using either short or long RULE names, as described
below.  If you use a short-named rule, the ',' separating the RULE from the
MODIFIERS is optional.  The PATTERN or FILENAME that follows (when present)
must come after either a single space or an underscore (_). Any additional
spaces and/or underscores are considered to be a part of the pattern name.
Here are the available rule prefixes:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>exclude, '-'</code></dt><dd> specifies an exclude pattern that (by default) is both a
<code>hide</code> and a <code>protect</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>include, '+'</code></dt><dd> specifies an include pattern that (by default) is both a
<code>show</code> and a <code>risk</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>merge, '.'</code></dt><dd> specifies a merge-file on the client side to read for more
rules.</dd>
<dt><code>dir-merge, ':'</code></dt><dd> specifies a per-directory merge-file.  Using this kind of
filter rule requires that you trust the sending side's filter checking, so
it has the side-effect mentioned under the <a href="#opt--trust-sender"><code>--trust-sender</code></a> option.</dd>
<dt><code>hide, 'H'</code></dt><dd> specifies a pattern for hiding files from the transfer.
Equivalent to a sender-only exclude, so <code>-f'H foo'</code> could also be specified
as <code>-f'-s foo'</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>show, 'S'</code></dt><dd> files that match the pattern are not hidden. Equivalent to a
sender-only include, so <code>-f'S foo'</code> could also be specified as <code>-f'+s foo'</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>protect, 'P'</code></dt><dd> specifies a pattern for protecting files from deletion.
Equivalent to a receiver-only exclude, so <code>-f'P foo'</code> could also be
specified as <code>-f'-r foo'</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>risk, 'R'</code></dt><dd> files that match the pattern are not protected. Equivalent to a
receiver-only include, so <code>-f'R foo'</code> could also be specified as <code>-f'+r foo'</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>clear, '!'</code></dt><dd> clears the current include/exclude list (takes no arg)</dd>
</dl>
<p>When rules are being read from a file (using merge or dir-merge), empty lines
are ignored, as are whole-line comments that start with a '<code>#</code>' (filename rules
that contain a hash character are unaffected).</p>
<p>Note also that the <a href="#opt--filter"><code>--filter</code></a>, <a href="#opt--include"><code>--include</code></a>, and
<a href="#opt--exclude"><code>--exclude</code></a> options take one rule/pattern each.  To add multiple ones,
you can repeat the options on the command-line, use the merge-file syntax of
the <a href="#opt--filter"><code>--filter</code></a> option, or the <a href="#opt--include-from"><code>--include-from</code></a> /
<a href="#opt--exclude-from"><code>--exclude-from</code></a> options.</p>
<h3 id="PATTERN_MATCHING_RULES">PATTERN MATCHING RULES<a href="#PATTERN_MATCHING_RULES" class="tgt"></a></h3>
<p>Most of the rules mentioned above take an argument that specifies what the rule
should match.  If rsync is recursing through a directory hierarchy, keep in
mind that each pattern is matched against the name of every directory in the
descent path as rsync finds the filenames to send.</p>
<p>The matching rules for the pattern argument take several forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a pattern contains a <code>/</code> (not counting a trailing slash) or a &quot;<code>**</code>&quot;
(which can match a slash), then the pattern is matched against the full
pathname, including any leading directories within the transfer.  If the
pattern doesn't contain a (non-trailing) <code>/</code> or a &quot;<code>**</code>&quot;, then it is matched
only against the final component of the filename or pathname. For example,
<code>foo</code> means that the final path component must be &quot;foo&quot; while <code>foo/bar</code> would
match the last 2 elements of the path (as long as both elements are within
the transfer).</li>
<li>A pattern that ends with a <code>/</code> only matches a directory, not a regular file,
symlink, or device.</li>
<li>A pattern that starts with a <code>/</code> is anchored to the start of the transfer
path instead of the end.  For example, <code>/foo/**</code> or <code>/foo/bar/**</code> match only
leading elements in the path.  If the rule is read from a per-directory
filter file, the transfer path being matched will begin at the level of the
filter file instead of the top of the transfer.  See the section on
<a href="#ANCHORING_INCLUDE_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS">ANCHORING INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERNS</a> for a full discussion of how to
specify a pattern that matches at the root of the transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rsync chooses between doing a simple string match and wildcard matching by
checking if the pattern contains one of these three wildcard characters: '<code>*</code>',
'<code>?</code>', and '<code>[</code>' :</p>
<ul>
<li>a '<code>?</code>' matches any single character except a slash (<code>/</code>).</li>
<li>a '<code>*</code>' matches zero or more non-slash characters.</li>
<li>a '<code>**</code>' matches zero or more characters, including slashes.</li>
<li>a '<code>[</code>' introduces a character class, such as <code>[a-z]</code> or <code>[[:alpha:]]</code>, that
must match one character.</li>
<li>a trailing <code>***</code> in the pattern is a shorthand that allows you to match a
directory and all its contents using a single rule.  For example, specifying
&quot;<code>dir_name/***</code>&quot; will match both the &quot;dir_name&quot; directory (as if &quot;<code>dir_name/</code>&quot;
had been specified) and everything in the directory (as if &quot;<code>dir_name/**</code>&quot;
had been specified).</li>
<li>a backslash can be used to escape a wildcard character, but it is only
interpreted as an escape character if at least one wildcard character is
present in the match pattern. For instance, the pattern &quot;<code>foo\bar</code>&quot; matches
that single backslash literally, while the pattern &quot;<code>foo\bar*</code>&quot; would need to
be changed to &quot;<code>foo\\bar*</code>&quot; to avoid the &quot;<code>\b</code>&quot; becoming just &quot;b&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples of exclude/include matching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option <code>-f'- *.o'</code> would exclude all filenames ending with <code>.o</code></li>
<li>Option <code>-f'- /foo'</code> would exclude a file (or directory) named foo in the
transfer-root directory</li>
<li>Option <code>-f'- foo/'</code> would exclude any directory named foo</li>
<li>Option <code>-f'- foo/*/bar'</code> would exclude any file/dir named bar which is at two
levels below a directory named foo (if foo is in the transfer)</li>
<li>Option <code>-f'- /foo/**/bar'</code> would exclude any file/dir named bar that was two
or more levels below a top-level directory named foo (note that /foo/bar is
<strong>not</strong> excluded by this)</li>
<li>Options <code>-f'+ */' -f'+ *.c' -f'- *'</code> would include all directories and .c
source files but nothing else</li>
<li>Options <code>-f'+ foo/' -f'+ foo/bar.c' -f'- *'</code> would include only the foo
directory and foo/bar.c (the foo directory must be explicitly included or it
would be excluded by the &quot;<code>- *</code>&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="FILTER_RULE_MODIFIERS">FILTER RULE MODIFIERS<a href="#FILTER_RULE_MODIFIERS" class="tgt"></a></h3>
<p>The following modifiers are accepted after an include (+) or exclude (-&#8288;) rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>/</code> specifies that the include/exclude rule should be matched against the
absolute pathname of the current item.  For example, <code>-f'-/ /etc/passwd'</code>
would exclude the passwd file any time the transfer was sending files from
the &quot;/etc&quot; directory, and &quot;-&#8288;/ subdir/foo&quot; would always exclude &quot;foo&quot; when it
is in a dir named &quot;subdir&quot;, even if &quot;foo&quot; is at the root of the current
transfer.</li>
<li>A <code>!</code> specifies that the include/exclude should take effect if the pattern
fails to match.  For instance, <code>-f'-! */'</code> would exclude all non-directories.</li>
<li>A <code>C</code> is used to indicate that all the global CVS-exclude rules should be
inserted as excludes in place of the &quot;-&#8288;C&quot;.  No arg should follow.</li>
<li>An <code>s</code> is used to indicate that the rule applies to the sending side.  When a
rule affects the sending side, it affects what files are put into the
sender's file list.  The default is for a rule to affect both sides unless
<a href="#opt--delete-excluded"><code>--delete-excluded</code></a> was specified, in which case default rules become
sender-side only.  See also the hide (H) and show (S) rules, which are an
alternate way to specify sending-side includes/excludes.</li>
<li>An <code>r</code> is used to indicate that the rule applies to the receiving side.  When
a rule affects the receiving side, it prevents files from being deleted.  See
the <code>s</code> modifier for more info.  See also the protect (P) and risk (R) rules,
which are an alternate way to specify receiver-side includes/excludes.</li>
<li>A <code>p</code> indicates that a rule is perishable, meaning that it is ignored in
directories that are being deleted.  For instance, the
<a href="#opt--cvs-exclude"><code>--cvs-exclude</code></a> (<code>-C</code>) option's default rules that exclude things
like &quot;CVS&quot; and &quot;<code>*.o</code>&quot; are marked as perishable, and will not prevent a
directory that was removed on the source from being deleted on the
destination.</li>
<li>An <code>x</code> indicates that a rule affects xattr names in xattr copy/delete
operations (and is thus ignored when matching file/dir names).  If no
xattr-matching rules are specified, a default xattr filtering rule is used
(see the <a href="#opt--xattrs"><code>--xattrs</code></a> option).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="MERGE-FILE_FILTER_RULES">MERGE-FILE FILTER RULES<a href="#MERGE-FILE_FILTER_RULES" class="tgt"></a></h3>
<p>You can merge whole files into your filter rules by specifying either a merge
(.) or a dir-merge (:) filter rule (as introduced in the <a href="#FILTER_RULES">FILTER RULES</a>
section above).</p>
<p>There are two kinds of merged files&nbsp;-&#8288;-&#8288; single-instance ('.') and per-directory
(':').  A single-instance merge file is read one time, and its rules are
incorporated into the filter list in the place of the &quot;.&quot; rule.  For
per-directory merge files, rsync will scan every directory that it traverses
for the named file, merging its contents when the file exists into the current
list of inherited rules.  These per-directory rule files must be created on the
sending side because it is the sending side that is being scanned for the
available files to transfer.  These rule files may also need to be transferred
to the receiving side if you want them to affect what files don't get deleted
(see <a href="#PER-DIRECTORY_RULES_AND_DELETE">PER-DIRECTORY RULES AND DELETE</a> below).</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>merge /etc/rsync/default.rules
. /etc/rsync/default.rules
dir-merge .per-dir-filter
dir-merge,n- .non-inherited-per-dir-excludes
:n- .non-inherited-per-dir-excludes
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The following modifiers are accepted after a merge or dir-merge rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>-</code> specifies that the file should consist of only exclude patterns, with
no other rule-parsing except for in-file comments.</li>
<li>A <code>+</code> specifies that the file should consist of only include patterns, with
no other rule-parsing except for in-file comments.</li>
<li>A <code>C</code> is a way to specify that the file should be read in a CVS-compatible
manner.  This turns on 'n', 'w', and '-&#8288;', but also allows the list-clearing
token (!) to be specified.  If no filename is provided, &quot;.cvsignore&quot; is
assumed.</li>
<li>A <code>e</code> will exclude the merge-file name from the transfer; e.g.  &quot;dir-merge,e
.rules&quot; is like &quot;dir-merge .rules&quot; and &quot;-&#8288; .rules&quot;.</li>
<li>An <code>n</code> specifies that the rules are not inherited by subdirectories.</li>
<li>A <code>w</code> specifies that the rules are word-split on whitespace instead of the
normal line-splitting.  This also turns off comments.  Note: the space that
separates the prefix from the rule is treated specially, so &quot;-&#8288; foo + bar&quot; is
parsed as two rules (assuming that prefix-parsing wasn't also disabled).</li>
<li>You may also specify any of the modifiers for the &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&#8288;&quot; rules (above) in
order to have the rules that are read in from the file default to having that
modifier set (except for the <code>!</code> modifier, which would not be useful).  For
instance, &quot;merge,-&#8288;/ .excl&quot; would treat the contents of .excl as absolute-path
excludes, while &quot;dir-merge,s .filt&quot; and &quot;:sC&quot; would each make all their
per-directory rules apply only on the sending side.  If the merge rule
specifies sides to affect (via the <code>s</code> or <code>r</code> modifier or both), then the
rules in the file must not specify sides (via a modifier or a rule prefix
such as <code>hide</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Per-directory rules are inherited in all subdirectories of the directory where
the merge-file was found unless the 'n' modifier was used.  Each subdirectory's
rules are prefixed to the inherited per-directory rules from its parents, which
gives the newest rules a higher priority than the inherited rules.  The entire
set of dir-merge rules are grouped together in the spot where the merge-file
was specified, so it is possible to override dir-merge rules via a rule that
got specified earlier in the list of global rules.  When the list-clearing rule
(&quot;!&quot;) is read from a per-directory file, it only clears the inherited rules for
the current merge file.</p>
<p>Another way to prevent a single rule from a dir-merge file from being inherited
is to anchor it with a leading slash.  Anchored rules in a per-directory
merge-file are relative to the merge-file's directory, so a pattern &quot;/foo&quot;
would only match the file &quot;foo&quot; in the directory where the dir-merge filter
file was found.</p>
<p>Here's an example filter file which you'd specify via <code>--filter=&quot;. file&quot;:</code></p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>merge /home/user/.global-filter
- *.gz
dir-merge .rules
+ *.[ch]
- *.o
- foo*
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will merge the contents of the /home/user/.global-filter file at the start
of the list and also turns the &quot;.rules&quot; filename into a per-directory filter
file.  All rules read in prior to the start of the directory scan follow the
global anchoring rules (i.e. a leading slash matches at the root of the
transfer).</p>
<p>If a per-directory merge-file is specified with a path that is a parent
directory of the first transfer directory, rsync will scan all the parent dirs
from that starting point to the transfer directory for the indicated
per-directory file.  For instance, here is a common filter (see <a href="#opt-F"><code>-F</code></a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>--filter=': /.rsync-filter'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>That rule tells rsync to scan for the file .rsync-filter in all directories
from the root down through the parent directory of the transfer prior to the
start of the normal directory scan of the file in the directories that are sent
as a part of the transfer. (Note: for an rsync daemon, the root is always the
same as the module's &quot;path&quot;.)</p>
<p>Some examples of this pre-scanning for per-directory files:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -avF /src/path/ /dest/dir
rsync -av --filter=': ../../.rsync-filter' /src/path/ /dest/dir
rsync -av --filter=': .rsync-filter' /src/path/ /dest/dir
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The first two commands above will look for &quot;.rsync-filter&quot; in &quot;/&quot; and &quot;/src&quot;
before the normal scan begins looking for the file in &quot;/src/path&quot; and its
subdirectories.  The last command avoids the parent-dir scan and only looks for
the &quot;.rsync-filter&quot; files in each directory that is a part of the transfer.</p>
<p>If you want to include the contents of a &quot;.cvsignore&quot; in your patterns, you
should use the rule &quot;:C&quot;, which creates a dir-merge of the .cvsignore file, but
parsed in a CVS-compatible manner.  You can use this to affect where the
<a href="#opt--cvs-exclude"><code>--cvs-exclude</code></a> (<code>-C</code>) option's inclusion of the per-directory
.cvsignore file gets placed into your rules by putting the &quot;:C&quot; wherever you
like in your filter rules.  Without this, rsync would add the dir-merge rule
for the .cvsignore file at the end of all your other rules (giving it a lower
priority than your command-line rules).  For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOT | rsync -avC --filter='. -' a/ b
+ foo.o
:C
- *.old
EOT
rsync -avC --include=foo.o -f :C --exclude='*.old' a/ b
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of the above rsync commands are identical.  Each one will merge all the
per-directory .cvsignore rules in the middle of the list rather than at the
end.  This allows their dir-specific rules to supersede the rules that follow
the :C instead of being subservient to all your rules.  To affect the other CVS
exclude rules (i.e. the default list of exclusions, the contents of
$HOME/.cvsignore, and the value of $CVSIGNORE) you should omit the <code>-C</code>
command-line option and instead insert a &quot;-&#8288;C&quot; rule into your filter rules; e.g.
&quot;<code>--filter=-C</code>&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="LIST-CLEARING_FILTER_RULE">LIST-CLEARING FILTER RULE<a href="#LIST-CLEARING_FILTER_RULE" class="tgt"></a></h3>
<p>You can clear the current include/exclude list by using the &quot;!&quot; filter rule (as
introduced in the <a href="#FILTER_RULES">FILTER RULES</a> section above).  The &quot;current&quot; list is either
the global list of rules (if the rule is encountered while parsing the filter
options) or a set of per-directory rules (which are inherited in their own
sub-list, so a subdirectory can use this to clear out the parent's rules).</p>
<h3 id="ANCHORING_INCLUDE_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS">ANCHORING INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERNS<a href="#ANCHORING_INCLUDE_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS" class="tgt"></a></h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, global include/exclude patterns are anchored at the &quot;root
of the transfer&quot; (as opposed to per-directory patterns, which are anchored at
the merge-file's directory).  If you think of the transfer as a subtree of
names that are being sent from sender to receiver, the transfer-root is where
the tree starts to be duplicated in the destination directory.  This root
governs where patterns that start with a / match.</p>
<p>Because the matching is relative to the transfer-root, changing the trailing
slash on a source path or changing your use of the <a href="#opt--relative"><code>--relative</code></a> option
affects the path you need to use in your matching (in addition to changing how
much of the file tree is duplicated on the destination host).  The following
examples demonstrate this.</p>
<p>Let's say that we want to match two source files, one with an absolute
path of &quot;/home/me/foo/bar&quot;, and one with a path of &quot;/home/you/bar/baz&quot;.
Here is how the various command choices differ for a 2-source transfer:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Example cmd: rsync -a /home/me /home/you /dest
+/- pattern: /me/foo/bar
+/- pattern: /you/bar/baz
Target file: /dest/me/foo/bar
Target file: /dest/you/bar/baz
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Example cmd: rsync -a /home/me/ /home/you/ /dest
+/- pattern: /foo/bar               (note missing &quot;me&quot;)
+/- pattern: /bar/baz               (note missing &quot;you&quot;)
Target file: /dest/foo/bar
Target file: /dest/bar/baz
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Example cmd: rsync -a --relative /home/me/ /home/you /dest
+/- pattern: /home/me/foo/bar       (note full path)
+/- pattern: /home/you/bar/baz      (ditto)
Target file: /dest/home/me/foo/bar
Target file: /dest/home/you/bar/baz
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Example cmd: cd /home; rsync -a --relative me/foo you/ /dest
+/- pattern: /me/foo/bar      (starts at specified path)
+/- pattern: /you/bar/baz     (ditto)
Target file: /dest/me/foo/bar
Target file: /dest/you/bar/baz
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The easiest way to see what name you should filter is to just look at the
output when using <a href="#opt--verbose"><code>--verbose</code></a> and put a / in front of the name (use the
<code>--dry-run</code> option if you're not yet ready to copy any files).</p>
<h3 id="PER-DIRECTORY_RULES_AND_DELETE">PER-DIRECTORY RULES AND DELETE<a href="#PER-DIRECTORY_RULES_AND_DELETE" class="tgt"></a></h3>
<p>Without a delete option, per-directory rules are only relevant on the sending
side, so you can feel free to exclude the merge files themselves without
affecting the transfer.  To make this easy, the 'e' modifier adds this exclude
for you, as seen in these two equivalent commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av --filter=': .excl' --exclude=.excl host:src/dir /dest
rsync -av --filter=':e .excl' host:src/dir /dest
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>However, if you want to do a delete on the receiving side AND you want some
files to be excluded from being deleted, you'll need to be sure that the
receiving side knows what files to exclude.  The easiest way is to include the
per-directory merge files in the transfer and use <a href="#opt--delete-after"><code>--delete-after</code></a>,
because this ensures that the receiving side gets all the same exclude rules as
the sending side before it tries to delete anything:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -avF --delete-after host:src/dir /dest
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>However, if the merge files are not a part of the transfer, you'll need to
either specify some global exclude rules (i.e. specified on the command line),
or you'll need to maintain your own per-directory merge files on the receiving
side.  An example of the first is this (assume that the remote .rules files
exclude themselves):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av --filter=': .rules' --filter='. /my/extra.rules'
   --delete host:src/dir /dest
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In the above example the extra.rules file can affect both sides of the
transfer, but (on the sending side) the rules are subservient to the rules
merged from the .rules files because they were specified after the
per-directory merge rule.</p>
<p>In one final example, the remote side is excluding the .rsync-filter files from
the transfer, but we want to use our own .rsync-filter files to control what
gets deleted on the receiving side.  To do this we must specifically exclude
the per-directory merge files (so that they don't get deleted) and then put
rules into the local files to control what else should not get deleted.  Like
one of these commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rsync -av --filter=':e /.rsync-filter' --delete \
    host:src/dir /dest
rsync -avFF --delete host:src/dir /dest
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="TRANSFER_RULES">TRANSFER RULES<a href="#TRANSFER_RULES" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#FILTER_RULES">FILTER RULES</a> that affect the recursive file scans that
generate the file list on the sending and (when deleting) receiving sides,
there are transfer rules. These rules affect which files the generator decides
need to be transferred without the side effects of an exclude filter rule.
Transfer rules affect only files and never directories.</p>
<p>Because a transfer rule does not affect what goes into the sender's (and
receiver's) file list, it cannot have any effect on which files get deleted on
the receiving side.  For example, if the file &quot;foo&quot; is present in the sender's
list but its size is such that it is omitted due to a transfer rule, the
receiving side does not request the file.  However, its presence in the file
list means that a delete pass will not remove a matching file named &quot;foo&quot; on
the receiving side.  On the other hand, a server-side exclude (hide) of the
file &quot;foo&quot; leaves the file out of the server's file list, and absent a
receiver-side exclude (protect) the receiver will remove a matching file named
&quot;foo&quot; if deletions are requested.</p>
<p>Given that the files are still in the sender's file list, the
<a href="#opt--prune-empty-dirs"><code>--prune-empty-dirs</code></a> option will not judge a directory as being empty
even if it contains only files that the transfer rules omitted.</p>
<p>Similarly, a transfer rule does not have any extra effect on which files are
deleted on the receiving side, so setting a maximum file size for the transfer
does not prevent big files from being deleted.</p>
<p>Examples of transfer rules include the default &quot;quick check&quot; algorithm (which
compares size &amp; modify time), the <a href="#opt--update"><code>--update</code></a> option, the
<a href="#opt--max-size"><code>--max-size</code></a> option, the <a href="#opt--ignore-non-existing"><code>--ignore-non-existing</code></a> option, and a
few others.</p>
<h2 id="BATCH_MODE">BATCH MODE<a href="#BATCH_MODE" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>Batch mode can be used to apply the same set of updates to many identical
systems.  Suppose one has a tree which is replicated on a number of hosts.  Now
suppose some changes have been made to this source tree and those changes need
to be propagated to the other hosts.  In order to do this using batch mode,
rsync is run with the write-batch option to apply the changes made to the
source tree to one of the destination trees.  The write-batch option causes the
rsync client to store in a &quot;batch file&quot; all the information needed to repeat
this operation against other, identical destination trees.</p>
<p>Generating the batch file once saves having to perform the file status,
checksum, and data block generation more than once when updating multiple
destination trees.  Multicast transport protocols can be used to transfer the
batch update files in parallel to many hosts at once, instead of sending the
same data to every host individually.</p>
<p>To apply the recorded changes to another destination tree, run rsync with the
read-batch option, specifying the name of the same batch file, and the
destination tree.  Rsync updates the destination tree using the information
stored in the batch file.</p>
<p>For your convenience, a script file is also created when the write-batch option
is used: it will be named the same as the batch file with &quot;.sh&quot; appended.  This
script file contains a command-line suitable for updating a destination tree
using the associated batch file.  It can be executed using a Bourne (or
Bourne-like) shell, optionally passing in an alternate destination tree
pathname which is then used instead of the original destination path.  This is
useful when the destination tree path on the current host differs from the one
used to create the batch file.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ rsync --write-batch=foo -a host:/source/dir/ /adest/dir/
$ scp foo* remote:
$ ssh remote ./foo.sh /bdest/dir/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ rsync --write-batch=foo -a /source/dir/ /adest/dir/
$ ssh remote rsync --read-batch=- -a /bdest/dir/ &lt;foo
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In these examples, rsync is used to update /adest/dir/ from /source/dir/ and
the information to repeat this operation is stored in &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;foo.sh&quot;.  The
host &quot;remote&quot; is then updated with the batched data going into the directory
/bdest/dir.  The differences between the two examples reveals some of the
flexibility you have in how you deal with batches:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first example shows that the initial copy doesn't have to be local&nbsp;-&#8288;-&#8288; you
can push or pull data to/from a remote host using either the remote-shell
syntax or rsync daemon syntax, as desired.</li>
<li>The first example uses the created &quot;foo.sh&quot; file to get the right rsync
options when running the read-batch command on the remote host.</li>
<li>The second example reads the batch data via standard input so that the batch
file doesn't need to be copied to the remote machine first.  This example
avoids the foo.sh script because it needed to use a modified
<a href="#opt--read-batch"><code>--read-batch</code></a> option, but you could edit the script file if you
wished to make use of it (just be sure that no other option is trying to use
standard input, such as the <a href="#opt--exclude-from"><code>--exclude-from=-</code></a> option).</li>
</ul>
<p>Caveats:</p>
<p>The read-batch option expects the destination tree that it is updating to be
identical to the destination tree that was used to create the batch update
fileset.  When a difference between the destination trees is encountered the
update might be discarded with a warning (if the file appears to be up-to-date
already) or the file-update may be attempted and then, if the file fails to
verify, the update discarded with an error.  This means that it should be safe
to re-run a read-batch operation if the command got interrupted.  If you wish
to force the batched-update to always be attempted regardless of the file's
size and date, use the <a href="#opt-I"><code>-I</code></a> option (when reading the batch).  If an
error occurs, the destination tree will probably be in a partially updated
state.  In that case, rsync can be used in its regular (non-batch) mode of
operation to fix up the destination tree.</p>
<p>The rsync version used on all destinations must be at least as new as the one
used to generate the batch file.  Rsync will die with an error if the protocol
version in the batch file is too new for the batch-reading rsync to handle.
See also the <a href="#opt--protocol"><code>--protocol</code></a> option for a way to have the creating rsync
generate a batch file that an older rsync can understand.  (Note that batch
files changed format in version 2.6.3, so mixing versions older than that with
newer versions will not work.)</p>
<p>When reading a batch file, rsync will force the value of certain options to
match the data in the batch file if you didn't set them to the same as the
batch-writing command.  Other options can (and should) be changed.  For
instance <a href="#opt--write-batch"><code>--write-batch</code></a> changes to <a href="#opt--read-batch"><code>--read-batch</code></a>,
<a href="#opt--files-from"><code>--files-from</code></a> is dropped, and the <a href="#opt--filter"><code>--filter</code></a> /
<a href="#opt--include"><code>--include</code></a> / <a href="#opt--exclude"><code>--exclude</code></a> options are not needed unless one of
the <a href="#opt--delete"><code>--delete</code></a> options is specified.</p>
<p>The code that creates the BATCH.sh file transforms any filter/include/exclude
options into a single list that is appended as a &quot;here&quot; document to the shell
script file.  An advanced user can use this to modify the exclude list if a
change in what gets deleted by <a href="#opt--delete"><code>--delete</code></a> is desired.  A normal user
can ignore this detail and just use the shell script as an easy way to run the
appropriate <a href="#opt--read-batch"><code>--read-batch</code></a> command for the batched data.</p>
<p>The original batch mode in rsync was based on &quot;rsync+&quot;, but the latest
version uses a new implementation.</p>
<h2 id="SYMBOLIC_LINKS">SYMBOLIC LINKS<a href="#SYMBOLIC_LINKS" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>Three basic behaviors are possible when rsync encounters a symbolic
link in the source directory.</p>
<p>By default, symbolic links are not transferred at all.  A message &quot;skipping
non-regular&quot; file is emitted for any symlinks that exist.</p>
<p>If <a href="#opt--links"><code>--links</code></a> is specified, then symlinks are added to the transfer
(instead of being noisily ignored), and the default handling is to recreate
them with the same target on the destination.  Note that <a href="#opt--archive"><code>--archive</code></a>
implies <a href="#opt--links"><code>--links</code></a>.</p>
<p>If <a href="#opt--copy-links"><code>--copy-links</code></a> is specified, then symlinks are &quot;collapsed&quot; by
copying their referent, rather than the symlink.</p>
<p>Rsync can also distinguish &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;unsafe&quot; symbolic links.  An example
where this might be used is a web site mirror that wishes to ensure that the
rsync module that is copied does not include symbolic links to <code>/etc/passwd</code> in
the public section of the site.  Using <a href="#opt--copy-unsafe-links"><code>--copy-unsafe-links</code></a> will cause
any links to be copied as the file they point to on the destination.  Using
<a href="#opt--safe-links"><code>--safe-links</code></a> will cause unsafe links to be omitted by the receiver.
(Note that you must specify or imply <a href="#opt--links"><code>--links</code></a> for
<a href="#opt--safe-links"><code>--safe-links</code></a> to have any effect.)</p>
<p>Symbolic links are considered unsafe if they are absolute symlinks (start with
<code>/</code>), empty, or if they contain enough &quot;..&quot; components to ascend from the top
of the transfer.</p>
<p>Here's a summary of how the symlink options are interpreted.  The list is in
order of precedence, so if your combination of options isn't mentioned, use the
first line that is a complete subset of your options:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>--copy-links</code></dt><dd> Turn all symlinks into normal files and directories
(leaving no symlinks in the transfer for any other options to affect).</dd>
<dt><code>--copy-dirlinks</code></dt><dd> Turn just symlinks to directories into real
directories, leaving all other symlinks to be handled as described below.</dd>
<dt><code>--links --copy-unsafe-links</code></dt><dd> Turn all unsafe symlinks
into files and create all safe symlinks.</dd>
<dt><code>--copy-unsafe-links</code></dt><dd> Turn all unsafe symlinks into files, noisily
skip all safe symlinks.</dd>
<dt><code>--links --safe-links</code></dt><dd> The receiver skips creating
unsafe symlinks found in the transfer and creates the safe ones.</dd>
<dt><code>--links</code></dt><dd> Create all symlinks.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For the effect of <a href="#opt--munge-links"><code>--munge-links</code></a>, see the discussion in that option's
section.</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="#opt--keep-dirlinks"><code>--keep-dirlinks</code></a> option does not effect symlinks in the
transfer but instead affects how rsync treats a symlink to a directory that
already exists on the receiving side.  See that option's section for a warning.</p>
<h2 id="DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS<a href="#DIAGNOSTICS" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>Rsync occasionally produces error messages that may seem a little cryptic.  The
one that seems to cause the most confusion is &quot;protocol version mismatch&nbsp;-&#8288;-&#8288; is
your shell clean?&quot;.</p>
<p>This message is usually caused by your startup scripts or remote shell facility
producing unwanted garbage on the stream that rsync is using for its transport.
The way to diagnose this problem is to run your remote shell like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>ssh remotehost /bin/true &gt; out.dat
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>then look at out.dat.  If everything is working correctly then out.dat should
be a zero length file.  If you are getting the above error from rsync then you
will probably find that out.dat contains some text or data.  Look at the
contents and try to work out what is producing it.  The most common cause is
incorrectly configured shell startup scripts (such as .cshrc or .profile) that
contain output statements for non-interactive logins.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble debugging filter patterns, then try specifying the
<code>-vv</code> option.  At this level of verbosity rsync will show why each individual
file is included or excluded.</p>

.cvsignore files.  See the <a href="#opt--cvs-exclude"><code>--cvs-exclude</code></a> option for more details.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="RSYNC_ICONV"><code>RSYNC_ICONV</code><a href="#RSYNC_ICONV" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Specify a default <a href="#opt--iconv"><code>--iconv</code></a> setting using this environment
variable. First supported in 3.0.0.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="RSYNC_OLD_ARGS"><code>RSYNC_OLD_ARGS</code><a href="#RSYNC_OLD_ARGS" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Specify a &quot;1&quot; if you want the <a href="#opt--old-args"><code>--old-args</code></a> option to be enabled by
default, a &quot;2&quot; (or more) if you want it to be enabled in the
repeated-option state, or a &quot;0&quot; to make sure that it is disabled by
default. When this environment variable is set to a non-zero value, it
supersedes the <a href="#RSYNC_PROTECT_ARGS"><code>RSYNC_PROTECT_ARGS</code></a> variable.</p>
<p>This variable is ignored if <a href="#opt--old-args"><code>--old-args</code></a>, <code>--no-old-args</code>, or
<a href="#opt--secluded-args"><code>--secluded-args</code></a> is specified on the command line.</p>
<p>First supported in 3.2.4.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="RSYNC_PROTECT_ARGS"><code>RSYNC_PROTECT_ARGS</code><a href="#RSYNC_PROTECT_ARGS" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>Specify a non-zero numeric value if you want the <a href="#opt--secluded-args"><code>--secluded-args</code></a>
option to be enabled by default, or a zero value to make sure that it is
disabled by default.</p>
<p>This variable is ignored if <a href="#opt--secluded-args"><code>--secluded-args</code></a>, <code>--no-secluded-args</code>,
or <a href="#opt--old-args"><code>--old-args</code></a> is specified on the command line.</p>
<p>First supported in 3.1.0.  Starting in 3.2.4, this variable is ignored if
<a href="#RSYNC_OLD_ARGS"><code>RSYNC_OLD_ARGS</code></a> is set to a non-zero value.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="RSYNC_RSH"><code>RSYNC_RSH</code><a href="#RSYNC_RSH" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This environment variable allows you to override the default shell used as
the transport for rsync.  Command line options are permitted after the
command name, just as in the <a href="#opt--rsh"><code>--rsh</code></a> (<code>-e</code>) option.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="RSYNC_PROXY"><code>RSYNC_PROXY</code><a href="#RSYNC_PROXY" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This environment variable allows you to redirect your rsync
client to use a web proxy when connecting to an rsync daemon.  You should
set <code>RSYNC_PROXY</code> to a hostname:port pair.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="RSYNC_PASSWORD"><code>RSYNC_PASSWORD</code><a href="#RSYNC_PASSWORD" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This environment variable allows you to set the password for an rsync
<strong>daemon</strong> connection, which avoids the password prompt.  Note that this
does <strong>not</strong> supply a password to a remote shell transport such as ssh
(consult its documentation for how to do that).</p>
</dd>

<span id="LOGNAME"></span><dt id="USER"><code>USER</code> or <code>LOGNAME</code><a href="#USER" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>The USER or LOGNAME environment variables are used to determine the default
username sent to an rsync daemon.  If neither is set, the username defaults
to &quot;nobody&quot;.  If both are set, <code>USER</code> takes precedence.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR"><code>RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR</code><a href="#RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This environment variable specifies the directory to use for a
<a href="#opt--partial"><code>--partial</code></a> transfer without implying that partial transfers be
enabled.  See the <a href="#opt--partial-dir"><code>--partial-dir</code></a> option for full details.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="RSYNC_COMPRESS_LIST"><code>RSYNC_COMPRESS_LIST</code><a href="#RSYNC_COMPRESS_LIST" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This environment variable allows you to customize the negotiation of the
compression algorithm by specifying an alternate order or a reduced list of
names.  Use the command <code>rsync --version</code> to see the available compression
names.  See the <a href="#opt--compress"><code>--compress</code></a> option for full details.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="RSYNC_CHECKSUM_LIST"><code>RSYNC_CHECKSUM_LIST</code><a href="#RSYNC_CHECKSUM_LIST" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This environment variable allows you to customize the negotiation of the
checksum algorithm by specifying an alternate order or a reduced list of
names.  Use the command <code>rsync --version</code> to see the available checksum
names.  See the <a href="#opt--checksum-choice"><code>--checksum-choice</code></a> option for full details.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="RSYNC_MAX_ALLOC"><code>RSYNC_MAX_ALLOC</code><a href="#RSYNC_MAX_ALLOC" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This environment variable sets an allocation maximum as if you had used the
<a href="#opt--max-alloc"><code>--max-alloc</code></a> option.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="RSYNC_PORT"><code>RSYNC_PORT</code><a href="#RSYNC_PORT" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This environment variable is not read by rsync, but is instead set in
its sub-environment when rsync is running the remote shell in combination
with a daemon connection.  This allows a script such as
<a href="rsync-ssl.1"><code>rsync-ssl</code></a> to be able to know the port number that the user
specified on the command line.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="HOME"><code>HOME</code><a href="#HOME" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This environment variable is used to find the user's default .cvsignore
file.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG"><code>RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG</code><a href="#RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This environment variable is mainly used in debug setups to set the program
to use when making a daemon connection.  See <a href="#CONNECTING_TO_AN_RSYNC_DAEMON">CONNECTING TO AN RSYNC
DAEMON</a> for full details.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="RSYNC_SHELL"><code>RSYNC_SHELL</code><a href="#RSYNC_SHELL" class="tgt"></a></dt><dd>
<p>This environment variable is mainly used in debug setups to set the program
to use to run the program specified by <a href="#RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG"><code>RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG</code></a>.  See
<a href="#CONNECTING_TO_AN_RSYNC_DAEMON">CONNECTING TO AN RSYNC DAEMON</a> for full details.</p>

<p>This manpage is current for version 3.3.0 of rsync.</p>
<h2 id="INTERNAL_OPTIONS">INTERNAL OPTIONS<a href="#INTERNAL_OPTIONS" class="tgt"></a></h2>
<p>The options <code>--server</code> and <code>--sender</code> are used internally by rsync, and should
never be typed by a user under normal circumstances.  Some awareness of these
options may be needed in certain scenarios, such as when setting up a login
that can only run an rsync command.  For instance, the support directory of the
rsync distribution has an example script named rrsync (for restricted rsync)
that can be used with a restricted ssh login.</p>
