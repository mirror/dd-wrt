    <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy 3.0.34</span> fixes a few minor bugs and comes with a couple of general
    improvements and new features.</p>
    <p>Changes in <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy 3.0.34</span> stable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Bug fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Improve the handling of chunk-encoded responses by buffering the data even if filters are disabled and
            properly keeping track of where the various chunks are supposed to start and end. Previously Privoxy would
            merely check the last bytes received to see if they looked like the last-chunk. This failed to work if the
            last-chunk wasn't received in one read and could also result in actual data being misdetected as
            last-chunk. Should fix: SF support request #1739. Reported by: withoutname.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>remove_chunked_transfer_coding(): Refuse to de-chunk invalid data Previously the data could get
            corrupted even further. Now we simply pass the unmodified data to the client.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>gif_deanimate(): Tolerate multiple image extensions in a row. This allows to deanimate all the gifs on:
            https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Animated_smilies Fixes SF bug #795 reported by Celejar.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>OpenSSL generate_host_certificate(): Use X509_get_subject_name() instead of X509_get_issuer_name() to
            get the issuer for generated website certificates so there are no warnings in the browser when using an
            intermediate CA certificate instead of a self-signed root certificate. Problem reported and patch submitted
            by Chakib Benziane.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>can_filter_request_body(): Fix a log message that contained a spurious u.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>handle_established_connection(): Check for pending TLS data from the client before checking if data is
            available on the connection. The TLS library may have already consumed all the data from the client
            response in which case poll() and select() will not detect that data is available to be read. Sponsored by:
            Robert Klemme.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>ssl_send_certificate_error(): Don't crash if there's no certificate information available. This is only
            relevant when Privoxy is built with wolfSSL 5.0.0 or later (code not yet published). Earlier wolfSSL
            versions or the other TLS backends don't seem to trigger the crash.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>socks5_connect(): Add support for target hosts specified as IPv4 address Previously the IP address was
            sent as domain.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>General improvements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Add a client-body-tagger action which creates tags based on the content of the request body. Sponsored
            by: Robert Klemme.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When client-body filters are enabled, buffer the whole request before opening a connection to the
            server. Makes it less likely that the server connection times out and we don't open a connection if the
            buffering fails anyway. Sponsored by: Robert Klemme.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add periods to a couple of log messages.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>accept_connection(): Add missing space to a log message.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Initialize ca-related defaults with strdup_or_die() so errors aren't silently ignored.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>make_path: Use malloc_or_die() in cases where allocation errors were already fatal anyway.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>handle_established_connection(): Improve an error message slightly.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>receive_client_request(): Reject https URLs without CONNECT request.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Include all requests in the statistics if mutexes are available. Previously in case of reused
            connections only the last request got counted. The statistics still aren't perfect but it's an
            improvement.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add read_socks_reply() and start using it in socks5_connect() to apply the socket timeout more
            consistently.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>socks5_connect(): Deal with domain names in the socks reply</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add a filter for bundeswehr.de that hides the cookie and privacy info banner.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Action file improvements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Disable filter{banners-by-size} for .freiheitsfoo.de/.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Disable filter{banners-by-size} for freebsdfoundation.org/.</p>

            <p>Block requests for elsa.memoinsights.com/t.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Fix a typo in a test.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Disable fast-redirects for launchpad.net/.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Unblock .eff.org/.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Stop unblocking .org/.*(image|banner) which appears to be too generous The example URL
            http://www.gnu.org/graphics/gnu-head-banner.png is already unblocked due to .gnu.org being unblocked.</p>
          </li>
          <li>

        <p>Privoxy-Log-Parser:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Bump version to 0.9.5.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Highlight the Crunch reason only once. Previously the "crunch reason" could also be highlighted when the
            URL contained a matching string. The real crunch reason only occurs once per line, so there's no need to
            continue looking for it after it has been found once. While at it, add a comment with an example log
            line.</p>

      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="UPGRADERSNOTE" id="UPGRADERSNOTE">3.1. Note to Upgraders</a></h2>
      <p>A quick list of things to be aware of before upgrading from earlier versions of <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The recommended way to upgrade <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is to backup your old
          configuration files, install the new ones, verify that <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is working
          correctly and finally merge back your changes using <span class="APPLICATION">diff</span> and maybe
          <span class="APPLICATION">patch</span>.</p>
          <p>There are a number of new features in each <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> release and most of
          them have to be explicitly enabled in the configuration files. Old configuration files obviously don't do
          that and due to syntax changes using old configuration files with a new <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> isn't always possible anyway.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Note that some installers remove earlier versions completely, including configuration files, therefore you
          should really save any important configuration files!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the other hand, other installers don't overwrite existing configuration files, thinking you will want
          to do that yourself.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the default configuration only fatal errors are logged now. You can change that in the <a href=
          "config.html#DEBUG">debug section</a> of the configuration file. You may also want to enable more verbose
          logging until you verified that the new <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> version is working as
          expected.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Three other config file settings are now off by default: <a href=
          "config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-TOGGLE">enable-remote-toggle</a>, <a href=
          "config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-HTTP-TOGGLE">enable-remote-http-toggle</a>, and <a href=
          "config.html#ENABLE-EDIT-ACTIONS">enable-edit-actions</a>. If you use or want these, you will need to
          explicitly enable them, and be aware of the security issues involved.</p>
