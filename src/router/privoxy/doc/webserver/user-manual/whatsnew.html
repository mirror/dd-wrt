    Release</a></h1>

    <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy 3.0.22</span> stable is mainly a
    bug-fix release, it also has a couple of new features, though. Note that
    the first two entries in the ChangeLog below refer to security
    issues:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Bug fixes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Fixed a memory leak when rejecting client connections due to
            the socket limit being reached (CID 66382). This affected Privoxy
            3.0.21 when compiled with IPv6 support (on most platforms this is
            the default).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fixed an immediate-use-after-free bug (CID 66394) and two
            additional unconfirmed use-after-free complaints made by Coverity
            scan (CID 66391, CID 66376).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Actually show the FORCE_PREFIX value on the show-status
            page.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Properly deal with Keep-Alive headers with timeout= parameters
            If the timeout still can't be parsed, use the configured timeout
            instead of preventing the client from keeping the connection
            alive. Fixes #3615312/#870 reported by Bernard Guillot.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Not using any filter files no longer results in warning
            messages unless an action file is referencing header taggers or
            filters. Reported by Stefan Kurtz in #3614835.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fixed a bug that prevented Privoxy from reusing some reusable
            connections. Two bit masks with different purpose unintentionally
            shared the same bit.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>A couple of additional bugs were discovered by Coverity Scan.
            The fixes that are not expected to affect users are not
            explicitly mentioned here, for details please have a look at the
            CVS logs.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>General improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Introduced negative tag patterns NO-REQUEST-TAG and
            NO-RESPONSE-TAG. They apply if no matching tag is found after
            parsing client or server headers.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add support for external filters which allow to process the
            response body with a script or program written in any language
            the platform supports. External filters are enabled with
            +external-filter{} after they have been defined in one of the
            filter files with a header line starting with "EXTERNAL-FILTER:".
            External filter support is experimental, not compiled by default
            and known not to work on all platforms.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add support for the 'PATCH' method as defined in RFC5789.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Reject requests with unsupported Expect header values. Fixes a
            couple of Co-Advisor tests.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Normalize the HTTP-version in forwarded requests and
            responses. This is an explicit RFC 2616 MUST and RFC 7230
            mandates that intermediaries send their own HTTP-version in
            forwarded messages.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Server 'Keep-Alive' headers are no longer forwarded. From a
            user's point of view it doesn't really matter, but RFC 2616
            (obsolete) mandates that the header is removed and this fixes a
            Co-Advisor complaint.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Change declared template file encoding to UTF-8. The templates
            already used a subset of UTF-8 anyway and changing the
            declaration allows to properly display UTF-8 characters used in
            the action files. This change may require existing action files
            with ISO-8859-1 characters that aren't valid UTF-8 to be
            converted to UTF-8. Requested by Sam Chen in #582.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Do not pass rejected keep-alive timeouts to the server. It
            might not have caused any problems (we know of), but doing the
            right thing shouldn't hurt either.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let log_error() use its own buffer size #define to make
            changing the log buffer size slightly less inconvenient.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Turned single-threaded into a "proper" toggle directive with
            arguments.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>CGI templates no longer enforce new windows for some
            links.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Remove an undocumented workaround ('HOST' header removal) for
            an Apple iTunes bug that according to #729900 got fixed in
            2003.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Action file improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The pattern 'promotions.' is no longer being blocked. Reported
            by rakista in #3608540.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Disable fast-redirects for .microsofttranslator.com/.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Disable filter{banners-by-size} for
            .dgb-tagungszentren.de/.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add adn.speedtest.net as a site-specific unblocker. Support
            request #3612908.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Disable filter{banners-by-size} for creativecommons.org/.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Block requests to data.gosquared.com/. Reported by cbug in
            #3613653.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Unblock .conrad./newsletter/. Reported by David Bo in
            #3614238.</p>
          </li>

            <p>Unblock .bundestag.de/.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Unblock .rote-hilfe.de/.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Disable fast-redirects for .facebook.com/plugins/like.php.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Unblock Stackexchange popup URLs that aren't used to serve
            ads. Reported by David Wagner in #3615179.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Disable fast-redirects for creativecommons.org/.</p>

          </li>

            <p>Disable HTML filters if the response was tagged as JavaScript.
            Filtering JavaScript code with filters intended to deal with HTML
            is usually a waste of time and, more importantly, may break
            stuff.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Use a custom redirect{} for

          </li>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Disable banners-by-size for kggp.de/.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Decrease the chances that js-annoyances creates invalid

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Remove a stray '1' in the 'html-annoyances' filter.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Prevent img-reorder from messing up img tags with empty src
            attributes. Fixes #880 reported by Duncan.</p>
          </li>

      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Documentation improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Updated the 'Would you like to donate?' section.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Note that invalid forward-override{} parameter syntax isn't
            detected until the parameter is used.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add another +redirect{} example: a shortcut for illumos
            bugs.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Make it more obvious that many operating systems support log

          </li>

          <li>

            answer to be slightly less condescending. Anonymously suggested
            in #3615122.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Be more explicit about accept-intercepted-requests's lack of

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add an example for a host pattern that matches an IP

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Recommend forward-socks5t when using Tor. It seems to work
            fine and modifying the Tor configuration to profit from it hasn't
            been necessary for a while now.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add another redirect{} example to stress that redirect loops

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The usual spelling and grammar fixes. Parts of them were

            section.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Clarify that handle-as-empty-doc-returns-ok is still useful
            and will not be removed without replacement.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Note that security issues shouldn't be reported using the bug
            tracker.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Clarify what Privoxy does if both +block{} and +redirect{}
            apply.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Removed the obsolete bookmarklets section.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Build system improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Let --with-group properly deal with secondary groups. Patch
            submitted by Anatoly Arzhnikov in #3615187.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fix web-actions target.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add a web-faq target that only updates the FAQ on the
            webserver.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Remove already-commented-out non-portable DOSFILTER
            alternatives.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Remove the obsolete targets dok-put and dok-get.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add a sf-shell target.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="UPGRADERSNOTE" id="UPGRADERSNOTE">3.1. Note
      to Upgraders</a></h2>

      <p>A quick list of things to be aware of before upgrading from earlier
      versions of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The recommended way to upgrade <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is to backup your old configuration
          files, install the new ones, verify that <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is working correctly and finally merge
          back your changes using <span class="APPLICATION">diff</span> and
          maybe <span class="APPLICATION">patch</span>.</p>

          <p>There are a number of new features in each <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> release and most of them have to be
          explicitly enabled in the configuration files. Old configuration
          files obviously don't do that and due to syntax changes using old
          configuration files with a new <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> isn't always possible anyway.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Note that some installers remove earlier versions completely,
          including configuration files, therefore you should really save any
          important configuration files!</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>On the other hand, other installers don't overwrite existing
          configuration files, thinking you will want to do that
          yourself.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>In the default configuration only fatal errors are logged now.
          You can change that in the <a href="config.html#DEBUG">debug
          section</a> of the configuration file. You may also want to enable
          more verbose logging until you verified that the new <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> version is working as expected.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Three other config file settings are now off by default:
          <a href="config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-TOGGLE">enable-remote-toggle</a>,
          <a href=
          "config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-HTTP-TOGGLE">enable-remote-http-toggle</a>,
          and <a href=
          "config.html#ENABLE-EDIT-ACTIONS">enable-edit-actions</a>. If you
          use or want these, you will need to explicitly enable them, and be
          aware of the security issues involved.</p>
