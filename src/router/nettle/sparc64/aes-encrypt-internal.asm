C The only difference between this code and the sparc32 code is the
C frame offsets, and the magic BIAS when accessing the stack (which
C doesn't matter, since we don't access any data on the stack).


C Use the same AES macros as on sparc32.

C	Arguments
define(`ROUNDS',`%i0')
define(`KEYS',	`%i1')
define(`T',	`%i2')
define(`LENGTH',`%i3')
define(`DST',	`%i4')
define(`SRC',	`%i5')

C	AES state, two copies for unrolling

define(`W0',	`%l0')
define(`W1',	`%l1')
define(`W2',	`%l2')
define(`W3',	`%l3')

define(`X0',	`%l4')
define(`X1',	`%l5')
define(`X2',	`%l6')
define(`X3',	`%l7')

C	%o0-%03 are used for loop invariants T0-T3
define(`KEY',	`%o4')
define(`COUNT', `%o5')

C %g1, %g2, %g3 are TMP1, TMP2 and TMP3

C The sparc64 stack frame looks like
C
C %fp -   8: OS-dependent link field
C %fp -  16: OS-dependent link field
C %fp - 192: OS register save area (22*8 == 176 bytes)
