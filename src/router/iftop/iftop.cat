       iftop - display bandwidth usage on an interface by host


SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       iiffttoopp --hh | [--nnNNppbbBBPP] [--ii _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e] [--ff _f_i_l_t_e_r _c_o_d_e] [--FF _n_e_t/_m_a_s_k]


DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       iiffttoopp  listens to network traffic on a named _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e, or on the first
       interface it can find which looks like an external interface if none is
       specified,  and displays a table of current bandwidth usage by pairs of
       hosts.  iiffttoopp must be run with sufficient permissions  to  monitor  all
       network traffic on the _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e; see ppccaapp(3) for more information, but
       on most systems this means that it must be run as root.

       By default, iiffttoopp will look up the hostnames associated with  addresses
       it  finds in packets. This can cause substantial traffic of itself, and
       may result in a confusing display. You may wish to suppress display  of
       DNS  traffic by using filter code such as nnoott ppoorrtt ddoommaaiinn, or switch it
       off entirely, by using the --nn option or by pressing RR when the  program
       is running.

       By  default,  iiffttoopp counts all IP packets that pass through the filter,
       and the direction of the packet is determined according to  the  direc-
       tion the packet is moving across the interface.  Using the --FF option it
       is possible to get iiffttoopp to show packets entering and leaving  a  given
       network.  For example, iiffttoopp --FF 1100..00..00..00//225555..00..00..00 will analyse packets
       flowing in and out of the 10.* network.

       Some other filter ideas:

              Count web traffic only, unless it is being  directed  through  a
              local web cache.

              will only include packets flowing in to or out of the given net-
              work, and packet direction is determined relative to the network
              boundary, rather than to the interface.  You may specify _m_a_s_k as
              a  dotted  quad,  such  as /255.255.255.0, or as a single number
              specifying the number of bits set in the netmask, such as /24.

       --cc _c_o_n_f_i_g _f_i_l_e
              Specifies an alternate config file.   If  not  specified,  iftop
              will  use  ~~//..iiffttoopprrcc if it exists.  See below for a description
              of config files


DDIISSPPLLAAYY
       When running, iiffttoopp uses the whole screen to display network usage.  At
       the  top  of the display is a logarithmic scale for the bar graph which
       gives a visual indication of traffic.

       The main part of the display lists, for each pair of hosts, the rate at
       which  data  has been sent and received over the preceding 2, 10 and 40
       second intervals. The direction of data flow is indicated by arrows, <=
       and =>. For instance,

       foo.example.com  =>  bar.example.com      1Kb  500b   100b
                        <=                       2Mb    2Mb    2Mb

       shows,  on  the  first  line, traffic from ffoooo..eexxaammppllee..ccoomm to bbaarr..eexxaamm--
       ppllee..ccoomm; in the preceding 2 seconds, this averaged 1Kbit/s, around half
       that  amount over the preceding 10s, and a fifth of that over the whole
       of the last 40s. During each of those intervals, the data sent  in  the
       other  direction was about 2Mbit/s. On the actual display, part of each
       line is inverted to give a visual indication  of  the  10s  average  of
       traffic.  You might expect to see something like this where host ffoooo is
       making repeated HTTP requests to bbaarr, which is sending data back  which
       saturates a 2Mbit/s link.

       By  default,  the  pairs  of hosts responsible for the most traffic (10
       second average) are displayed at the top of the list.

       At the bottom of the display, various totals are shown, including  peak
       traffic over the last 40s, total traffic transferred (after filtering),
       and total transfer rates averaged over 2s, 10s and 40s.

       By pressing ss or dd while iiffttoopp is running, all traffic for each  source
       or  destination  will be aggregated together.  This is most useful when
       iiffttoopp is run in promiscuous mode, or is run on a gateway machine.


PPOORRTT DDIISSPPLLAAYY
       SS or DD toggle the display of source and destination ports respectively.
       pp will toggle port display on/off.

       tt  cycles  through the four line display modes; the default 2-line dis-
       play, with sent and received traffic on separate lines,  and  3  1-line
       displays, with sent, received, or total traffic shown.


DDIISSPPLLAAYY OORRDDEERR
       By  default,  the  display is ordered according to the 10s average (2nd
       column).  By pressing 11, 22 or 33 it is possible to sort by the 1st,  2nd
       or  3rd  column.    By  pressing  <<  or >> the display will be sorted by
       source or destination hostname respectively.


DDIISSPPLLAAYY FFIILLTTEERRIINNGG
       ll allows you to enter a POSIX extended regular expression that will  be
       used  to  filter hostnames shown in the display.  This is a good way to
       quickly limit what is shown on the display.  Note that this happens  at
       a  much later stage than filter code, and does not affect what is actu-
       ally captured.  Display filters DO NOT affect the totals at the  bottom
       of the screen.

       PP will pause the current display.

       oo  will freeze the current screen order.  This has the side effect that
       traffic between hosts not shown on the screen at the time will  not  be
       shown  at all, although it will be included in the totals at the bottom
       of the screen.


SSCCRROOLLLL DDIISSPPLLAAYY

       ff  allows  you  to edit the filter code whilst iftop running.  This can
       lead to some unexpected behaviour.


CCOONNFFIIGG FFIILLEE
       iftop can read its configuration from a config file.  If the --cc  option
       is  not  specified,  iftop  will attempt to read its configuration from
       ~~//..iiffttoopprrcc, if it exists.  Any  command  line  options  specified  will
       override settings in the config file.

       The config file consists of one configuration directive per line.  Each
       directive is a name value pair, for example:

       interface: eth0

       sets the network interface.  The following config directives  are  sup-
       ported:

QQUUIIRRKKSS ((aakkaa tthheeyy''rree ffeeaattuurreess,, nnoott bbuuggss))
       There are some circumstances in which iftop may not do what you expect.
       In most cases what it is doing is logical, and we believe it is correct
       behaviour, although I'm happy to hear reasoned arguments  for  alterna-
       tive behaviour.

       TToottaallss ddoonn''tt aadddd uupp

       There are several reasons why the totals may not appear to add up.  The
       most obvious is having a screen filter in effect,  or  screen  ordering
       frozen.   In  this case some captured information is not being shown to
       you, but is included in the totals.

       A more subtle explanation comes about when running in promiscuous  mode
       without  specifying  a --FF option.  In this case there is no easy way to
       assign the direction of traffic between two  third  parties.   For  the
       purposes  of  the main display this is done in an arbitrary fashion (by
       ordering of IP addresses), but for  the  sake  of  totals  all  traffic
       between other hosts is accounted as incoming, because that's what it is
       from the point of view of your interface.  The --FF option allows you  to
       specify  an  arbitrary  network  boundary,  and to show traffic flowing
       across it.

       PPeeaakk ttoottaallss ddoonn''tt aadddd uupp

       Again, this is a feature.  The peak sent and peak received didn't  nec-
       essarily  happen  at  the  same time.  The peak total is the maximum of
       sent plus received in each captured time division.

       Give it time.  Changing the filter code affects what is  captured  from
       the  time  that  you  entered it, but most of what is on the display is
       based on some fraction of the last  40s  window  of  capturing.   After
       changing the filter there may be entries on the display that are disal-
       lowed by the current filter for up to 40s.  DISPLAY FILTERING has imme-
       diate effect and does not affect what is captured.
