=head1 NAME

perlapi - autogenerated documentation for the perl public API

=head1 DESCRIPTION
X<Perl API> X<API> X<api>

This file contains the documentation of the perl public API generated by
F<embed.pl>, specifically a listing of functions, macros, flags, and variables
that may be used by extension writers.  L<At the end|/Undocumented functions>
is a list of functions which have yet to be documented.  The interfaces of
those are subject to change without notice.  Anything not listed here is
not part of the public API, and should not be used by extension writers at
all.  For these reasons, blindly using functions listed in proto.h is to be
avoided when writing extensions.

In Perl, unlike C, a string of characters may generally contain embedded
C<NUL> characters.  Sometimes in the documentation a Perl string is referred
to as a "buffer" to distinguish it from a C string, but sometimes they are
both just referred to as strings.

Note that all Perl API global variables must be referenced with the C<PL_>
prefix.  Again, those not listed here are not to be used by extension writers,
and can be changed or removed without notice; same with macros.
Some macros are provided for compatibility with the older,
unadorned names, but this support may be disabled in a future release.

Perl was originally written to handle US-ASCII only (that is characters
whose ordinal numbers are in the range 0 - 127).
And documentation and comments may still use the term ASCII, when
sometimes in fact the entire range from 0 - 255 is meant.

The non-ASCII characters below 256 can have various meanings, depending on
various things.  (See, most notably, L<perllocale>.)  But usually the whole
range can be referred to as ISO-8859-1.  Often, the term "Latin-1" (or
"Latin1") is used as an equivalent for ISO-8859-1.  But some people treat
"Latin1" as referring just to the characters in the range 128 through 255, or
somethimes from 160 through 255.
This documentation uses "Latin1" and "Latin-1" to refer to all 256 characters.

Note that Perl can be compiled and run under either ASCII or EBCDIC (See
L<perlebcdic>).  Most of the documentation (and even comments in the code)
ignore the EBCDIC possibility.  
For almost all purposes the differences are transparent.
As an example, under EBCDIC,
instead of UTF-8, UTF-EBCDIC is used to encode Unicode strings, and so
whenever this documentation refers to C<utf8>
(and variants of that name, including in function names),
it also (essentially transparently) means C<UTF-EBCDIC>.
But the ordinals of characters differ between ASCII, EBCDIC, and
the UTF- encodings, and a string encoded in UTF-EBCDIC may occupy a different
number of bytes than in UTF-8.

The listing below is alphabetical, case insensitive.


=head1 Array Manipulation Functions

=over 8

=item av_clear
X<av_clear>

Frees the all the elements of an array, leaving it empty.
The XS equivalent of C<@array = ()>.  See also L</av_undef>.

Note that it is possible that the actions of a destructor called directly
or indirectly by freeing an element of the array could cause the reference
count of the array itself to be reduced (e.g. by deleting an entry in the
symbol table). So it is a possibility that the AV could have been freed
(or even reallocated) on return from the call unless you hold a reference
to it.

	void	av_clear(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_create_and_push
X<av_create_and_push>


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


Push an SV onto the end of the array, creating the array if necessary.
A small internal helper function to remove a commonly duplicated idiom.

	void	av_create_and_push(AV **const avp,
		                   SV *const val)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_create_and_unshift_one
X<av_create_and_unshift_one>


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


Unshifts an SV onto the beginning of the array, creating the array if
necessary.
A small internal helper function to remove a commonly duplicated idiom.

	SV**	av_create_and_unshift_one(AV **const avp,
		                          SV *const val)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_delete
X<av_delete>

Deletes the element indexed by C<key> from the array, makes the element
mortal, and returns it.  If C<flags> equals C<G_DISCARD>, the element is
freed and NULL is returned. NULL is also returned if C<key> is out of
range.

Perl equivalent: S<C<splice(@myarray, $key, 1, undef)>> (with the
C<splice> in void context if C<G_DISCARD> is present).

	SV*	av_delete(AV *av, SSize_t key, I32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_exists
X<av_exists>

Returns true if the element indexed by C<key> has been initialized.

This relies on the fact that uninitialized array elements are set to
C<NULL>.

Perl equivalent: C<exists($myarray[$key])>.

	bool	av_exists(AV *av, SSize_t key)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_extend
X<av_extend>

Pre-extend an array.  The C<key> is the index to which the array should be
extended.

	void	av_extend(AV *av, SSize_t key)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_fetch
X<av_fetch>

Returns the SV at the specified index in the array.  The C<key> is the
index.  If lval is true, you are guaranteed to get a real SV back (in case
it wasn't real before), which you can then modify.  Check that the return
value is non-null before dereferencing it to a C<SV*>.

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for
more information on how to use this function on tied arrays. 

The rough perl equivalent is C<$myarray[$key]>.

	SV**	av_fetch(AV *av, SSize_t key, I32 lval)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item AvFILL
X<AvFILL>

Same as C<av_top_index()>.  Deprecated, use C<av_top_index()> instead.

	int	AvFILL(AV* av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.h

=item av_fill
X<av_fill>

Set the highest index in the array to the given number, equivalent to
Perl's S<C<$#array = $fill;>>.

The number of elements in the array will be S<C<fill + 1>> after
C<av_fill()> returns.  If the array was previously shorter, then the
additional elements appended are set to NULL.  If the array
was longer, then the excess elements are freed.  S<C<av_fill(av, -1)>> is
the same as C<av_clear(av)>.

	void	av_fill(AV *av, SSize_t fill)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_len
X<av_len>

Same as L</av_top_index>.  Note that, unlike what the name implies, it returns
the highest index in the array, so to get the size of the array you need to use
S<C<av_len(av) + 1>>.  This is unlike L</sv_len>, which returns what you would
expect.

	SSize_t	av_len(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_make
X<av_make>

Creates a new AV and populates it with a list of SVs.  The SVs are copied
into the array, so they may be freed after the call to C<av_make>.  The new AV
will have a reference count of 1.

Perl equivalent: C<my @new_array = ($scalar1, $scalar2, $scalar3...);>

	AV*	av_make(SSize_t size, SV **strp)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_pop
X<av_pop>

Removes one SV from the end of the array, reducing its size by one and
returning the SV (transferring control of one reference count) to the
caller.  Returns C<&PL_sv_undef> if the array is empty.

Perl equivalent: C<pop(@myarray);>

	SV*	av_pop(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_push
X<av_push>

Pushes an SV (transferring control of one reference count) onto the end of the
array.  The array will grow automatically to accommodate the addition.

Perl equivalent: C<push @myarray, $val;>.

	void	av_push(AV *av, SV *val)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_shift
X<av_shift>

Removes one SV from the start of the array, reducing its size by one and
returning the SV (transferring control of one reference count) to the
caller.  Returns C<&PL_sv_undef> if the array is empty.

Perl equivalent: C<shift(@myarray);>

	SV*	av_shift(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_store
X<av_store>

Stores an SV in an array.  The array index is specified as C<key>.  The
return value will be C<NULL> if the operation failed or if the value did not
need to be actually stored within the array (as in the case of tied
arrays).  Otherwise, it can be dereferenced
to get the C<SV*> that was stored
there (= C<val>)).

Note that the caller is responsible for suitably incrementing the reference
count of C<val> before the call, and decrementing it if the function
returned C<NULL>.

Approximate Perl equivalent: C<splice(@myarray, $key, 1, $val)>.

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for
more information on how to use this function on tied arrays.

	SV**	av_store(AV *av, SSize_t key, SV *val)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_tindex
X<av_tindex>

Same as C<av_top_index()>.

	int	av_tindex(AV* av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.h

=item av_top_index
X<av_top_index>

Returns the highest index in the array.  The number of elements in the
array is S<C<av_top_index(av) + 1>>.  Returns -1 if the array is empty.

The Perl equivalent for this is C<$#myarray>.

(A slightly shorter form is C<av_tindex>.)

	SSize_t	av_top_index(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_undef
X<av_undef>

Undefines the array. The XS equivalent of C<undef(@array)>.

As well as freeing all the elements of the array (like C<av_clear()>), this
also frees the memory used by the av to store its list of scalars.

See L</av_clear> for a note about the array possibly being invalid on
return.

	void	av_undef(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_unshift
X<av_unshift>

Unshift the given number of C<undef> values onto the beginning of the
array.  The array will grow automatically to accommodate the addition.

Perl equivalent: S<C<unshift @myarray, ((undef) x $num);>>

	void	av_unshift(AV *av, SSize_t num)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item get_av
X<get_av>

Returns the AV of the specified Perl global or package array with the given
name (so it won't work on lexical variables).  C<flags> are passed 
to C<gv_fetchpv>.  If C<GV_ADD> is set and the
Perl variable does not exist then it will be created.  If C<flags> is zero
and the variable does not exist then NULL is returned.

Perl equivalent: C<@{"$name"}>.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	AV*	get_av(const char *name, I32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file perl.c

=item newAV
X<newAV>

Creates a new AV.  The reference count is set to 1.

Perl equivalent: C<my @array;>.

	AV*	newAV()

=for hackers
Found in file av.h

=item sortsv
X<sortsv>

In-place sort an array of SV pointers with the given comparison routine.

Currently this always uses mergesort.  See C<L</sortsv_flags>> for a more
flexible routine.

	void	sortsv(SV** array, size_t num_elts,
		       SVCOMPARE_t cmp)

=head1 Callback Functions

=over 8

=item call_argv
X<call_argv>

Performs a callback to the specified named and package-scoped Perl subroutine 
with C<argv> (a C<NULL>-terminated array of strings) as arguments.  See
L<perlcall>.

Approximate Perl equivalent: C<&{"$sub_name"}(@$argv)>.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	call_argv(const char* sub_name, I32 flags,
		          char** argv)

=for hackers
Found in file perl.c

=item call_method
X<call_method>

Performs a callback to the specified Perl method.  The blessed object must
be on the stack.  See L<perlcall>.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	call_method(const char* methname, I32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file perl.c

=item call_pv
X<call_pv>

Performs a callback to the specified Perl sub.  See L<perlcall>.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	call_pv(const char* sub_name, I32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file perl.c

=item call_sv
X<call_sv>

Performs a callback to the Perl sub specified by the SV.

If neither the C<G_METHOD> nor C<G_METHOD_NAMED> flag is supplied, the
SV may be any of a CV, a GV, a reference to a CV, a reference to a GV
or C<SvPV(sv)> will be used as the name of the sub to call.

If the C<G_METHOD> flag is supplied, the SV may be a reference to a CV or
C<SvPV(sv)> will be used as the name of the method to call.

If the C<G_METHOD_NAMED> flag is supplied, C<SvPV(sv)> will be used as
the name of the method to call.

Some other values are treated specially for internal use and should
not be depended on.

See L<perlcall>.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	call_sv(SV* sv, volatile I32 flags)

=for hackers

=item ENTER
X<ENTER>

Opening bracket on a callback.  See C<L</LEAVE>> and L<perlcall>.

		ENTER;

=for hackers
Found in file scope.h

=item ENTER_with_name(name)
X<ENTER_with_name(name)>

Same as C<L</ENTER>>, but when debugging is enabled it also associates the
given literal string with the new scope.

		ENTER_with_name(name);

=for hackers
Found in file scope.h

=item eval_pv
X<eval_pv>

Tells Perl to C<eval> the given string in scalar context and return an SV* result.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	SV*	eval_pv(const char* p, I32 croak_on_error)

=for hackers
Found in file perl.c

=item eval_sv
X<eval_sv>

Tells Perl to C<eval> the string in the SV.  It supports the same flags
as C<call_sv>, with the obvious exception of C<G_EVAL>.  See L<perlcall>.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	eval_sv(SV* sv, I32 flags)

=for hackers

=item FREETMPS
X<FREETMPS>

Closing bracket for temporaries on a callback.  See C<L</SAVETMPS>> and
L<perlcall>.

		FREETMPS;

=for hackers

=item LEAVE
X<LEAVE>

Closing bracket on a callback.  See C<L</ENTER>> and L<perlcall>.

		LEAVE;

=for hackers
Found in file scope.h

=item LEAVE_with_name(name)
X<LEAVE_with_name(name)>

Same as C<L</LEAVE>>, but when debugging is enabled it first checks that the
scope has the given name. C<name> must be a literal string.

		LEAVE_with_name(name);

=head1 Character case changing

Perl uses "full" Unicode case mappings.  This means that converting a single
character to another case may result in a sequence of more than one character.
For example, the uppercase of C<E<223>> (LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S) is the two
character sequence C<SS>.  This presents some complications   The lowercase of
all characters in the range 0..255 is a single character, and thus
C<L</toLOWER_L1>> is furnished.  But, C<toUPPER_L1> can't exist, as it couldn't
return a valid result for all legal inputs.  Instead C<L</toUPPER_uvchr>> has
an API that does allow every possible legal result to be returned.)  Likewise
no other function that is crippled by not being able to give the correct
results for the full range of possible inputs has been implemented here.


=over 8

=item toFOLD
X<toFOLD>

Converts the specified character to foldcase.  If the input is anything but an
ASCII uppercase character, that input character itself is returned.  Variant
C<toFOLD_A> is equivalent.  (There is no equivalent C<to_FOLD_L1> for the full
Latin1 range, as the full generality of L</toFOLD_uvchr> is needed there.)

	U8	toFOLD(U8 ch)

=for hackers
Found in file handy.h

=item toFOLD_utf8
X<toFOLD_utf8>

This is like C<L</toFOLD_utf8_safe>>, but doesn't have the C<e>
parameter  The function therefore can't check if it is reading
beyond the end of the string.  Starting in Perl v5.30, it will take the C<e>
parameter, becoming a synonym for C<toFOLD_utf8_safe>.  At that time every
program that uses it will have to be changed to successfully compile.  In the
meantime, the first runtime call to C<toFOLD_utf8> from each call point in the
program will raise a deprecation warning, enabled by default.  You can convert
your program now to use C<toFOLD_utf8_safe>, and avoid the warnings, and get an
extra measure of protection, or you can wait until v5.30, when you'll be forced
to add the C<e> parameter.

	UV	toFOLD_utf8(U8* p, U8* s, STRLEN* lenp)

=for hackers
Found in file handy.h

=item toFOLD_utf8_safe
X<toFOLD_utf8_safe>

Converts the first UTF-8 encoded character in the sequence starting at C<p> and
extending no further than S<C<e - 1>> to its foldcase version, and
stores that in UTF-8 in C<s>, and its length in bytes in C<lenp>.  Note
that the buffer pointed to by C<s> needs to be at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1>
bytes since the foldcase version may be longer than the original character.

The first code point of the foldcased version is returned
(but note, as explained at L<the top of this section|/Character case
changing>, that there may be more).

The suffix C<_safe> in the function's name indicates that it will not attempt
to read beyond S<C<e - 1>>, provided that the constraint S<C<s E<lt> e>> is
true (this is asserted for in C<-DDEBUGGING> builds).  If the UTF-8 for the
input character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the
function may return the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, at the discretion of the
implementation, and subject to change in future releases.

=item toFOLD_uvchr
X<toFOLD_uvchr>

Converts the code point C<cp> to its foldcase version, and
stores that in UTF-8 in C<s>, and its length in bytes in C<lenp>.  The code
point is interpreted as native if less than 256; otherwise as Unicode.  Note
that the buffer pointed to by C<s> needs to be at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1>
bytes since the foldcase version may be longer than the original character.

The first code point of the foldcased version is returned

=item toLOWER
X<toLOWER>

	U8	toLOWER(U8 ch)

=for hackers
Found in file handy.h

=item toLOWER_L1
X<toLOWER_L1>

	U8	toLOWER_L1(U8 ch)

=for hackers

Converts the specified character to lowercase using the current locale's rules,
if possible; otherwise returns the input character itself.

	U8	toLOWER_LC(U8 ch)

=for hackers

=item toLOWER_utf8

=item toLOWER_utf8_safe
X<toLOWER_utf8_safe>

Converts the first UTF-8 encoded character in the sequence starting at C<p> and
extending no further than S<C<e - 1>> to its lowercase version, and
stores that in UTF-8 in C<s>, and its length in bytes in C<lenp>.  Note
that the buffer pointed to by C<s> needs to be at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1>
bytes since the lowercase version may be longer than the original character.

The first code point of the lowercased version is returned
(but note, as explained at L<the top of this section|/Character case

This is like C<L</toUPPER_utf8_safe>>, but doesn't have the C<e>
parameter  The function therefore can't check if it is reading
beyond the end of the string.  Starting in Perl v5.30, it will take the C<e>

program that uses it will have to be changed to successfully compile.  In the
meantime, the first runtime call to C<toUPPER_utf8> from each call point in the

your program now to use C<toUPPER_utf8_safe>, and avoid the warnings, and get an
extra measure of protection, or you can wait until v5.30, when you'll be forced
to add the C<e> parameter.

=item toUPPER_utf8_safe
X<toUPPER_utf8_safe>

Converts the first UTF-8 encoded character in the sequence starting at C<p> and
extending no further than S<C<e - 1>> to its uppercase version, and
stores that in UTF-8 in C<s>, and its length in bytes in C<lenp>.  Note
that the buffer pointed to by C<s> needs to be at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1>
bytes since the uppercase version may be longer than the original character.

The first code point of the uppercased version is returned
(but note, as explained at L<the top of this section|/Character case

The suffix C<_safe> in the function's name indicates that it will not attempt
to read beyond S<C<e - 1>>, provided that the constraint S<C<s E<lt> e>> is
true (this is asserted for in C<-DDEBUGGING> builds).  If the UTF-8 for the
input character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the
function may return the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, at the discretion of the
implementation, and subject to change in future releases.

=head1 Character classification

This section is about functions (really macros) that classify characters
into types, such as punctuation versus alphabetic, etc.  Most of these are
analogous to regular expression character classes.  (See
L<perlrecharclass/POSIX Character Classes>.)  There are several variants for
each class.  (Not all macros have all variants; each item below lists the
ones valid for it.)  None are affected by C<use bytes>, and only the ones
with C<LC> in the name are affected by the current locale.

The base function, e.g., C<isALPHA()>, takes an octet (either a C<char> or a
C<U8>) as input and returns a boolean as to whether or not the character
represented by that octet is (or on non-ASCII platforms, corresponds to) an
ASCII character in the named class based on platform, Unicode, and Perl rules.
If the input is a number that doesn't fit in an octet, FALSE is returned.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_A> (e.g., C<isALPHA_A()>) is identical to the base function
with no suffix C<"_A">.  This variant is used to emphasize by its name that
only ASCII-range characters can return TRUE.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_L1> imposes the Latin-1 (or EBCDIC equivalent) character set
onto the platform.  That is, the code points that are ASCII are unaffected,
since ASCII is a subset of Latin-1.  But the non-ASCII code points are treated
as if they are Latin-1 characters.  For example, C<isWORDCHAR_L1()> will return
true when called with the code point 0xDF, which is a word character in both
ASCII and EBCDIC (though it represents different characters in each).

Variant C<isI<FOO>_uvchr> is like the C<isI<FOO>_L1> variant, but accepts any UV code
point as input.  If the code point is larger than 255, Unicode rules are used
to determine if it is in the character class.  For example,
C<isWORDCHAR_uvchr(0x100)> returns TRUE, since 0x100 is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
WITH MACRON in Unicode, and is a word character.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_utf8_safe> is like C<isI<FOO>_uvchr>, but is used for UTF-8
encoded strings.  Each call classifies one character, even if the string
contains many.  This variant takes two parameters.  The first, C<p>, is a
pointer to the first byte of the character to be classified.  (Recall that it
may take more than one byte to represent a character in UTF-8 strings.)  The
second parameter, C<e>, points to anywhere in the string beyond the first
character, up to one byte past the end of the entire string.  The suffix
C<_safe> in the function's name indicates that it will not attempt to read
beyond S<C<e - 1>>, provided that the constraint S<C<s E<lt> e>> is true (this
is asserted for in C<-DDEBUGGING> builds).  If the UTF-8 for the input
character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the function may
return FALSE, at the discretion of the implementation, and subject to change in
future releases.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_utf8> is like C<isI<FOO>_utf8_safe>, but takes just a single
parameter, C<p>, which has the same meaning as the corresponding parameter does
in C<isI<FOO>_utf8_safe>.  The function therefore can't check if it is reading
beyond the end of the string.  Starting in Perl v5.30, it will take a second
parameter, becoming a synonym for C<isI<FOO>_utf8_safe>.  At that time every
program that uses it will have to be changed to successfully compile.  In the
meantime, the first runtime call to C<isI<FOO>_utf8> from each call point in the
program will raise a deprecation warning, enabled by default.  You can convert
your program now to use C<isI<FOO>_utf8_safe>, and avoid the warnings, and get an
extra measure of protection, or you can wait until v5.30, when you'll be forced
to add the C<e> parameter.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_LC> is like the C<isI<FOO>_A> and C<isI<FOO>_L1> variants, but the
result is based on the current locale, which is what C<LC> in the name stands
for.  If Perl can determine that the current locale is a UTF-8 locale, it uses
the published Unicode rules; otherwise, it uses the C library function that
gives the named classification.  For example, C<isDIGIT_LC()> when not in a
UTF-8 locale returns the result of calling C<isdigit()>.  FALSE is always
returned if the input won't fit into an octet.  On some platforms where the C
library function is known to be defective, Perl changes its result to follow
the POSIX standard's rules.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_LC_uvchr> is like C<isI<FOO>_LC>, but is defined on any UV.  It
returns the same as C<isI<FOO>_LC> for input code points less than 256, and
returns the hard-coded, not-affected-by-locale, Unicode results for larger ones.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8_safe> is like C<isI<FOO>_LC_uvchr>, but is used for UTF-8
encoded strings.  Each call classifies one character, even if the string
contains many.  This variant takes two parameters.  The first, C<p>, is a
pointer to the first byte of the character to be classified.  (Recall that it
may take more than one byte to represent a character in UTF-8 strings.) The
second parameter, C<e>, points to anywhere in the string beyond the first
character, up to one byte past the end of the entire string.  The suffix
C<_safe> in the function's name indicates that it will not attempt to read
beyond S<C<e - 1>>, provided that the constraint S<C<s E<lt> e>> is true (this
is asserted for in C<-DDEBUGGING> builds).  If the UTF-8 for the input
character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the function may
return FALSE, at the discretion of the implementation, and subject to change in
future releases.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8> is like C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8_safe>, but takes just a single
parameter, C<p>, which has the same meaning as the corresponding parameter does
in C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8_safe>.  The function therefore can't check if it is reading
beyond the end of the string.  Starting in Perl v5.30, it will take a second
parameter, becoming a synonym for C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8_safe>.  At that time every
program that uses it will have to be changed to successfully compile.  In the
meantime, the first runtime call to C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8> from each call point in
the program will raise a deprecation warning, enabled by default.  You can
convert your program now to use C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8_safe>, and avoid the warnings,
and get an extra measure of protection, or you can wait until v5.30, when
you'll be forced to add the C<e> parameter.

library routine C<isascii()>.  In these cases, the variants whose names contain
C<LC> are the same as the corresponding ones without.

Also note, that because all ASCII characters are UTF-8 invariant (meaning they
have the exact same representation (always a single byte) whether encoded in
UTF-8 or not), C<isASCII> will give the correct results when called with any
byte in any string encoded or not in UTF-8.  And similarly C<isASCII_utf8_safe>

Create and return a new interpreter by cloning the current one.

C<perl_clone> takes these flags as parameters:

C<CLONEf_COPY_STACKS> - is used to, well, copy the stacks also,
without it we only clone the data and zero the stacks,
with it we copy the stacks and the new perl interpreter is
ready to run at the exact same point as the previous one.
The pseudo-fork code uses C<COPY_STACKS> while the
threads->create doesn't.

C<CLONEf_KEEP_PTR_TABLE> -
C<perl_clone> keeps a ptr_table with the pointer of the old
variable as a key and the new variable as a value,
this allows it to check if something has been cloned and not
clone it again but rather just use the value and increase the
refcount.  If C<KEEP_PTR_TABLE> is not set then C<perl_clone> will kill
the ptr_table using the function
C<ptr_table_free(PL_ptr_table); PL_ptr_table = NULL;>,
reason to keep it around is if you want to dup some of your own
variable who are outside the graph perl scans, an example of this
code is in F<threads.xs> create.

C<CLONEf_CLONE_HOST> -
This is a win32 thing, it is ignored on unix, it tells perls
win32host code (which is c++) to clone itself, this is needed on
win32 if you want to run two threads at the same time,
if you just want to do some stuff in a separate perl interpreter
and then throw it away and return to the original one,
you don't need to do anything.

Stores a value, associated with a key, in the cop hints hash C<cophh>,

not the same as the hash pointer that was passed in.  The input hash is
consumed by the function, and the pointer to it must not be subsequently

The key is specified by C<keypv> and C<keylen>.  If C<flags> has the

otherwise they are interpreted as Latin-1.  C<hash> is a precomputed
hash of the key string, or zero if it has not been precomputed.

C<value> is the scalar value to store for this key.  C<value> is copied
by this function, which thus does not take ownership of any reference
to it, and later changes to the scalar will not be reflected in the
value visible in the cop hints hash.  Complex types of scalar will not
be stored with referential integrity, but will be coerced to strings.

information returned to Perl by C<caller>.  Note that XSUBs don't get a
stack frame, so C<caller_cx(0, NULL)> will return information for the
immediately-surrounding Perl code.

This function skips over the automatic calls to C<&DB::sub> made on the
behalf of the debugger.  If the stack frame requested was a sub called by
C<DB::sub>, the return value will be the frame for the call to
C<DB::sub>, since that has the correct line number/etc. for the call

X<pv_escape>

Escapes at most the first C<count> chars of C<pv> and puts the results into
C<dsv> such that the size of the escaped string will not exceed C<max> chars
and will not contain any incomplete escape sequences.  The number of bytes
escaped will be returned in the C<STRLEN *escaped> parameter if it is not null.
When the C<dsv> parameter is null no escaping actually occurs, but the number
of bytes that would be escaped were it not null will be calculated.

If flags contains C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_QUOTE> then any double quotes in the string
will also be escaped.

Normally the SV will be cleared before the escaped string is prepared,
but when C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NOCLEAR> is set this will not occur.

If C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_UNI> is set then the input string is treated as UTF-8
if C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_UNI_DETECT> is set then the input string is scanned
using C<is_utf8_string()> to determine if it is UTF-8.

If C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_ALL> is set then all input chars will be output
using C<\x01F1> style escapes, otherwise if C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NONASCII> is set, only
non-ASCII chars will be escaped using this style; otherwise, only chars above
255 will be so escaped; other non printable chars will use octal or
common escaped patterns like C<\n>.
Otherwise, if C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NOBACKSLASH>
then all chars below 255 will be treated as printable and
will be output as literals.

If C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_FIRSTCHAR> is set then only the first char of the
string will be escaped, regardless of max.  If the output is to be in hex,
then it will be returned as a plain hex
sequence.  Thus the output will either be a single char,
an octal escape sequence, a special escape like C<\n> or a hex value.

If C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_RE> is set then the escape char used will be a C<"%"> and
not a C<"\\">.  This is because regexes very often contain backslashed
sequences, whereas C<"%"> is not a particularly common character in patterns.

Returns a pointer to the escaped text as held by C<dsv>.

Converts a string into something presentable, handling escaping via

double quoted with any double quotes in the string escaped.  Otherwise
if the C<PERL_PV_PRETTY_LTGT> flag is set then the result be wrapped in
angle brackets. 

If the C<PERL_PV_PRETTY_ELLIPSES> flag is set and not all characters in
string were output then an ellipsis C<...> will be appended to the
string.  Note that this happens AFTER it has been quoted.

If C<start_color> is non-null then it will be inserted after the opening
quote (if there is one) but before the escaped text.  If C<end_color>
is non-null then it will be inserted after the escaped text but before
any quotes or ellipses.

Returns a pointer to the prettified text as held by C<dsv>.

=item load_module
X<load_module>

Loads the module whose name is pointed to by the string part of C<name>.
Note that the actual module name, not its filename, should be given.
Eg, "Foo::Bar" instead of "Foo/Bar.pm". ver, if specified and not NULL,
provides version semantics similar to C<use Foo::Bar VERSION>. The optional
trailing arguments can be used to specify arguments to the module's C<import()>
method, similar to C<use Foo::Bar VERSION LIST>; their precise handling depends
on the flags. The flags argument is a bitwise-ORed collection of any of
C<PERL_LOADMOD_DENY>, C<PERL_LOADMOD_NOIMPORT>, or C<PERL_LOADMOD_IMPORT_OPS>
(or 0 for no flags).

If C<PERL_LOADMOD_NOIMPORT> is set, the module is loaded as if with an empty
import list, as in C<use Foo::Bar ()>; this is the only circumstance in which
the trailing optional arguments may be omitted entirely. Otherwise, if
C<PERL_LOADMOD_IMPORT_OPS> is set, the trailing arguments must consist of
exactly one C<OP*>, containing the op tree that produces the relevant import
arguments. Otherwise, the trailing arguments must all be C<SV*> values that
will be used as import arguments; and the list must be terminated with C<(SV*)
NULL>. If neither C<PERL_LOADMOD_NOIMPORT> nor C<PERL_LOADMOD_IMPORT_OPS> is
set, the trailing C<NULL> pointer is needed even if no import arguments are
desired. The reference count for each specified C<SV*> argument is
decremented. In addition, the C<name> argument is modified.

If C<PERL_LOADMOD_DENY> is set, the module is loaded as if with C<no> rather
than C<use>.

Allocates a place in the currently-compiling pad,

C<tmptype> is a set of flags indicating the kind of pad entry required,

C<SVf_READONLY> has been supported here only since perl 5.20.  To work with
earlier versions as well, use C<SVf_READONLY|SVs_PADTMP>.  C<SVf_READONLY>
does not cause the SV in the pad slot to be marked read-only, but simply
tells C<pad_alloc> that it I<will> be made read-only (by the caller), or at

=item perl_destruct
X<perl_destruct>

Shuts down a Perl interpreter.  See L<perlembed> for a tutorial.

C<my_perl> points to the Perl interpreter.  It must have been previously
created through the use of L</perl_alloc> and L</perl_construct>.  It may
have been initialised through L</perl_parse>, and may have been used
through L</perl_run> and other means.  This function should be called for
any Perl interpreter that has been constructed with L</perl_construct>,
even if subsequent operations on it failed, for example if L</perl_parse>
returned a non-zero value.

If the interpreter's C<PL_exit_flags> word has the
C<PERL_EXIT_DESTRUCT_END> flag set, then this function will execute code
in C<END> blocks before performing the rest of destruction.  If it is
desired to make any use of the interpreter between L</perl_parse> and
L</perl_destruct> other than just calling L</perl_run>, then this flag
should be set early on.  This matters if L</perl_run> will not be called,
or if anything else will be done in addition to calling L</perl_run>.

Returns a value be a suitable value to pass to the C library function
C<exit> (or to return from C<main>), to serve as an exit code indicating
the nature of the way the interpreter terminated.  This takes into account
any failure of L</perl_parse> and any early exit from L</perl_run>.
The exit code is of the type required by the host operating system,
so because of differing exit code conventions it is not portable to
interpret specific numeric values as having specific meanings.

=item perl_parse
X<perl_parse>

Tells a Perl interpreter to parse a Perl script.  This performs most
of the initialisation of a Perl interpreter.  See L<perlembed> for
a tutorial.

C<my_perl> points to the Perl interpreter that is to parse the script.
It must have been previously created through the use of L</perl_alloc>
and L</perl_construct>.  C<xsinit> points to a callback function that
will be called to set up the ability for this Perl interpreter to load
XS extensions, or may be null to perform no such setup.

C<argc> and C<argv> supply a set of command-line arguments to the Perl
interpreter, as would normally be passed to the C<main> function of
a C program.  C<argv[argc]> must be null.  These arguments are where
the script to parse is specified, either by naming a script file or by
providing a script in a C<-e> option.
If L<C<$0>|perlvar/$0> will be written to in the Perl interpreter, then
the argument strings must be in writable memory, and so mustn't just be
string constants.

C<env> specifies a set of environment variables that will be used by
this Perl interpreter.  If non-null, it must point to a null-terminated
array of environment strings.  If null, the Perl interpreter will use
the environment supplied by the C<environ> global variable.

This function initialises the interpreter, and parses and compiles the
script specified by the command-line arguments.  This includes executing
code in C<BEGIN>, C<UNITCHECK>, and C<CHECK> blocks.  It does not execute
C<INIT> blocks or the main program.

Returns an integer of slightly tricky interpretation.  The correct
use of the return value is as a truth value indicating whether there
was a failure in initialisation.  If zero is returned, this indicates
that initialisation was successful, and it is safe to proceed to call
L</perl_run> and make other use of it.  If a non-zero value is returned,
this indicates some problem that means the interpreter wants to terminate.
The interpreter should not be just abandoned upon such failure; the caller
should proceed to shut the interpreter down cleanly with L</perl_destruct>
and free it with L</perl_free>.

For historical reasons, the non-zero return value also attempts to
be a suitable value to pass to the C library function C<exit> (or to
return from C<main>), to serve as an exit code indicating the nature
of the way initialisation terminated.  However, this isn't portable,
due to differing exit code conventions.  A historical bug is preserved
for the time being: if the Perl built-in C<exit> is called during this
function's execution, with a type of exit entailing a zero exit code
under the host operating system's conventions, then this function
returns zero rather than a non-zero value.  This bug, [perl #2754],
leads to C<perl_run> being called (and therefore C<INIT> blocks and the
main program running) despite a call to C<exit>.  It has been preserved
because a popular module-installing module has come to rely on it and
needs time to be fixed.  This issue is [perl #132577], and the original
bug is due to be fixed in Perl 5.30.

=item perl_run
X<perl_run>

Tells a Perl interpreter to run its main program.  See L<perlembed>
for a tutorial.

C<my_perl> points to the Perl interpreter.  It must have been previously
created through the use of L</perl_alloc> and L</perl_construct>, and
initialised through L</perl_parse>.  This function should not be called
if L</perl_parse> returned a non-zero value, indicating a failure in
initialisation or compilation.

This function executes code in C<INIT> blocks, and then executes the
main program.  The code to be executed is that established by the prior
call to L</perl_parse>.  If the interpreter's C<PL_exit_flags> word
does not have the C<PERL_EXIT_DESTRUCT_END> flag set, then this function
will also execute code in C<END> blocks.  If it is desired to make any
further use of the interpreter after calling this function, then C<END>
blocks should be postponed to L</perl_destruct> time by setting that flag.

Returns an integer of slightly tricky interpretation.  The correct use
of the return value is as a truth value indicating whether the program
terminated non-locally.  If zero is returned, this indicates that
the program ran to completion, and it is safe to make other use of the
interpreter (provided that the C<PERL_EXIT_DESTRUCT_END> flag was set as
described above).  If a non-zero value is returned, this indicates that
the interpreter wants to terminate early.  The interpreter should not be
just abandoned because of this desire to terminate; the caller should
proceed to shut the interpreter down cleanly with L</perl_destruct>
and free it with L</perl_free>.

For historical reasons, the non-zero return value also attempts to
be a suitable value to pass to the C library function C<exit> (or to
return from C<main>), to serve as an exit code indicating the nature of
the way the program terminated.  However, this isn't portable, due to
differing exit code conventions.  An attempt is made to return an exit
code of the type required by the host operating system, but because
it is constrained to be non-zero, it is not necessarily possible to
indicate every type of exit.  It is only reliable on Unix, where a zero
exit code can be augmented with a set bit that will be ignored.  In any
case, this function is not the correct place to acquire an exit code:
one should get that from L</perl_destruct>.

=head1 Global Variables

These variables are global to an entire process.  They are shared between
all interpreters and all threads in a process.  Any variables not documented
here may be changed or removed without notice, so don't use them!
If you feel you really do need to use an unlisted variable, first send email to
L<perl5-porters@perl.org|mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org>.  It may be that
someone there will point out a way to accomplish what you need without using an
internal variable.  But if not, you should get a go-ahead to document and then
use the variable.

=item PL_check
X<PL_check>

Array, indexed by opcode, of functions that will be called for the "check"
phase of optree building during compilation of Perl code.  For most (but
not all) types of op, once the op has been initially built and populated
with child ops it will be filtered through the check function referenced
by the appropriate element of this array.  The new op is passed in as the
sole argument to the check function, and the check function returns the
completed op.  The check function may (as the name suggests) check the op
for validity and signal errors.  It may also initialise or modify parts of
the ops, or perform more radical surgery such as adding or removing child
ops, or even throw the op away and return a different op in its place.

This array of function pointers is a convenient place to hook into the
compilation process.  An XS module can put its own custom check function
in place of any of the standard ones, to influence the compilation of a
particular type of op.  However, a custom check function must never fully
replace a standard check function (or even a custom check function from
another module).  A module modifying checking must instead B<wrap> the
preexisting check function.  A custom check function must be selective
about when to apply its custom behaviour.  In the usual case where
it decides not to do anything special with an op, it must chain the
preexisting op function.  Check functions are thus linked in a chain,
with the core's base checker at the end.

For thread safety, modules should not write directly to this array.
Instead, use the function L</wrap_op_checker>.

=item PL_keyword_plugin
X<PL_keyword_plugin>


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


Function pointer, pointing at a function used to handle extended keywords.
The function should be declared as

	int keyword_plugin_function(pTHX_
		char *keyword_ptr, STRLEN keyword_len,
		OP **op_ptr)

The function is called from the tokeniser, whenever a possible keyword
is seen.  C<keyword_ptr> points at the word in the parser's input
buffer, and C<keyword_len> gives its length; it is not null-terminated.
The function is expected to examine the word, and possibly other state
such as L<%^H|perlvar/%^H>, to decide whether it wants to handle it
as an extended keyword.  If it does not, the function should return
C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_DECLINE>, and the normal parser process will continue.

If the function wants to handle the keyword, it first must
parse anything following the keyword that is part of the syntax
introduced by the keyword.  See L</Lexer interface> for details.

When a keyword is being handled, the plugin function must build
a tree of C<OP> structures, representing the code that was parsed.
The root of the tree must be stored in C<*op_ptr>.  The function then
returns a constant indicating the syntactic role of the construct that
it has parsed: C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_STMT> if it is a complete statement, or
C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_EXPR> if it is an expression.  Note that a statement
construct cannot be used inside an expression (except via C<do BLOCK>
and similar), and an expression is not a complete statement (it requires
at least a terminating semicolon).

When a keyword is handled, the plugin function may also have
(compile-time) side effects.  It may modify C<%^H>, define functions, and
so on.  Typically, if side effects are the main purpose of a handler,
it does not wish to generate any ops to be included in the normal
compilation.  In this case it is still required to supply an op tree,
but it suffices to generate a single null op.

That's how the C<*PL_keyword_plugin> function needs to behave overall.
Conventionally, however, one does not completely replace the existing
handler function.  Instead, take a copy of C<PL_keyword_plugin> before
assigning your own function pointer to it.  Your handler function should
look for keywords that it is interested in and handle those.  Where it
is not interested, it should call the saved plugin function, passing on
the arguments it received.  Thus C<PL_keyword_plugin> actually points
at a chain of handler functions, all of which have an opportunity to
handle keywords, and only the last function in the chain (built into
the Perl core) will normally return C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_DECLINE>.

For thread safety, modules should not set this variable directly.
Instead, use the function L</wrap_keyword_plugin>.

=head1 GV Functions

A GV is a structure which corresponds to to a Perl typeglob, ie *foo.
It is a structure that holds a pointer to a scalar, an array, a hash etc,
corresponding to $foo, @foo, %foo.

GVs are usually found as values in stashes (symbol table hashes) where
Perl stores its global variables.

=item gv_fetchmethod_autoload
X<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>

Returns the glob which contains the subroutine to call to invoke the method
on the C<stash>.  In fact in the presence of autoloading this may be the
glob for "AUTOLOAD".  In this case the corresponding variable C<$AUTOLOAD> is
already setup.

The third parameter of C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload> determines whether
AUTOLOAD lookup is performed if the given method is not present: non-zero
means yes, look for AUTOLOAD; zero means no, don't look for AUTOLOAD.
Calling C<gv_fetchmethod> is equivalent to calling C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>
with a non-zero C<autoload> parameter.

These functions grant C<"SUPER"> token
as a prefix of the method name.  Note
that if you want to keep the returned glob for a long time, you need to
check for it being "AUTOLOAD", since at the later time the call may load a
different subroutine due to C<$AUTOLOAD> changing its value.  Use the glob
created as a side effect to do this.

These functions have the same side-effects as C<gv_fetchmeth> with
C<level==0>.  The warning against passing the GV returned by
C<gv_fetchmeth> to C<call_sv> applies equally to these functions.

=item gv_fetchmeth_pvn
X<gv_fetchmeth_pvn>

Returns the glob with the given C<name> and a defined subroutine or
C<NULL>.  The glob lives in the given C<stash>, or in the stashes
accessible via C<@ISA> and C<UNIVERSAL::>.

The argument C<level> should be either 0 or -1.  If C<level==0>, as a
side-effect creates a glob with the given C<name> in the given C<stash>
which in the case of success contains an alias for the subroutine, and sets
up caching info for this glob.

The only significant values for C<flags> are C<GV_SUPER> and C<SVf_UTF8>.

C<GV_SUPER> indicates that we want to look up the method in the superclasses
of the C<stash>.

The
GV returned from C<gv_fetchmeth> may be a method cache entry, which is not
visible to Perl code.  So when calling C<call_sv>, you should not use
the GV directly; instead, you should use the method's CV, which can be
obtained from the GV with the C<GvCV> macro.

X<gv_init_pvn>

Converts a scalar into a typeglob.  This is an incoercible typeglob;
assigning a reference to it will assign to one of its slots, instead of
overwriting it as happens with typeglobs created by C<SvSetSV>.  Converting
any scalar that is C<SvOK()> may produce unpredictable results and is reserved
for perl's internal use.

C<gv> is the scalar to be converted.

C<stash> is the parent stash/package, if any.

C<name> and C<len> give the name.  The name must be unqualified;
that is, it must not include the package name.  If C<gv> is a
stash element, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the name
passed to this function matches the name of the element.  If it does not
match, perl's internal bookkeeping will get out of sync.

C<flags> can be set to C<SVf_UTF8> if C<name> is a UTF-8 string, or
the return value of SvUTF8(sv).  It can also take the
C<GV_ADDMULTI> flag, which means to pretend that the GV has been

A HV structure represents a Perl hash.  It consists mainly of an array
of pointers, each of which points to a linked list of HE structures.  The
array is indexed by the hash function of the key, so each linked list
represents all the hash entries with the same hash value.  Each HE contains
a pointer to the actual value, plus a pointer to a HEK structure which
holds the key and hash value.

effective name represents a location in the symbol table where this stash
resides.  It is updated automatically when packages are aliased or deleted.
A stash that is no longer in the symbol table has no effective name.  This
name is preferable to C<HvNAME> for use in MRO linearisations and isa
caches.

X<hv_fetch>

Returns the SV which corresponds to the specified key in the hash.
The absolute value of C<klen> is the length of the key.  If C<klen> is
negative the key is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  If
C<lval> is set then the fetch will be part of a store.  This means that if
there is no value in the hash associated with the given key, then one is
created and a pointer to it is returned.  The C<SV*> it points to can be
assigned to.  But always check that the
return value is non-null before dereferencing it to an C<SV*>.

Returns the number of hash buckets that happen to be in use.

This function is wrapped by the macro C<HvFILL>.

As of perl 5.25 this function is used only for debugging

The return value is currently only meaningful for hashes without tie magic.

NOTE: Before version 5.004_65, C<hv_iterinit> used to return the number of

with your iterator holding the last reference to it.  Your iterator is flagged

Returns entries from a hash iterator.  See C<L</hv_iterinit>> and

The C<flags> value will normally be zero; if C<HV_ITERNEXT_WANTPLACEHOLDERS> is
set the placeholders keys (for restricted hashes) will be returned in addition
to normal keys.  By default placeholders are automatically skipped over.
Currently a placeholder is implemented with a value that is
C<&PL_sv_placeholder>.  Note that the implementation of placeholders and
restricted hashes may change, and the implementation currently is
insufficiently abstracted for any change to be tidy.

=item hv_store
X<hv_store>

Stores an SV in a hash.  The hash key is specified as C<key> and the
absolute value of C<klen> is the length of the key.  If C<klen> is
negative the key is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  The
C<hash> parameter is the precomputed hash value; if it is zero then
Perl will compute it.

The return value will be
C<NULL> if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise it can
be dereferenced to get the original C<SV*>.  Note that the caller is
responsible for suitably incrementing the reference count of C<val> before
the call, and decrementing it if the function returned C<NULL>.  Effectively
a successful C<hv_store> takes ownership of one reference to C<val>.  This is
usually what you want; a newly created SV has a reference count of one, so
if all your code does is create SVs then store them in a hash, C<hv_store>
will own the only reference to the new SV, and your code doesn't need to do
anything further to tidy up.  C<hv_store> is not implemented as a call to
C<hv_store_ent>, and does not create a temporary SV for the key, so if your
key data is not already in SV form then use C<hv_store> in preference to
C<hv_store_ent>.

compute it.  The return value is the new hash entry so created.  It will be
C<NULL> if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise the
contents of the return value can be accessed using the C<He?> macros
described here.  Note that the caller is responsible for suitably
incrementing the reference count of C<val> before the call, and
decrementing it if the function returned NULL.  Effectively a successful
C<hv_store_ent> takes ownership of one reference to C<val>.  This is

unlike C<val> it does not take ownership of it, so maintaining the correct
reference count on C<key> is entirely the caller's responsibility.  C<hv_store>

=head1 Hook manipulation

These functions provide convenient and thread-safe means of manipulating
hook variables.


=over 8

=item wrap_op_checker
X<wrap_op_checker>

Puts a C function into the chain of check functions for a specified op
type.  This is the preferred way to manipulate the L</PL_check> array.
C<opcode> specifies which type of op is to be affected.  C<new_checker>
is a pointer to the C function that is to be added to that opcode's
check chain, and C<old_checker_p> points to the storage location where a
pointer to the next function in the chain will be stored.  The value of
C<new_checker> is written into the L</PL_check> array, while the value
previously stored there is written to C<*old_checker_p>.

L</PL_check> is global to an entire process, and a module wishing to
hook op checking may find itself invoked more than once per process,
typically in different threads.  To handle that situation, this function
is idempotent.  The location C<*old_checker_p> must initially (once
per process) contain a null pointer.  A C variable of static duration
(declared at file scope, typically also marked C<static> to give
it internal linkage) will be implicitly initialised appropriately,
if it does not have an explicit initialiser.  This function will only
actually modify the check chain if it finds C<*old_checker_p> to be null.
This function is also thread safe on the small scale.  It uses appropriate
locking to avoid race conditions in accessing L</PL_check>.

When this function is called, the function referenced by C<new_checker>
must be ready to be called, except for C<*old_checker_p> being unfilled.
In a threading situation, C<new_checker> may be called immediately,
even before this function has returned.  C<*old_checker_p> will always
be appropriately set before C<new_checker> is called.  If C<new_checker>
decides not to do anything special with an op that it is given (which
is the usual case for most uses of op check hooking), it must chain the
check function referenced by C<*old_checker_p>.

Taken all together, XS code to hook an op checker should typically look
something like this:

    static Perl_check_t nxck_frob;
    static OP *myck_frob(pTHX_ OP *op) {
	...
	op = nxck_frob(aTHX_ op);
	...
	return op;
    }
    BOOT:
	wrap_op_checker(OP_FROB, myck_frob, &nxck_frob);

If you want to influence compilation of calls to a specific subroutine,
then use L</cv_set_call_checker_flags> rather than hooking checking of
all C<entersub> ops.

		                Perl_check_t new_checker,

This is the lower layer of the Perl parser, managing characters and tokens.


=over 8

=item lex_bufutf8
X<lex_bufutf8>


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


Indicates whether the octets in the lexer buffer
(L</PL_parser-E<gt>linestr>) should be interpreted as the UTF-8 encoding
of Unicode characters.  If not, they should be interpreted as Latin-1
characters.  This is analogous to the C<SvUTF8> flag for scalars.

In UTF-8 mode, it is not guaranteed that the lexer buffer actually
contains valid UTF-8.  Lexing code must be robust in the face of invalid
encoding.

The actual C<SvUTF8> flag of the L</PL_parser-E<gt>linestr> scalar
is significant, but not the whole story regarding the input character
encoding.  Normally, when a file is being read, the scalar contains octets
and its C<SvUTF8> flag is off, but the octets should be interpreted as
UTF-8 if the C<use utf8> pragma is in effect.  During a string eval,
however, the scalar may have the C<SvUTF8> flag on, and in this case its
octets should be interpreted as UTF-8 unless the C<use bytes> pragma
is in effect.  This logic may change in the future; use this function
instead of implementing the logic yourself.

Discards the first part of the L</PL_parser-E<gt>linestr> buffer,

all pointers into the buffer updated appropriately.  C<ptr> must not
be later in the buffer than the position of L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufptr>:
it is not permitted to discard text that has yet to be lexed.

Normally it is not necessarily to do this directly, because it suffices to
use the implicit discarding behaviour of L</lex_next_chunk> and things
based on it.  However, if a token stretches across multiple lines,
and the lexing code has kept multiple lines of text in the buffer for
that purpose, then after completion of the token it would be wise to
explicitly discard the now-unneeded earlier lines, to avoid future
multi-line tokens growing the buffer without bound.

pointer to the reallocated buffer.  This is necessary before making
any direct modification of the buffer that would increase its length.

the buffer.

Do not use C<SvGROW> or C<sv_grow> directly on C<PL_parser-E<gt>linestr>;

Reads in the next chunk of text to be lexed, appending it to

looked to the end of the current chunk and wants to know more.  It is
usual, but not necessary, for lexing to have consumed the entirety of
the current chunk at this time.

If L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufptr> is pointing to the very end of the current
chunk (i.e., the current chunk has been entirely consumed), normally the
current chunk will be discarded at the same time that the new chunk is
read in.  If C<flags> has the C<LEX_KEEP_PREVIOUS> bit set, the current chunk
will not be discarded.  If the current chunk has not been entirely
consumed, then it will not be discarded regardless of the flag.

Returns true if some new text was added to the buffer, or false if the
buffer has reached the end of the input text.

peeked character, use L</lex_read_unichar>.

If the next character is in (or extends into) the next chunk of input
text, the next chunk will be read in.  Normally the current chunk will be
discarded at the same time, but if C<flags> has the C<LEX_KEEP_PREVIOUS>
bit set, then the current chunk will not be discarded.

If the input is being interpreted as UTF-8 and a UTF-8 encoding error
is encountered, an exception is generated.

Perl-style comments.  C<#line> directives are processed if encountered.
L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufptr> is moved past the spaces, so that it points
at a non-space character (or the end of the input text).

If spaces extend into the next chunk of input text, the next chunk will
be read in.  Normally the current chunk will be discarded at the same
time, but if C<flags> has the C<LEX_KEEP_PREVIOUS> bit set, then the current
chunk will not be discarded.

This is the normal way to consume lexed text.

if lexing has reached the end of the input text.  To non-destructively
examine the next character, use L</lex_peek_unichar> instead.

If the next character is in (or extends into) the next chunk of input
text, the next chunk will be read in.  Normally the current chunk will be

Creates and initialises a new lexer/parser state object, supplying
a context in which to lex and parse from a new source of Perl code.
A pointer to the new state object is placed in L</PL_parser>.  An entry
is made on the save stack so that upon unwinding, the new state object
will be destroyed and the former value of L</PL_parser> will be restored.
Nothing else need be done to clean up the parsing context.

The code to be parsed comes from C<line> and C<rsfp>.  C<line>, if
non-null, provides a string (in SV form) containing code to be parsed.
A copy of the string is made, so subsequent modification of C<line>
does not affect parsing.  C<rsfp>, if non-null, provides an input stream
from which code will be read to be parsed.  If both are non-null, the
code in C<line> comes first and must consist of complete lines of input,
and C<rsfp> supplies the remainder of the source.

The C<flags> parameter is reserved for future use.  Currently it is only
used by perl internally, so extensions should always pass zero.

Insert characters into the lexer buffer (L</PL_parser-E<gt>linestr>),

It is not recommended to do this as part of normal parsing, and most

interpreted in an unintended manner.

The string to be inserted is represented by octets starting at C<pv>
and continuing to the first nul.  These octets are interpreted as either
UTF-8 or Latin-1, according to whether the C<LEX_STUFF_UTF8> flag is set

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be

Parse a Perl arithmetic expression.  This may contain operators of precedence
down to the bit shift operators.  The expression must be followed (and thus
terminated) either by a comparison or lower-precedence operator or by
something that would normally terminate an expression such as semicolon.
If C<flags> has the C<PARSE_OPTIONAL> bit set, then the expression is optional,
otherwise it is mandatory.  It is up to the caller to ensure that the
dynamic parser state (L</PL_parser> et al) is correctly set to reflect
the source of the code to be parsed and the lexical context for the
expression.

The op tree representing the expression is returned.  If an optional
expression is absent, a null pointer is returned, otherwise the pointer
will be non-null.

If an error occurs in parsing or compilation, in most cases a valid op
tree is returned anyway.  The error is reflected in the parser state,
normally resulting in a single exception at the top level of parsing
which covers all the compilation errors that occurred.  Some compilation
errors, however, will throw an exception immediately.

Lexing code (whether in the Perl core or not) moves this pointer past

can be more conveniently performed by the function L</lex_read_to>,

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be

Buffer scalar containing the chunk currently under consideration of the
text currently being lexed.  This is always a plain string scalar (for
which C<SvPOK> is true).  It is not intended to be used as a scalar by
normal scalar means; instead refer to the buffer directly by the pointer
variables described below.

The lexer maintains various C<char*> pointers to things in the
C<PL_parser-E<gt>linestr> buffer.  If C<PL_parser-E<gt>linestr> is ever
reallocated, all of these pointers must be updated.  Don't attempt to
do this manually, but rather use L</lex_grow_linestr> if you need to
reallocate the buffer.

The content of the text chunk in the buffer is commonly exactly one
complete line of input, up to and including a newline terminator,
but there are situations where it is otherwise.  The octets of the
buffer may be intended to be interpreted as either UTF-8 or Latin-1.
The function L</lex_bufutf8> tells you which.  Do not use the C<SvUTF8>
flag on this scalar, which may disagree with it.

For direct examination of the buffer, the variable
L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufend> points to the end of the buffer.  The current
lexing position is pointed to by L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufptr>.  Direct use
of these pointers is usually preferable to examination of the scalar
through normal scalar means.

=item wrap_keyword_plugin
X<wrap_keyword_plugin>


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


Puts a C function into the chain of keyword plugins.  This is the
preferred way to manipulate the L</PL_keyword_plugin> variable.
C<new_plugin> is a pointer to the C function that is to be added to the
keyword plugin chain, and C<old_plugin_p> points to the storage location
where a pointer to the next function in the chain will be stored.  The
value of C<new_plugin> is written into the L</PL_keyword_plugin> variable,
while the value previously stored there is written to C<*old_plugin_p>.

L</PL_keyword_plugin> is global to an entire process, and a module wishing
to hook keyword parsing may find itself invoked more than once per
process, typically in different threads.  To handle that situation, this
function is idempotent.  The location C<*old_plugin_p> must initially
(once per process) contain a null pointer.  A C variable of static
duration (declared at file scope, typically also marked C<static> to give
it internal linkage) will be implicitly initialised appropriately, if it
does not have an explicit initialiser.  This function will only actually
modify the plugin chain if it finds C<*old_plugin_p> to be null.  This
function is also thread safe on the small scale.  It uses appropriate
locking to avoid race conditions in accessing L</PL_keyword_plugin>.

When this function is called, the function referenced by C<new_plugin>
must be ready to be called, except for C<*old_plugin_p> being unfilled.
In a threading situation, C<new_plugin> may be called immediately, even
before this function has returned.  C<*old_plugin_p> will always be
appropriately set before C<new_plugin> is called.  If C<new_plugin>
decides not to do anything special with the identifier that it is given
(which is the usual case for most calls to a keyword plugin), it must
chain the plugin function referenced by C<*old_plugin_p>.

Taken all together, XS code to install a keyword plugin should typically
look something like this:

    static Perl_keyword_plugin_t next_keyword_plugin;
    static OP *my_keyword_plugin(pTHX_
        char *keyword_plugin, STRLEN keyword_len, OP **op_ptr)
    {
        if (memEQs(keyword_ptr, keyword_len,
                   "my_new_keyword")) {
            ...
        } else {
            return next_keyword_plugin(aTHX_
                keyword_ptr, keyword_len, op_ptr);
        }
    }
    BOOT:
        wrap_keyword_plugin(my_keyword_plugin,
                            &next_keyword_plugin);

Direct access to L</PL_keyword_plugin> should be avoided.

=item Perl_langinfo
X<Perl_langinfo>

This is an (almost) drop-in replacement for the system C<L<nl_langinfo(3)>>,
taking the same C<item> parameter values, and returning the same information.
But it is more thread-safe than regular C<nl_langinfo()>, and hides the quirks
of Perl's locale handling from your code, and can be used on systems that lack
a native C<nl_langinfo>.

Expanding on these:

=over

=item *

The reason it isn't quite a drop-in replacement is actually an advantage.  The
only difference is that it returns S<C<const char *>>, whereas plain
C<nl_langinfo()> returns S<C<char *>>, but you are (only by documentation)
forbidden to write into the buffer.  By declaring this C<const>, the compiler
enforces this restriction, so if it is violated, you know at compilation time,
rather than getting segfaults at runtime.

=item *

It delivers the correct results for the C<RADIXCHAR> and C<THOUSEP> items,
without you having to write extra code.  The reason for the extra code would be
because these are from the C<LC_NUMERIC> locale category, which is normally
kept set by Perl so that the radix is a dot, and the separator is the empty
string, no matter what the underlying locale is supposed to be, and so to get
the expected results, you have to temporarily toggle into the underlying
locale, and later toggle back.  (You could use plain C<nl_langinfo> and
C<L</STORE_LC_NUMERIC_FORCE_TO_UNDERLYING>> for this but then you wouldn't get
the other advantages of C<Perl_langinfo()>; not keeping C<LC_NUMERIC> in the C
(or equivalent) locale would break a lot of CPAN, which is expecting the radix
(decimal point) character to be a dot.)

=item *

The system function it replaces can have its static return buffer trashed,
not only by a subesequent call to that function, but by a C<freelocale>,
C<setlocale>, or other locale change.  The returned buffer of this function is
not changed until the next call to it, so the buffer is never in a trashed
state.

=item *

Its return buffer is per-thread, so it also is never overwritten by a call to
this function from another thread;  unlike the function it replaces.

=item *

But most importantly, it works on systems that don't have C<nl_langinfo>, such
as Windows, hence makes your code more portable.  Of the fifty-some possible
items specified by the POSIX 2008 standard,
L<http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/langinfo.h.html>,
only one is completely unimplemented, though on non-Windows platforms, another
significant one is also not implemented).  It uses various techniques to
recover the other items, including calling C<L<localeconv(3)>>, and
C<L<strftime(3)>>, both of which are specified in C89, so should be always be
available.  Later C<strftime()> versions have additional capabilities; C<""> is
returned for those not available on your system.

It is important to note that when called with an item that is recovered by
using C<localeconv>, the buffer from any previous explicit call to
C<localeconv> will be overwritten.  This means you must save that buffer's
contents if you need to access them after a call to this function.  (But note
that you might not want to be using C<localeconv()> directly anyway, because of
issues like the ones listed in the second item of this list (above) for
C<RADIXCHAR> and C<THOUSEP>.  You can use the methods given in L<perlcall> to
call L<POSIX/localeconv> and avoid all the issues, but then you have a hash to
unpack).

The details for those items which may deviate from what this emulation returns
and what a native C<nl_langinfo()> would return are specified in
L<I18N::Langinfo>.

=back

When using C<Perl_langinfo> on systems that don't have a native
C<nl_langinfo()>, you must

 #include "perl_langinfo.h"

before the C<perl.h> C<#include>.  You can replace your C<langinfo.h>
C<#include> with this one.  (Doing it this way keeps out the symbols that plain
C<langinfo.h> would try to import into the namespace for code that doesn't need
it.)

The original impetus for C<Perl_langinfo()> was so that code that needs to
find out the current currency symbol, floating point radix character, or digit
grouping separator can use, on all systems, the simpler and more
thread-friendly C<nl_langinfo> API instead of C<L<localeconv(3)>> which is a
pain to make thread-friendly.  For other fields returned by C<localeconv>, it
is better to use the methods given in L<perlcall> to call
L<C<POSIX::localeconv()>|POSIX/localeconv>, which is thread-friendly.

=item Perl_setlocale
X<Perl_setlocale>

This is an (almost) drop-in replacement for the system L<C<setlocale(3)>>,
taking the same parameters, and returning the same information, except that it
returns the correct underlying C<LC_NUMERIC> locale.  Regular C<setlocale> will
instead return C<C> if the underlying locale has a non-dot decimal point
character, or a non-empty thousands separator for displaying floating point
numbers.  This is because perl keeps that locale category such that it has a
dot and empty separator, changing the locale briefly during the operations
where the underlying one is required. C<Perl_setlocale> knows about this, and
compensates; regular C<setlocale> doesn't.

Another reason it isn't completely a drop-in replacement is that it is
declared to return S<C<const char *>>, whereas the system setlocale omits the
C<const> (presumably because its API was specified long ago, and can't be
updated; it is illegal to change the information C<setlocale> returns; doing
so leads to segfaults.)

Finally, C<Perl_setlocale> works under all circumstances, whereas plain
C<setlocale> can be completely ineffective on some platforms under some
configurations.

C<Perl_setlocale> should not be used to change the locale except on systems
where the predefined variable C<${^SAFE_LOCALES}> is 1.  On some such systems,
the system C<setlocale()> is ineffective, returning the wrong information, and
failing to actually change the locale.  C<Perl_setlocale>, however works
properly in all circumstances.

The return points to a per-thread static buffer, which is overwritten the next
time C<Perl_setlocale> is called from the same thread.

This is used to help wrap XS or C code that is C<LC_NUMERIC> locale-aware.
This locale category is generally kept set to a locale where the decimal radix
character is a dot, and the separator between groups of digits is empty.  This
is because most XS code that reads floating point numbers is expecting them to
have this syntax.

This macro makes sure the current C<LC_NUMERIC> state is set properly, to be
aware of locale if the call to the XS or C code from the Perl program is
from within the scope of a S<C<use locale>>; or to ignore locale if the call is
instead from outside such scope.

This macro is the start of wrapping the C or XS code; the wrap ending is done
by calling the L</RESTORE_LC_NUMERIC> macro after the operation.  Otherwise
the state can be changed that will adversely affect other XS code.

=item switch_to_global_locale
X<switch_to_global_locale>

On systems without locale support, or on single-threaded builds, or on
platforms that do not support per-thread locale operations, this function does
nothing.  On such systems that do have locale support, only a locale global to
the whole program is available.

On multi-threaded builds on systems that do have per-thread locale operations,
this function converts the thread it is running in to use the global locale.
This is for code that has not yet or cannot be updated to handle multi-threaded
locale operation.  As long as only a single thread is so-converted, everything
works fine, as all the other threads continue to ignore the global one, so only
this thread looks at it.

However, on Windows systems this isn't quite true prior to Visual Studio 15,
at which point Microsoft fixed a bug.  A race can occur if you use the
following operations on earlier Windows platforms:

=over

=item L<POSIX::localeconv|POSIX/localeconv>

=item L<I18N::Langinfo>, items C<CRNCYSTR> and C<THOUSEP>

=item L<perlapi/Perl_langinfo>, items C<CRNCYSTR> and C<THOUSEP>

=back

The first item is not fixable (except by upgrading to a later Visual Studio
release), but it would be possible to work around the latter two items by using
the Windows API functions C<GetNumberFormat> and C<GetCurrencyFormat>; patches
welcome.

Without this function call, threads that use the L<C<setlocale(3)>> system
function will not work properly, as all the locale-sensitive functions will
look at the per-thread locale, and C<setlocale> will have no effect on this
thread.

Perl code should convert to either call
L<C<Perl_setlocale>|perlapi/Perl_setlocale> (which is a drop-in for the system
C<setlocale>) or use the methods given in L<perlcall> to call
L<C<POSIX::setlocale>|POSIX/setlocale>.  Either one will transparently properly
handle all cases of single- vs multi-thread, POSIX 2008-supported or not.

Non-Perl libraries, such as C<gtk>, that call the system C<setlocale> can
continue to work if this function is called before transferring control to the
library.

Upon return from the code that needs to use the global locale,
L<C<sync_locale()>|perlapi/sync_locale> should be called to restore the safe
multi-thread operation.

	void	switch_to_global_locale()

=for hackers
Found in file locale.c

=item sync_locale
X<sync_locale>

L<C<Perl_setlocale>|perlapi/Perl_setlocale> can be used at any time to query or
change the locale (though changing the locale is antisocial and dangerous on
multi-threaded systems that don't have multi-thread safe locale operations.
(See L<perllocale/Multi-threaded operation>).  Using the system
L<C<setlocale(3)>> should be avoided.  Nevertheless, certain non-Perl libraries
called from XS, such as C<Gtk> do so, and this can't be changed.  When the
locale is changed by XS code that didn't use
L<C<Perl_setlocale>|perlapi/Perl_setlocale>, Perl needs to be told that the
locale has changed.  Use this function to do so, before returning to Perl.

The return value is a boolean: TRUE if the global locale at the time of call
was in effect; and FALSE if a per-thread locale was in effect.  This can be
used by the caller that needs to restore things as-they-were to decide whether
or not to call
L<C<Perl_switch_to_global_locale>|perlapi/switch_to_global_locale>.

X<sv_string_from_errnum>

Generates the message string describing an OS error and returns it as
an SV.  C<errnum> must be a value that C<errno> could take, identifying
the type of error.

If C<tgtsv> is non-null then the string will be written into that SV
(overwriting existing content) and it will be returned.  If C<tgtsv>
is a null pointer then the string will be written into a new mortal SV
which will be returned.

The message will be taken from whatever locale would be used by C<$!>,
and will be encoded in the SV in whatever manner would be used by C<$!>.
The details of this process are subject to future change.  Currently,
the message is taken from the C locale by default (usually producing an
English message), and from the currently selected locale when in the scope
of the C<use locale> pragma.  A heuristic attempt is made to decode the
message from the locale's character encoding, but it will only be decoded
as either UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1.  It is always correctly decoded in a UTF-8
locale, usually in an ISO-8859-1 locale, and never in any other locale.

The SV is always returned containing an actual string, and with no other
OK bits set.  Unlike C<$!>, a message is even yielded for C<errnum> zero
(meaning success), and if no useful message is available then a useless
string (currently empty) is returned.

2   10df8d6d2:1d72   perl_parse   perl.c:3975    /usr/bin/perl
...

The fields are tab-separated.  The first column is the depth (zero
being the innermost non-skipped frame).  In the hex:offset, the hex is
where the program counter was in C<S_parse_body>, and the :offset (might
be missing) tells how much inside the C<S_parse_body> the program counter was.

The C<util.c:1716> is the source code file and line number.

The F</usr/bin/perl> is obvious (hopefully).

Unknowns are C<"-">.  Unknowns can happen unfortunately quite easily:
if the platform doesn't support retrieving the information;
if the binary is missing the debug information;
if the optimizer has transformed the code by for example inlining.

unless C<size> is 0 or the original C<dst> string was longer than C<size> (in
practice this should not happen as it means that either C<size> is incorrect or
that C<dst> is not a proper C<NUL>-terminated string).

Note that C<size> is the full size of the destination buffer and
the result is guaranteed to be C<NUL>-terminated if there is room.  Note that
room for the C<NUL> should be included in C<size>.

The return value is the total length that C<dst> would have if C<size> is
sufficiently large.  Thus it is the initial length of C<dst> plus the length of
C<src>.  If C<size> is smaller than the return, the excess was not appended.

=item ninstr
X<ninstr>

Find the first (leftmost) occurrence of a sequence of bytes within another
sequence.  This is the Perl version of C<strstr()>, extended to handle
arbitrary sequences, potentially containing embedded C<NUL> characters (C<NUL>
is what the initial C<n> in the function name stands for; some systems have an
equivalent, C<memmem()>, but with a somewhat different API).

Another way of thinking about this function is finding a needle in a haystack.
C<big> points to the first byte in the haystack.  C<big_end> points to one byte
beyond the final byte in the haystack.  C<little> points to the first byte in
the needle.  C<little_end> points to one byte beyond the final byte in the
needle.  All the parameters must be non-C<NULL>.

The function returns C<NULL> if there is no occurrence of C<little> within
C<big>.  If C<little> is the empty string, C<big> is returned.

Because this function operates at the byte level, and because of the inherent
characteristics of UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC), it will work properly if both the
needle and the haystack are strings with the same UTF-8ness, but not if the
UTF-8ness differs.

X<quadmath_format_needed>

C<quadmath_format_needed()> returns true if the C<format> string seems to
contain at least one non-Q-prefixed C<%[efgaEFGA]> format specifier,
or returns false otherwise.

The format specifier detection is not complete printf-syntax detection,
but it should catch most common cases.

If true is returned, those arguments B<should> in theory be processed
with C<quadmath_snprintf()>, but in case there is more than one such
format specifier (see L</quadmath_format_single>), and if there is
anything else beyond that one (even just a single byte), they
B<cannot> be processed because C<quadmath_snprintf()> is very strict,
accepting only one format spec, and nothing else.
In this case, the code should probably fail.

	bool	quadmath_format_needed(const char* format)

X<quadmath_format_single>

C<quadmath_snprintf()> is very strict about its C<format> string and will

one format spec.

C<quadmath_format_single()> checks that the intended single spec looks
sane: begins with C<%>, has only one C<%>, ends with C<[efgaEFGA]>,
and has C<Q> before it.  This is not a full "printf syntax check",
just the basics.

Returns the format if it is valid, NULL if not.

C<quadmath_format_single()> can and will actually patch in the missing
C<Q>, if necessary.  In this case it will return the modified copy of
the format, B<which the caller will need to free.>

Perl automatically handles most of the common
ways a method might be redefined.  However, there
are a few ways you could change a method in a stash
without the cache code noticing, in which case you
need to call this method afterwards:

1) Directly manipulating the stash HV entries from
XS code.

2) Assigning a reference to a readonly scalar
constant into a stash entry in order to create
a constant subroutine (like F<constant.pm>

converts a string representing a binary number to numeric form.

On entry C<start> and C<*len> give the string to scan, C<*flags> gives

The scan stops at the end of the string, or the first invalid character.
Unless C<PERL_SCAN_SILENT_ILLDIGIT> is set in C<*flags>, encountering an
invalid character will also trigger a warning.
On return C<*len> is set to the length of the scanned string,
and C<*flags> gives output flags.

If the value is <= C<UV_MAX> it is returned as a UV, the output flags are clear,
and nothing is written to C<*result>.  If the value is > C<UV_MAX>, C<grok_bin>
returns C<UV_MAX>, sets C<PERL_SCAN_GREATER_THAN_UV_MAX> in the output flags,

C<IS_NUMBER_NEG>, C<IS_NUMBER_INFINITY>, C<IS_NUMBER_NAN> (defined in perl.h).

If the value of the number can fit in a UV, it is returned in C<*valuep>.
C<IS_NUMBER_IN_UV> will be set to indicate that C<*valuep> is valid, C<IS_NUMBER_IN_UV>
will never be set unless C<*valuep> is valid, but C<*valuep> may have been assigned
to during processing even though C<IS_NUMBER_IN_UV> is not set on return.
If C<valuep> is C<NULL>, C<IS_NUMBER_IN_UV> will be set for the same cases as when
C<valuep> is non-C<NULL>, but no actual assignment (or SEGV) will occur.

C<IS_NUMBER_NOT_INT> will be set with C<IS_NUMBER_IN_UV> if trailing decimals were

=item utf8_to_uvuni
X<utf8_to_uvuni>


DEPRECATED!  It is planned to remove this function from a
future release of Perl.  Do not use it for new code; remove it from
existing code.


Returns the Unicode code point of the first character in the string C<s>
which is assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding; C<retlen> will be set to the
length, in bytes, of that character.

Some, but not all, UTF-8 malformations are detected, and in fact, some
malformed input could cause reading beyond the end of the input buffer, which
is one reason why this function is deprecated.  The other is that only in
extremely limited circumstances should the Unicode versus native code point be
of any interest to you.  See L</utf8_to_uvuni_buf> for alternatives.

If C<s> points to one of the detected malformations, and UTF8 warnings are
enabled, zero is returned and C<*retlen> is set (if C<retlen> doesn't point to
NULL) to -1.  If those warnings are off, the computed value if well-defined (or
the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, if not) is silently returned, and C<*retlen>
is set (if C<retlen> isn't NULL) so that (S<C<s> + C<*retlen>>) is the
next possible position in C<s> that could begin a non-malformed character.
See L</utf8n_to_uvchr> for details on when the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER is returned.

If C<optype> is C<OP_ANDASSIGN>, C<OP_ORASSIGN>, or C<OP_DORASSIGN>, then
a suitable conditional optree is constructed.  If C<optype> is the opcode

Alternatively, for convenience, it may be a subroutine object (a C<CV*>

supplied, in whichever form, does not need to match the actual callee
referenced by the op tree.

If the argument ops disagree with the prototype, for example by having

as a prototype, and if it is undefined then there is no prototype.
Alternatively, for convenience, it may be a subroutine object (a C<CV*>
that has been cast to C<SV*>), of which the prototype will be used if it
has one.  The prototype (or lack thereof) supplied, in whichever form,
does not need to match the actual callee referenced by the op tree.

If the argument ops disagree with the prototype, for example by having
an unacceptable number of arguments, a valid op tree is returned anyway.
The error is reflected in the parser state, normally resulting in a single
exception at the top level of parsing which covers all the compilation
errors that occurred.  In the error message, the callee is referred to
by the name defined by the C<namegv> parameter.

X<cv_get_call_checker_flags>

Retrieves the function that will be used to fix up a call to C<cv>.
Specifically, the function is applied to an C<entersub> op tree for a
subroutine call, not marked with C<&>, where the callee can be identified
at compile time as C<cv>.

The C-level function pointer is returned in C<*ckfun_p>, an SV argument
for it is returned in C<*ckobj_p>, and control flags are returned in
C<*ckflags_p>.  The function is intended to be called in this manner:

 entersubop = (*ckfun_p)(aTHX_ entersubop, namegv, (*ckobj_p));

In this call, C<entersubop> is a pointer to the C<entersub> op,
which may be replaced by the check function, and C<namegv> supplies
the name that should be used by the check function to refer
to the callee of the C<entersub> op if it needs to emit any diagnostics.
It is permitted to apply the check function in non-standard situations,
such as to a call to a different subroutine or to a method call.

C<namegv> may not actually be a GV.  If the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV>
bit is clear in C<*ckflags_p>, it is permitted to pass a CV or other SV
instead, anything that can be used as the first argument to L</cv_name>.
If the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV> bit is set in C<*ckflags_p> then the
check function requires C<namegv> to be a genuine GV.

By default, the check function is
L<Perl_ck_entersub_args_proto_or_list|/ck_entersub_args_proto_or_list>,
the SV parameter is C<cv> itself, and the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV>
flag is clear.  This implements standard prototype processing.  It can
be changed, for a particular subroutine, by L</cv_set_call_checker_flags>.

If the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV> bit is set in C<gflags> then it
indicates that the caller only knows about the genuine GV version of
C<namegv>, and accordingly the corresponding bit will always be set in
C<*ckflags_p>, regardless of the check function's recorded requirements.
If the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV> bit is clear in C<gflags> then it
indicates the caller knows about the possibility of passing something
other than a GV as C<namegv>, and accordingly the corresponding bit may
be either set or clear in C<*ckflags_p>, indicating the check function's
recorded requirements.

C<gflags> is a bitset passed into C<cv_get_call_checker_flags>, in which
only the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV> bit currently has a defined meaning
(for which see above).  All other bits should be clear.

Specifically, the function is applied to an C<entersub> op tree for a
subroutine call, not marked with C<&>, where the callee can be identified
at compile time as C<cv>.

The C-level function pointer is supplied in C<ckfun>, an SV argument for
it is supplied in C<ckobj>, and control flags are supplied in C<ckflags>.
The function should be defined like this:

    STATIC OP * ckfun(pTHX_ OP *op, GV *namegv, SV *ckobj)

It is intended to be called in this manner:

    entersubop = ckfun(aTHX_ entersubop, namegv, ckobj);

In this call, C<entersubop> is a pointer to the C<entersub> op,
which may be replaced by the check function, and C<namegv> supplies
the name that should be used by the check function to refer
to the callee of the C<entersub> op if it needs to emit any diagnostics.
It is permitted to apply the check function in non-standard situations,
such as to a call to a different subroutine or to a method call.

C<namegv> may not actually be a GV.  For efficiency, perl may pass a
CV or other SV instead.  Whatever is passed can be used as the first
argument to L</cv_name>.  You can force perl to pass a GV by including
C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV> in the C<ckflags>.

C<ckflags> is a bitset, in which only the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV>

=item newCONSTSUB_flags
X<newCONSTSUB_flags>

Construct a constant subroutine, also performing some surrounding
jobs.  A scalar constant-valued subroutine is eligible for inlining
at compile-time, and in Perl code can be created by S<C<sub FOO () {
123 }>>.  Other kinds of constant subroutine have other treatment.

The subroutine will have an empty prototype and will ignore any arguments
when called.  Its constant behaviour is determined by C<sv>.  If C<sv>
is null, the subroutine will yield an empty list.  If C<sv> points to a
scalar, the subroutine will always yield that scalar.  If C<sv> points
to an array, the subroutine will always yield a list of the elements of
that array in list context, or the number of elements in the array in
scalar context.  This function takes ownership of one counted reference
to the scalar or array, and will arrange for the object to live as long
as the subroutine does.  If C<sv> points to a scalar then the inlining
assumes that the value of the scalar will never change, so the caller
must ensure that the scalar is not subsequently written to.  If C<sv>
points to an array then no such assumption is made, so it is ostensibly
safe to mutate the array or its elements, but whether this is really
supported has not been determined.

The subroutine will have C<CvFILE> set according to C<PL_curcop>.
Other aspects of the subroutine will be left in their default state.
The caller is free to mutate the subroutine beyond its initial state
after this function has returned.

If C<name> is null then the subroutine will be anonymous, with its
C<CvGV> referring to an C<__ANON__> glob.  If C<name> is non-null then the
subroutine will be named accordingly, referenced by the appropriate glob.
C<name> is a string of length C<len> bytes giving a sigilless symbol
name, in UTF-8 if C<flags> has the C<SVf_UTF8> bit set and in Latin-1
otherwise.  The name may be either qualified or unqualified.  If the
name is unqualified then it defaults to being in the stash specified by
C<stash> if that is non-null, or to C<PL_curstash> if C<stash> is null.
The symbol is always added to the stash if necessary, with C<GV_ADDMULTI>
semantics.

C<flags> should not have bits set other than C<SVf_UTF8>.

If there is already a subroutine of the specified name, then the new sub
will replace the existing one in the glob.  A warning may be generated
about the redefinition.

If the subroutine has one of a few special names, such as C<BEGIN> or
C<END>, then it will be claimed by the appropriate queue for automatic
running of phase-related subroutines.  In this case the relevant glob will
be left not containing any subroutine, even if it did contain one before.
Execution of the subroutine will likely be a no-op, unless C<sv> was
a tied array or the caller modified the subroutine in some interesting
way before it was executed.  In the case of C<BEGIN>, the treatment is
buggy: the sub will be executed when only half built, and may be deleted
prematurely, possibly causing a crash.

The function returns a pointer to the constructed subroutine.  If the sub
is anonymous then ownership of one counted reference to the subroutine
is transferred to the caller.  If the sub is named then the caller does
not get ownership of a reference.  In most such cases, where the sub
has a non-phase name, the sub will be alive at the point it is returned
by virtue of being contained in the glob that names it.  A phase-named
subroutine will usually be alive by virtue of the reference owned by
the phase's automatic run queue.  A C<BEGIN> subroutine may have been
destroyed already by the time this function returns, but currently bugs
occur in that case before the caller gets control.  It is the caller's
responsibility to ensure that it knows which of these situations applies.

=item op_sibling_splice
X<op_sibling_splice>

A general function for editing the structure of an existing chain of
op_sibling nodes.  By analogy with the perl-level C<splice()> function, allows
you to delete zero or more sequential nodes, replacing them with zero or
more different nodes.  Performs the necessary op_first/op_last
housekeeping on the parent node and op_sibling manipulation on the
children.  The last deleted node will be marked as as the last node by
updating the op_sibling/op_sibparent or op_moresib field as appropriate.

Note that op_next is not manipulated, and nodes are not freed; that is the
responsibility of the caller.  It also won't create a new list op for an
empty list etc; use higher-level functions like op_append_elem() for that.

C<parent> is the parent node of the sibling chain. It may passed as C<NULL> if
the splicing doesn't affect the first or last op in the chain.

C<start> is the node preceding the first node to be spliced.  Node(s)
following it will be deleted, and ops will be inserted after it.  If it is
C<NULL>, the first node onwards is deleted, and nodes are inserted at the
beginning.

C<del_count> is the number of nodes to delete.  If zero, no nodes are deleted.
If -1 or greater than or equal to the number of remaining kids, all
remaining kids are deleted.

C<insert> is the first of a chain of nodes to be inserted in place of the nodes.
If C<NULL>, no nodes are inserted.

The head of the chain of deleted ops is returned, or C<NULL> if no ops were
deleted.

=item rv2cv_op_cv
X<rv2cv_op_cv>

Examines an op, which is expected to identify a subroutine at runtime,
and attempts to determine at compile time which subroutine it identifies.
This is normally used during Perl compilation to determine whether
a prototype can be applied to a function call.  C<cvop> is the op
being considered, normally an C<rv2cv> op.  A pointer to the identified
subroutine is returned, if it could be determined statically, and a null
pointer is returned if it was not possible to determine statically.

Currently, the subroutine can be identified statically if the RV that the
C<rv2cv> is to operate on is provided by a suitable C<gv> or C<const> op.
A C<gv> op is suitable if the GV's CV slot is populated.  A C<const> op is
suitable if the constant value must be an RV pointing to a CV.  Details of
this process may change in future versions of Perl.  If the C<rv2cv> op
has the C<OPpENTERSUB_AMPER> flag set then no attempt is made to identify
the subroutine statically: this flag is used to suppress compile-time
magic on a subroutine call, forcing it to use default runtime behaviour.

If C<flags> has the bit C<RV2CVOPCV_MARK_EARLY> set, then the handling
of a GV reference is modified.  If a GV was examined and its CV slot was
found to be empty, then the C<gv> op has the C<OPpEARLY_CV> flag set.
If the op is not optimised away, and the CV slot is later populated with
a subroutine having a prototype, that flag eventually triggers the warning
"called too early to check prototype".

If C<flags> has the bit C<RV2CVOPCV_RETURN_NAME_GV> set, then instead
of returning a pointer to the subroutine it returns a pointer to the
GV giving the most appropriate name for the subroutine in this context.
Normally this is just the C<CvGV> of the subroutine, but for an anonymous
(C<CvANON>) subroutine that is referenced through a GV it will be the
referencing GV.  The resulting C<GV*> is cast to C<CV*> to be returned.
A null pointer is returned as usual if there is no statically-determinable
subroutine.

X<unpackstring>

The engine implementing the C<unpack()> Perl function.

Using the template C<pat..patend>, this function unpacks the string
C<s..strend> into a number of mortal SVs, which it pushes onto the perl
argument (C<@_>) stack (so you will need to issue a C<PUTBACK> before and
C<SPAGAIN> after the call to this function).  It returns the number of
pushed elements.

The C<strend> and C<patend> pointers should point to the byte following the
last character of each string.

Although this function returns its values on the perl argument stack, it
doesn't take any parameters from that stack (and thus in particular
there's no need to do a C<PUSHMARK> before calling it, unlike L</call_pv> for
example).

=item CvPADLIST
X<CvPADLIST>


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


CV's can have CvPADLIST(cv) set to point to a PADLIST.  This is the CV's
scratchpad, which stores lexical variables and opcode temporary and
per-thread values.

For these purposes "formats" are a kind-of CV; eval""s are too (except they're
not callable at will and are always thrown away after the eval"" is done
executing).  Require'd files are simply evals without any outer lexical
scope.

XSUBs do not have a C<CvPADLIST>.  C<dXSTARG> fetches values from C<PL_curpad>,
but that is really the callers pad (a slot of which is allocated by
every entersub). Do not get or set C<CvPADLIST> if a CV is an XSUB (as
determined by C<CvISXSUB()>), C<CvPADLIST> slot is reused for a different
internal purpose in XSUBs.

The PADLIST has a C array where pads are stored.

The 0th entry of the PADLIST is a PADNAMELIST
which represents the "names" or rather
the "static type information" for lexicals.  The individual elements of a
PADNAMELIST are PADNAMEs.  Future
refactorings might stop the PADNAMELIST from being stored in the PADLIST's
array, so don't rely on it.  See L</PadlistNAMES>.

The CvDEPTH'th entry of a PADLIST is a PAD (an AV) which is the stack frame
at that depth of recursion into the CV.  The 0th slot of a frame AV is an
AV which is C<@_>.  Other entries are storage for variables and op targets.

Iterating over the PADNAMELIST iterates over all possible pad
items.  Pad slots for targets (C<SVs_PADTMP>)
and GVs end up having &PL_padname_undef "names", while slots for constants 
have C<&PL_padname_const> "names" (see C<L</pad_alloc>>).  That
C<&PL_padname_undef>
and C<&PL_padname_const> are used is an implementation detail subject to
change.  To test for them, use C<!PadnamePV(name)> and
S<C<PadnamePV(name) && !PadnameLEN(name)>>, respectively.

Only C<my>/C<our> variable slots get valid names.
The rest are op targets/GVs/constants which are statically allocated
or resolved at compile time.  These don't have names by which they
can be looked up from Perl code at run time through eval"" the way
C<my>/C<our> variables can be.  Since they can't be looked up by "name"
but only by their index allocated at compile time (which is usually
in C<< PL_op->op_targ >>), wasting a name SV for them doesn't make sense.

The pad names in the PADNAMELIST have their PV holding the name of
the variable.  The C<COP_SEQ_RANGE_LOW> and C<_HIGH> fields form a range
(low+1..high inclusive) of cop_seq numbers for which the name is
valid.  During compilation, these fields may hold the special value
PERL_PADSEQ_INTRO to indicate various stages:

 COP_SEQ_RANGE_LOW        _HIGH
 -----------------        -----
 PERL_PADSEQ_INTRO            0   variable not yet introduced:
                                  { my ($x
 valid-seq#   PERL_PADSEQ_INTRO   variable in scope:
                                  { my ($x);
 valid-seq#          valid-seq#   compilation of scope complete:
                                  { my ($x); .... }

When a lexical var hasn't yet been introduced, it already exists from the
perspective of duplicate declarations, but not for variable lookups, e.g.

    my ($x, $x); # '"my" variable $x masks earlier declaration'
    my $x = $x;  # equal to my $x = $::x;

For typed lexicals C<PadnameTYPE> points at the type stash.  For C<our>
lexicals, C<PadnameOURSTASH> points at the stash of the associated global (so
that duplicate C<our> declarations in the same package can be detected).
C<PadnameGEN> is sometimes used to store the generation number during
compilation.

If C<PadnameOUTER> is set on the pad name, then that slot in the frame AV
is a REFCNT'ed reference to a lexical from "outside".  Such entries
are sometimes referred to as 'fake'.  In this case, the name does not
use 'low' and 'high' to store a cop_seq range, since it is in scope
throughout.  Instead 'high' stores some flags containing info about
the real lexical (is it declared in an anon, and is it capable of being
instantiated multiple times?), and for fake ANONs, 'low' contains the index
within the parent's pad where the lexical's value is stored, to make
cloning quicker.

If the 'name' is C<&> the corresponding entry in the PAD
is a CV representing a possible closure.

Note that formats are treated as anon subs, and are cloned each time
write is called (if necessary).

The flag C<SVs_PADSTALE> is cleared on lexicals each time the C<my()> is executed,
and set on scope exit.  This allows the
C<"Variable $x is not available"> warning
to be generated in evals, such as 

    { my $x = 1; sub f { eval '$x'} } f();

For state vars, C<SVs_PADSTALE> is overloaded to mean 'not yet initialised',
but this internal state is stored in a separate pad entry.

=item PL_peepp
X<PL_peepp>

Pointer to the per-subroutine peephole optimiser.  This is a function

equivalently independent piece of Perl code) to perform fixups of
some ops and to perform small-scale optimisations.  The function is
called once for each subroutine that is compiled, and is passed, as sole
parameter, a pointer to the op that is the entry point to the subroutine.
It modifies the op tree in place.

The peephole optimiser should never be completely replaced.  Rather,
add code to it by wrapping the existing optimiser.  The basic way to do
this can be seen in L<perlguts/Compile pass 3: peephole optimization>.
If the new code wishes to operate on ops throughout the subroutine's
structure, rather than just at the top level, it is likely to be more
convenient to wrap the L</PL_rpeepp> hook.

once for each chain of ops linked through their C<op_next> fields;
it is recursively called to handle each side chain.  It is passed, as
sole parameter, a pointer to the op that is at the head of the chain.
It modifies the op tree in place.

space is allocated.)  The reference count for the new SV is set to 1.

In 5.9.3, C<newSV()> replaces the older C<NEWSV()> API, and drops the first
parameter, I<x>, a debug aid which allowed callers to identify themselves.
This aid has been superseded by a new build option, C<PERL_MEM_LOG> (see

=item newSVpv
X<newSVpv>

Creates a new SV and copies a string (which may contain C<NUL> (C<\0>)
characters) into it.  The reference count for the
SV is set to 1.  If C<len> is zero, Perl will compute the length using
C<strlen()>, (which means if you use this option, that C<s> can't have embedded
C<NUL> characters and has to have a terminating C<NUL> byte).

This function can cause reliability issues if you are likely to pass in
empty strings that are not null terminated, because it will run
strlen on the string and potentially run past valid memory.

Using L</newSVpvn> is a safer alternative for non C<NUL> terminated strings.
For string literals use L</newSVpvs> instead.  This function will work fine for
C<NUL> terminated strings, but if you want to avoid the if statement on whether
to call C<strlen> use C<newSVpvn> instead (calling C<strlen> yourself).

Creates a new SV and copies a string into it, which may contain C<NUL> characters
(C<\0>) and other binary data.  The reference count for the SV is set to 1.
Note that if C<len> is zero, Perl will create a zero length (Perl) string.  You
are responsible for ensuring that the source buffer is at least
C<len> bytes long.  If the C<s> argument is NULL the new SV will be
undefined.

=item newSVpvn_flags
X<newSVpvn_flags>

Creates a new SV and copies a string (which may contain C<NUL> (C<\0>)
characters) into it.  The reference count for the
SV is set to 1.  Note that if C<len> is zero, Perl will create a zero length
string.  You are responsible for ensuring that the source string is at least
C<len> bytes long.  If the C<s> argument is NULL the new SV will be undefined.
Currently the only flag bits accepted are C<SVf_UTF8> and C<SVs_TEMP>.
If C<SVs_TEMP> is set, then C<sv_2mortal()> is called on the result before
returning.  If C<SVf_UTF8> is set, C<s>
is considered to be in UTF-8 and the
C<SVf_UTF8> flag will be set on the new SV.
C<newSVpvn_utf8()> is a convenience wrapper for this function, defined as

=item newSVpvn_share
X<newSVpvn_share>

Creates a new SV with its C<SvPVX_const> pointing to a shared string in the string
table.  If the string does not already exist in the table, it is
created first.  Turns on the C<SvIsCOW> flag (or C<READONLY>
and C<FAKE> in 5.16 and earlier).  If the C<hash> parameter
is non-zero, that value is used; otherwise the hash is computed.
The string's hash can later be retrieved from the SV
with the C<SvSHARED_HASH()> macro.  The idea here is
that as the string table is used for shared hash keys these strings will have
C<SvPVX_const == HeKEY> and hash lookup will avoid string compare.

=item sv_chop
X<sv_chop>

Efficient removal of characters from the beginning of the string buffer.
C<SvPOK(sv)>, or at least C<SvPOKp(sv)>, must be true and C<ptr> must be a
pointer to somewhere inside the string buffer.  C<ptr> becomes the first
character of the adjusted string.  Uses the C<OOK> hack.  On return, only
C<SvPOK(sv)> and C<SvPOKp(sv)> among the C<OK> flags will be true.

Beware: after this function returns, C<ptr> and SvPVX_const(sv) may no longer
refer to the same chunk of data.

The unfortunate similarity of this function's name to that of Perl's C<chop>
operator is strictly coincidental.  This function works from the left;
C<chop> works from the right.

Clear an SV: call any destructors, free up any memory used by the body,
and free the body itself.  The SV's head is I<not> freed, although
its type is set to all 1's so that it won't inadvertently be assumed
to be live during global destruction etc.
This function should only be called when C<REFCNT> is zero.  Most of the time

=item sv_force_normal_flags

Undo various types of fakery on an SV, where fakery means
"more than" a string: if the PV is a shared string, make
a private copy; if we're a ref, stop refing; if we're a glob, downgrade to
an C<xpvmg>; if we're a copy-on-write scalar, this is the on-write time when
we do the copy, and is also used locally; if this is a
vstring, drop the vstring magic.  If C<SV_COW_DROP_PV> is set
then a copy-on-write scalar drops its PV buffer (if any) and becomes
C<SvPOK_off> rather than making a copy.  (Used where this
scalar is about to be set to some other value.)  In addition,
the C<flags> parameter gets passed to C<sv_unref_flags()>
when unreffing.  C<sv_force_normal> calls this function
with flags set to 0.

This function is expected to be used to signal to perl that this SV is
about to be written to, and any extra book-keeping needs to be taken care
of.  Hence, it croaks on read-only values.

=item sv_usepvn_flags
X<sv_usepvn_flags>

Tells an SV to use C<ptr> to find its string value.  Normally the
string is stored inside the SV, but sv_usepvn allows the SV to use an
outside string.  C<ptr> should point to memory that was allocated
by L<C<Newx>|perlclib/Memory Management and String Handling>.  It must be
the start of a C<Newx>-ed block of memory, and not a pointer to the
middle of it (beware of L<C<OOK>|perlguts/Offsets> and copy-on-write),
and not be from a non-C<Newx> memory allocator like C<malloc>.  The
string length, C<len>, must be supplied.  By default this function
will C<Renew> (i.e. realloc, move) the memory pointed to by C<ptr>,
so that pointer should not be freed or used by the programmer after
giving it to C<sv_usepvn>, and neither should any pointers from "behind"
that pointer (e.g. ptr + 1) be used.

If S<C<flags & SV_SMAGIC>> is true, will call C<SvSETMAGIC>.  If
S<C<flags & SV_HAS_TRAILING_NUL>> is true, then C<ptr[len]> must be C<NUL>,
and the realloc
will be skipped (i.e. the buffer is actually at least 1 byte longer than
C<len>, and already meets the requirements for storing in C<SvPVX>).

Processes its arguments like C<vsprintf> and appends the formatted output

missing (C<NULL>). Argument reordering (using format specifiers like C<%2$d>
or C<%*2$d>) is supported only when using an array of SVs; using a C-style
C<va_list> argument list with a format string that uses argument reordering
will yield an exception.

When running with taint checks enabled, indicates via
C<maybe_tainted> if results are untrustworthy (often due to the use of
locales).

If called as C<sv_vcatpvfn> or flags has the C<SV_GMAGIC> bit set, calls get magic.

X<svtype>

An enum of flags for Perl types.  These are found in the file F<sv.h>
in the C<svtype> enum.  Test these flags with the C<SvTYPE> macro.

The types are:

    SVt_NULL
    SVt_IV
    SVt_NV
    SVt_RV
    SVt_PV
    SVt_PVIV
    SVt_PVNV
    SVt_PVMG
    SVt_INVLIST
    SVt_REGEXP
    SVt_PVGV
    SVt_PVLV
    SVt_PVAV
    SVt_PVHV
    SVt_PVCV
    SVt_PVFM
    SVt_PVIO

These are most easily explained from the bottom up.

C<SVt_PVIO> is for I/O objects, C<SVt_PVFM> for formats, C<SVt_PVCV> for
subroutines, C<SVt_PVHV> for hashes and C<SVt_PVAV> for arrays.

All the others are scalar types, that is, things that can be bound to a
C<$> variable.  For these, the internal types are mostly orthogonal to
types in the Perl language.

Hence, checking C<< SvTYPE(sv) < SVt_PVAV >> is the best way to see whether
something is a scalar.

C<SVt_PVGV> represents a typeglob.  If C<!SvFAKE(sv)>, then it is a real,
incoercible typeglob.  If C<SvFAKE(sv)>, then it is a scalar to which a
typeglob has been assigned.  Assigning to it again will stop it from being
a typeglob.  C<SVt_PVLV> represents a scalar that delegates to another scalar
behind the scenes.  It is used, e.g., for the return value of C<substr> and
for tied hash and array elements.  It can hold any scalar value, including
a typeglob.  C<SVt_REGEXP> is for regular
expressions.  C<SVt_INVLIST> is for Perl
core internal use only.

C<SVt_PVMG> represents a "normal" scalar (not a typeglob, regular expression,
or delegate).  Since most scalars do not need all the internal fields of a
PVMG, we save memory by allocating smaller structs when possible.  All the
other types are just simpler forms of C<SVt_PVMG>, with fewer internal fields.
C<SVt_NULL> can only hold undef.  C<SVt_IV> can hold undef, an integer, or a

Note that there is no guarantee that the return value of C<SvPV()> is
equal to C<SvPVX(sv)>, or that C<SvPVX(sv)> contains valid data, or that
successive calls to C<SvPV(sv)> will return the same pointer value each
time.  This is due to the way that things like overloading and
Copy-On-Write are handled.  In these cases, the return value may point to
a temporary buffer or similar.  If you absolutely need the C<SvPVX> field to
be valid (for example, if you intend to write to it), then see

=item BOM_UTF8
X<BOM_UTF8>

This is a macro that evaluates to a string constant of the  UTF-8 bytes that
define the Unicode BYTE ORDER MARK (U+FEFF) for the platform that perl
is compiled on.  This allows code to use a mnemonic for this character that
works on both ASCII and EBCDIC platforms.

equal, -1 or -2 if the first string is less than the second string, +1 or +2
if the first string is greater than the second string.

-1 or +1 is returned if the shorter string was identical to the start of the
longer string.  -2 or +2 is returned if
there was a difference between characters
within the strings.

=item bytes_from_utf8
X<bytes_from_utf8>


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


Converts a potentially UTF-8 encoded string C<s> of length C<*lenp> into native
byte encoding.  On input, the boolean C<*is_utf8p> gives whether or not C<s> is
actually encoded in UTF-8.

Unlike L</utf8_to_bytes> but like L</bytes_to_utf8>, this is non-destructive of
the input string.

Do nothing if C<*is_utf8p> is 0, or if there are code points in the string
not expressible in native byte encoding.  In these cases, C<*is_utf8p> and
C<*lenp> are unchanged, and the return value is the original C<s>.

Otherwise, C<*is_utf8p> is set to 0, and the return value is a pointer to a
newly created string containing a downgraded copy of C<s>, and whose length is
returned in C<*lenp>, updated.  The new string is C<NUL>-terminated.  The
caller is responsible for arranging for the memory used by this string to get
freed.

Upon successful return, the number of variants in the string can be computed by
having saved the value of C<*lenp> before the call, and subtracting the
after-call value of C<*lenp> from it.

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be

Converts a string C<s> of length C<*lenp> bytes from the native encoding into
UTF-8.
Returns a pointer to the newly-created string, and sets C<*lenp> to
reflect the new length in bytes.  The caller is responsible for arranging for
the memory used by this string to get freed.

Upon successful return, the number of variants in the string can be computed by
having saved the value of C<*lenp> before the call, and subtracting it from the
after-call value of C<*lenp>.

A C<NUL> character will be written after the end of the string.

=item foldEQ_utf8
X<foldEQ_utf8>

Returns true if the leading portions of the strings C<s1> and C<s2> (either or
both of which may be in UTF-8) are the same case-insensitively; false
otherwise.  How far into the strings to compare is determined by other input
parameters.

If C<u1> is true, the string C<s1> is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode;
otherwise it is assumed to be in native 8-bit encoding.  Correspondingly for
C<u2> with respect to C<s2>.

If the byte length C<l1> is non-zero, it says how far into C<s1> to check for
fold equality.  In other words, C<s1>+C<l1> will be used as a goal to reach.
The scan will not be considered to be a match unless the goal is reached, and
scanning won't continue past that goal.  Correspondingly for C<l2> with respect
to C<s2>.

If C<pe1> is non-C<NULL> and the pointer it points to is not C<NULL>, that
pointer is considered an end pointer to the position 1 byte past the maximum
point in C<s1> beyond which scanning will not continue under any circumstances.
(This routine assumes that UTF-8 encoded input strings are not malformed;
malformed input can cause it to read past C<pe1>).  This means that if both
C<l1> and C<pe1> are specified, and C<pe1> is less than C<s1>+C<l1>, the match
will never be successful because it can never
get as far as its goal (and in fact is asserted against).  Correspondingly for
C<pe2> with respect to C<s2>.

At least one of C<s1> and C<s2> must have a goal (at least one of C<l1> and
C<l2> must be non-zero), and if both do, both have to be
reached for a successful match.   Also, if the fold of a character is multiple
characters, all of them must be matched (see tr21 reference below for
'folding').

Upon a successful match, if C<pe1> is non-C<NULL>,
it will be set to point to the beginning of the I<next> character of C<s1>
beyond what was matched.  Correspondingly for C<pe2> and C<s2>.

For case-insensitiveness, the "casefolding" of Unicode is used
instead of upper/lowercasing both the characters, see

L<Unicode Corrigendum #9|http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html>;
otherwise it returns FALSE.  If C<len> is 0, it will be calculated using
C<strlen(s)> (which means if you use this option, that C<s> can't have embedded
C<NUL> characters and has to have a terminating C<NUL> byte).  Note that all
characters being ASCII constitute 'a valid UTF-8 string'.

This function returns FALSE for strings containing any code points above the

Returns TRUE if the first C<len> bytes of string C<s> form a valid
UTF-8-encoded string that is fully interchangeable by any application using
Unicode rules; otherwise it returns FALSE.  If C<len> is 0, it will be
calculated using C<strlen(s)> (which means if you use this option, that C<s>
can't have embedded C<NUL> characters and has to have a terminating C<NUL>
byte).  Note that all characters being ASCII constitute 'a valid UTF-8 string'.

This function returns FALSE for strings containing any
code points above the Unicode max of 0x10FFFF, surrogate code points, or
non-character code points.

X<is_utf8_valid_partial_char>

Returns 0 if the sequence of bytes starting at C<s> and looking no further than
S<C<e - 1>> is the UTF-8 encoding, as extended by Perl, for one or more code
points.  Otherwise, it returns 1 if there exists at least one non-empty
sequence of bytes that when appended to sequence C<s>, starting at position
C<e> causes the entire sequence to be the well-formed UTF-8 of some code point;
otherwise returns 0.

In other words this returns TRUE if C<s> points to a partial UTF-8-encoded code
point.

This is useful when a fixed-length buffer is being tested for being well-formed
UTF-8, but the final few bytes in it don't comprise a full character; that is,
it is split somewhere in the middle of the final code point's UTF-8
representation.  (Presumably when the buffer is refreshed with the next chunk
of data, the new first bytes will complete the partial code point.)   This
function is used to verify that the final bytes in the current buffer are in
fact the legal beginning of some code point, so that if they aren't, the
failure can be signalled without having to wait for the next read.

there is any sequence of bytes that can complete the input partial character in
such a way that a non-prohibited character is formed, the function returns
TRUE; otherwise FALSE.  Non character code points cannot be determined based on
partial character input.  But many  of the other possible excluded types can be
determined from just the first one or two bytes.

Evaluates to non-zero if the first few bytes of the string starting at C<s> and
looking no further than S<C<e - 1>> are well-formed UTF-8, as extended by Perl,
that represents some code point; otherwise it evaluates to 0.  If non-zero, the
value gives how many bytes starting at C<s> comprise the code point's
representation.  Any bytes remaining before C<e>, but beyond the ones needed to
form the first code point in C<s>, are not examined.

The code point can be any that will fit in a UV on this machine, using Perl's
extension to official UTF-8 to represent those higher than the Unicode maximum
of 0x10FFFF.  That means that this macro is used to efficiently decide if the
next few bytes in C<s> is legal UTF-8 for a single character.

Use C<L</isSTRICT_UTF8_CHAR>> to restrict the acceptable code points to those
defined by Unicode to be fully interchangeable across applications;
C<L</isC9_STRICT_UTF8_CHAR>> to use the L<Unicode Corrigendum
#9|http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html> definition of allowable

Note that it is deprecated to use code points higher than what will fit in an
IV.  This macro does not raise any warnings for such code points, treating them
as valid.

Note also that a UTF-8 INVARIANT character (i.e. ASCII on non-EBCDIC machines)

causes zero to be returned and C<*retlen> is set so that (S<C<s> + C<*retlen>>)
is the next possible position in C<s> that could begin a non-malformed
character.  Also, if UTF-8 warnings haven't been lexically disabled, a warning
is raised.  Some UTF-8 input sequences may contain multiple malformations.
This function tries to find every possible one in each call, so multiple
warnings can be raised for the same sequence.

Various ALLOW flags can be set in C<flags> to allow (and not warn on)
individual types of malformations, such as the sequence being overlong (that
is, when there is a shorter sequence that can express the same code point;
overlong sequences are expressly forbidden in the UTF-8 standard due to
potential security issues).  Another malformation example is the first byte of
a character not being a legal first byte.  See F<utf8.h> for the list of such
flags.  Even if allowed, this function generally returns the Unicode
REPLACEMENT CHARACTER when it encounters a malformation.  There are flags in
F<utf8.h> to override this behavior for the overlong malformations, but don't
do that except for very specialized purposes.

The C<UTF8_CHECK_ONLY> flag overrides the behavior when a non-allowed (by other
flags) malformation is found.  If this flag is set, the routine assumes that
the caller will raise a warning, and this function will silently just set
C<retlen> to C<-1> (cast to C<STRLEN>) and return zero.

Note that this API requires disambiguation between successful decoding a C<NUL>
character, and an error return (unless the C<UTF8_CHECK_ONLY> flag is set), as
in both cases, 0 is returned, and, depending on the malformation, C<retlen> may
be set to 1.  To disambiguate, upon a zero return, see if the first byte of
C<s> is 0 as well.  If so, the input was a C<NUL>; if not, the input had an
error.  Or you can use C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr_error>>.

Certain code points are considered problematic.  These are Unicode surrogates,
Unicode non-characters, and code points above the Unicode maximum of 0x10FFFF.
By default these are considered regular code points, but certain situations
warrant special handling for them, which can be specified using the C<flags>
parameter.  If C<flags> contains C<UTF8_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE>, all
three classes are treated as malformations and handled as such.  The flags
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_SURROGATE>, C<UTF8_DISALLOW_NONCHAR>, and
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER> (meaning above the legal Unicode maximum) can be set to
disallow these categories individually.  C<UTF8_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE>
restricts the allowed inputs to the strict UTF-8 traditionally defined by
Unicode.  Use C<UTF8_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE> to use the strictness
definition given by
L<Unicode Corrigendum #9|http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html>.
The difference between traditional strictness and C9 strictness is that the
latter does not forbid non-character code points.  (They are still discouraged,
however.)  For more discussion see L<perlunicode/Noncharacter code points>.

The flags C<UTF8_WARN_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE>,
C<UTF8_WARN_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE>, C<UTF8_WARN_SURROGATE>,
C<UTF8_WARN_NONCHAR>, and C<UTF8_WARN_SUPER> will cause warning messages to be
raised for their respective categories, but otherwise the code points are
considered valid (not malformations).  To get a category to both be treated as
a malformation and raise a warning, specify both the WARN and DISALLOW flags.
(But note that warnings are not raised if lexically disabled nor if
C<UTF8_CHECK_ONLY> is also specified.)

Extremely high code points were never specified in any standard, and require an
extension to UTF-8 to express, which Perl does.  It is likely that programs
written in something other than Perl would not be able to read files that
contain these; nor would Perl understand files written by something that uses a
different extension.  For these reasons, there is a separate set of flags that
can warn and/or disallow these extremely high code points, even if other
above-Unicode ones are accepted.  They are the C<UTF8_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED> and
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED> flags.  For more information see
L</C<UTF8_GOT_PERL_EXTENDED>>.  Of course C<UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER> will treat all
above-Unicode code points, including these, as malformations.
(Note that the Unicode standard considers anything above 0x10FFFF to be
illegal, but there are standards predating it that allow up to 0x7FFF_FFFF
(2**31 -1))

A somewhat misleadingly named synonym for C<UTF8_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED> is
retained for backward compatibility: C<UTF8_WARN_ABOVE_31_BIT>.  Similarly,
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_ABOVE_31_BIT> is usable instead of the more accurately named
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED>.  The names are misleading because these flags
can apply to code points that actually do fit in 31 bits.  This happens on
EBCDIC platforms, and sometimes when the L<overlong
malformation|/C<UTF8_GOT_LONG>> is also present.  The new names accurately
describe the situation in all cases.


All other code points corresponding to Unicode characters, including private
use and those yet to be assigned, are never considered malformed and never
warn.

=item utf8n_to_uvchr_error
X<utf8n_to_uvchr_error>

THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.
Most code should use L</utf8_to_uvchr_buf>() rather than call this directly.

This function is for code that needs to know what the precise malformation(s)
are when an error is found.  If you also need to know the generated warning
messages, use L</utf8n_to_uvchr_msgs>() instead.

It is like C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr>> but it takes an extra parameter placed after
all the others, C<errors>.  If this parameter is 0, this function behaves
identically to C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr>>.  Otherwise, C<errors> should be a pointer
to a C<U32> variable, which this function sets to indicate any errors found.
Upon return, if C<*errors> is 0, there were no errors found.  Otherwise,
C<*errors> is the bit-wise C<OR> of the bits described in the list below.  Some
of these bits will be set if a malformation is found, even if the input
C<flags> parameter indicates that the given malformation is allowed; those
exceptions are noted:

=over 4

=item C<UTF8_GOT_PERL_EXTENDED>

The input sequence is not standard UTF-8, but a Perl extension.  This bit is
set only if the input C<flags> parameter contains either the
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED> or the C<UTF8_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED> flags.

Code points above 0x7FFF_FFFF (2**31 - 1) were never specified in any standard,
and so some extension must be used to express them.  Perl uses a natural
extension to UTF-8 to represent the ones up to 2**36-1, and invented a further
extension to represent even higher ones, so that any code point that fits in a
64-bit word can be represented.  Text using these extensions is not likely to
be portable to non-Perl code.  We lump both of these extensions together and
refer to them as Perl extended UTF-8.  There exist other extensions that people
have invented, incompatible with Perl's.

On EBCDIC platforms starting in Perl v5.24, the Perl extension for representing
extremely high code points kicks in at 0x3FFF_FFFF (2**30 -1), which is lower
than on ASCII.  Prior to that, code points 2**31 and higher were simply
unrepresentable, and a different, incompatible method was used to represent
code points between 2**30 and 2**31 - 1.

On both platforms, ASCII and EBCDIC, C<UTF8_GOT_PERL_EXTENDED> is set if
Perl extended UTF-8 is used.

In earlier Perls, this bit was named C<UTF8_GOT_ABOVE_31_BIT>, which you still
may use for backward compatibility.  That name is misleading, as this flag may
be set when the code point actually does fit in 31 bits.  This happens on
EBCDIC platforms, and sometimes when the L<overlong
malformation|/C<UTF8_GOT_LONG>> is also present.  The new name accurately
describes the situation in all cases.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_CONTINUATION>

The input sequence was malformed in that the first byte was a a UTF-8
continuation byte.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_EMPTY>

The input C<curlen> parameter was 0.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_LONG>

The input sequence was malformed in that there is some other sequence that
evaluates to the same code point, but that sequence is shorter than this one.

Until Unicode 3.1, it was legal for programs to accept this malformation, but
it was discovered that this created security issues.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_NONCHAR>

The code point represented by the input UTF-8 sequence is for a Unicode
non-character code point.
This bit is set only if the input C<flags> parameter contains either the
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_NONCHAR> or the C<UTF8_WARN_NONCHAR> flags.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_NON_CONTINUATION>

The input sequence was malformed in that a non-continuation type byte was found
in a position where only a continuation type one should be.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_OVERFLOW>

The input sequence was malformed in that it is for a code point that is not
representable in the number of bits available in an IV on the current platform.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_SHORT>

The input sequence was malformed in that C<curlen> is smaller than required for
a complete sequence.  In other words, the input is for a partial character
sequence.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_SUPER>

The input sequence was malformed in that it is for a non-Unicode code point;
that is, one above the legal Unicode maximum.
This bit is set only if the input C<flags> parameter contains either the
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER> or the C<UTF8_WARN_SUPER> flags.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_SURROGATE>

The input sequence was malformed in that it is for a -Unicode UTF-16 surrogate

THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.
Most code should use L</utf8_to_uvchr_buf>() rather than call this directly.

This function is for code that needs to know what the precise malformation(s)
are when an error is found, and wants the corresponding warning and/or error
messages to be returned to the caller rather than be displayed.  All messages
that would have been displayed if all lexcial warnings are enabled will be
returned.

It is just like C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr_error>> but it takes an extra parameter
placed after all the others, C<msgs>.  If this parameter is 0, this function
behaves identically to C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr_error>>.  Otherwise, C<msgs> should
be a pointer to an C<AV *> variable, in which this function creates a new AV to
contain any appropriate messages.  The elements of the array are ordered so
that the first message that would have been displayed is in the 0th element,
and so on.  Each element is a hash with three key-value pairs, as follows:

=over 4

=item C<text>

The text of the message as a C<SVpv>.

=item C<warn_categories>

The warning category (or categories) packed into a C<SVuv>.

=item C<flag>

A single flag bit associated with this message, in a C<SVuv>.
The bit corresponds to some bit in the C<*errors> return value,
such as C<UTF8_GOT_LONG>.

=back

It's important to note that specifying this parameter as non-null will cause
any warnings this function would otherwise generate to be suppressed, and
instead be placed in C<*msgs>.  The caller can check the lexical warnings state
(or not) when choosing what to do with the returned messages.

If the flag C<UTF8_CHECK_ONLY> is passed, no warnings are generated, and hence
no AV is created.

The caller, of course, is responsible for freeing any returned AV.

0 is returned if the bytes are not well-formed extended UTF-8, or if they

If C<flags> is 0, this function accepts any code point from 0..C<IV_MAX> as
input.  C<IV_MAX> is typically 0x7FFF_FFFF in a 32-bit word.

Specifying C<flags> can further restrict what is allowed and not warned on, as
follows:

If C<uv> is a Unicode surrogate code point and C<UNICODE_WARN_SURROGATE> is set,
the function will raise a warning, provided UTF8 warnings are enabled.  If
instead C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_SURROGATE> is set, the function will fail and return
NULL.  If both flags are set, the function will both warn and return NULL.

Similarly, the C<UNICODE_WARN_NONCHAR> and C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_NONCHAR> flags
affect how the function handles a Unicode non-character.

And likewise, the C<UNICODE_WARN_SUPER> and C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_SUPER> flags
affect the handling of code points that are above the Unicode maximum of
0x10FFFF.  Languages other than Perl may not be able to accept files that
contain these.

The flag C<UNICODE_WARN_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE> selects all three of
the above WARN flags; and C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE> selects all
three DISALLOW flags.  C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE> restricts the
allowed inputs to the strict UTF-8 traditionally defined by Unicode.
Similarly, C<UNICODE_WARN_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE> and
C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE> are shortcuts to select the
above-Unicode and surrogate flags, but not the non-character ones, as
defined in
L<Unicode Corrigendum #9|http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html>.
See L<perlunicode/Noncharacter code points>.

Extremely high code points were never specified in any standard, and require an
extension to UTF-8 to express, which Perl does.  It is likely that programs
written in something other than Perl would not be able to read files that
contain these; nor would Perl understand files written by something that uses a
different extension.  For these reasons, there is a separate set of flags that
can warn and/or disallow these extremely high code points, even if other
above-Unicode ones are accepted.  They are the C<UNICODE_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED>
and C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED> flags.  For more information see
L</C<UTF8_GOT_PERL_EXTENDED>>.  Of course C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_SUPER> will
treat all above-Unicode code points, including these, as malformations.  (Note
that the Unicode standard considers anything above 0x10FFFF to be illegal, but
there are standards predating it that allow up to 0x7FFF_FFFF (2**31 -1))

A somewhat misleadingly named synonym for C<UNICODE_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED> is
retained for backward compatibility: C<UNICODE_WARN_ABOVE_31_BIT>.  Similarly,
C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_ABOVE_31_BIT> is usable instead of the more accurately named
C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED>.  The names are misleading because on EBCDIC
platforms,these flags can apply to code points that actually do fit in 31 bits.
The new names accurately describe the situation in all cases.

X<uvchr_to_utf8_flags_msgs>


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.

Most code should use C<L</uvchr_to_utf8_flags>()> rather than call this directly.

This function is for code that wants any warning and/or error messages to be
returned to the caller rather than be displayed.  All messages that would have
been displayed if all lexcial warnings are enabled will be returned.

It is just like C<L</uvchr_to_utf8_flags>> but it takes an extra parameter
placed after all the others, C<msgs>.  If this parameter is 0, this function
behaves identically to C<L</uvchr_to_utf8_flags>>.  Otherwise, C<msgs> should
be a pointer to an C<HV *> variable, in which this function creates a new HV to
contain any appropriate messages.  The hash has three key-value pairs, as
follows:

=over 4

=item C<text>

The text of the message as a C<SVpv>.

=item C<warn_categories>

The warning category (or categories) packed into a C<SVuv>.

=item C<flag>

A single flag bit associated with this message, in a C<SVuv>.
The bit corresponds to some bit in the C<*errors> return value,
such as C<UNICODE_GOT_SURROGATE>.

=back

It's important to note that specifying this parameter as non-null will cause
any warnings this function would otherwise generate to be suppressed, and
instead be placed in C<*msgs>.  The caller can check the lexical warnings state
(or not) when choosing what to do with the returned messages.

The caller, of course, is responsible for freeing any returned HV.

THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.
Instead, B<Almost all code should use L</uvchr_to_utf8> or
L</uvchr_to_utf8_flags>>.

This function is like them, but the input is a strict Unicode
(as opposed to native) code point.  Only in very rare circumstances should code
not be using the native code point.

For details, see the description for L</uvchr_to_utf8_flags>.

This function is a deprecated synonym for L</uvoffuni_to_utf8_flags>,
which itself, while not deprecated, should be used only in isolated
circumstances.  These functions were useful for code that wanted to handle
both EBCDIC and ASCII platforms with Unicode properties, but starting in Perl
v5.20, the distinctions between the platforms have mostly been made invisible
to most code, so this function is quite unlikely to be what you want.

the next character in the input UTF-8 string C<s> is well-formed (I<e.g.>,
it passes C<L</isUTF8_CHAR>>.  Surrogates, non-character code points, and
non-Unicode code points are allowed.

This is an XS interface to Perl's C<die> function.

Take a sprintf-style format pattern and argument list.  These are used to
generate a string message.  If the message does not end with a newline,
then it will be extended with some indication of the current location
in the code, as described for L</mess_sv>.

The error message will be used as an exception, by default
returning control to the nearest enclosing C<eval>, but subject to
modification by a C<$SIG{__DIE__}> handler.  In any case, the C<croak>
function never returns normally.

For historical reasons, if C<pat> is null then the contents of C<ERRSV>
(C<$@>) will be used as an error message or object instead of building an
error message from arguments.  If you want to throw a non-string object,
or build an error message in an SV yourself, it is preferable to use
