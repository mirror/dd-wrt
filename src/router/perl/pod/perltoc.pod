=item Simple word matching

=item Using character classes

=item Matching this or that

=item Grouping things and hierarchical matching

Z<>0. Start with the first letter in the string C<'a'>, Z<>1. Try the first
alternative in the first group C<'abd'>, Z<>2.	Match C<'a'> followed by
C<'b'>. So far so good, Z<>3.  C<'d'> in the regexp doesn't match C<'c'> in
the string - a dead end.  So backtrack two characters and pick the second
alternative in the first group C<'abc'>, Z<>4.	Match C<'a'> followed by
C<'b'> followed by C<'c'>.  We are on a roll and have satisfied the first
group. Set C<$1> to C<'abc'>, Z<>5 Move on to the second group and pick the
first alternative C<'df'>, Z<>6 Match the C<'d'>, Z<>7.  C<'f'> in the
regexp doesn't match C<'e'> in the string, so a dead end.  Backtrack one
character and pick the second alternative in the second group C<'d'>, Z<>8.
 C<'d'> matches. The second grouping is satisfied, so set C<$2> to C<'d'>,
Z<>9.  We are at the end of the regexp, so we are done! We have matched
C<'abcd'> out of the string C<"abcde">

=item Extracting matches

=item Backreferences

=item Relative backreferences

=item Named backreferences

=item Alternative capture group numbering

=item Position information

=item Non-capturing groupings

=item Matching repetitions

Z<>0.  Start with the first letter in the string C<'t'>, Z<>1.	The first
quantifier C<'.*'> starts out by matching the whole string "C<the cat in
the hat>", Z<>2.  C<'a'> in the regexp element C<'at'> doesn't match the
end of the string.  Backtrack one character, Z<>3.  C<'a'> in the regexp
element C<'at'> still doesn't match the last letter of the string C<'t'>,
so backtrack one more character, Z<>4.	Now we can match the C<'a'> and the
C<'t'>, Z<>5.  Move on to the third element C<'.*'>.  Since we are at the
end of the string and C<'.*'> can match 0 times, assign it the empty
string, Z<>6.  We are done!

=over 4

=item DESCRIPTION

=over 4

=item Important Caveats

Safest if you C<use feature 'unicode_strings'>, Input and Output Layers,
You must convert your non-ASCII, non-UTF-8 Perl scripts to be UTF-8, C<use
utf8> still needed to enable L<UTF-8|/Unicode Encodings> in scripts,
L<UTF-16|/Unicode Encodings> scripts autodetected

=item Byte and Character Semantics

=item ASCII Rules versus Unicode Rules

When the string has been upgraded to UTF-8, There are additional methods
for regular expression patterns

=item Extended Grapheme Clusters (Logical characters)

=item Unicode Character Properties

B<C<\p{All}>>, B<C<\p{Alnum}>>, B<C<\p{Any}>>, B<C<\p{ASCII}>>,
B<C<\p{Assigned}>>, B<C<\p{Blank}>>, B<C<\p{Decomposition_Type:
Non_Canonical}>>    (Short: C<\p{Dt=NonCanon}>), B<C<\p{Graph}>>,

B<C<\p{Word}>>, B<C<\p{XPosix...}>>

=item User-Defined Character Properties

=item User-Defined Case Mappings (for serious hackers only)

=item Character Encodings for Input and Output

=item Unicode Regular Expression Support Level

[1] C<\N{U+...}> and C<\x{...}>, [2] C<\p{...}> C<\P{...}>.  This
requirement is for a minimal list of properties.  Perl supports these and
all other Unicode character properties, as R2.7 asks (see L</"Unicode
Character Properties"> above), [3] Perl has C<\d> C<\D> C<\s> C<\S> C<\w>
C<\W> C<\X> C<[:I<prop>:]> C<[:^I<prop>:]>, plus all the properties
specified by
L<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Compatibility_Properties>.  These
are described above in L</Other Properties>, [4], Regular expression
lookahead, [5] C<\b> C<\B> meet most, but not all, the details of this
requirement, but C<\b{wb}> and C<\B{wb}> do, as well as the stricter R2.3,
[6], [7], [8] UTF-8/UTF-EBDDIC used in Perl allows not only C<U+10000> to
C<U+10FFFF> but also beyond C<U+10FFFF>, [9] Unicode has rewritten this
portion of UTS#18 to say that getting canonical equivalence (see UAX#15
L<"Unicode Normalization Forms"|http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15>) is
basically to be done at the programmer level.  Use NFD to write both your
regular expressions and text to match them against (you can use
L<Unicode::Normalize>), [10] Perl has C<\X> and C<\b{gcb}> but we don't
have a "Grapheme Cluster Mode", [11] see L<UAX#29 "Unicode Text
Segmentation"|http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29>,, [12] Perl has
L<Unicode::Collate>, but it isn't integrated with regular expressions.	See
L<UTS#10 "Unicode Collation
Algorithms"|http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10>, [13] Perl has C<(?<=x)>
and C<(?=x)>, but lookaheads or lookbehinds should see outside of the
target substring

=item FAQ

What's the minimum perl version required to run Archive::Tar?, Isn't
Archive::Tar slow?, Isn't Archive::Tar heavier on memory than /bin/tar?,
Can you lazy-load data instead?, How much memory will an X kb tar file
need?, What do you do with unsupported filetypes in an archive?, I'm using
WinZip, or some other non-POSIX client, and files are not being extracted
properly!, How do I extract only files that have property X from an
archive?, How do I access .tar.Z files?, How do I handle Unicode strings?

=item CAVEATS

=item TODO

Check if passed in handles are open for read/write, Allow archives to be
passed in as string, Facilitate processing an opened filehandle of a
compressed archive

=head2 ExtUtils::MakeMaker::FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions About
MakeMaker

=over 4

=item DESCRIPTION

=over 4

=item Module Installation

How do I install a module into my home directory?, How do I get MakeMaker
and Module::Build to install to the same place?, How do I keep from
installing man pages?, How do I use a module without installing it?, How
can I organize tests into subdirectories and have them run?, PREFIX vs
INSTALL_BASE from Module::Build::Cookbook, Generating *.pm files with
substitutions eg of $VERSION

=item Common errors and problems

"No rule to make target `/usr/lib/perl5/CORE/config.h', needed by
`Makefile'"

=item Philosophy and History

Why not just use <insert other build config tool here>?, What is
Module::Build and how does it relate to MakeMaker?, pure perl.	no make, no
shell commands, easier to customize, cleaner internals, less cruft

=item Module Writing

How do I keep my $VERSION up to date without resetting it manually?, What's
this F<META.yml> thing and how did it get in my F<MANIFEST>?!, How do I
delete everything not in my F<MANIFEST>?, Which tar should I use on
Windows?, Which zip should I use on Windows for '[ndg]make zipdist'?

=item XS

How do I prevent "object version X.XX does not match bootstrap parameter
Y.YY" errors?, How do I make two or more XS files coexist in the same
directory?, XSMULTI, Separate directories, Bootstrapping

Call Pod::Perldoc::GetOptsOO::getopts($object, \@ARGV, $truth), Given -n,
if there's a opt_n_with, it'll call $object->opt_n_with( ARGUMENT )   
(e.g., "-n foo" => $object->opt_n_with('foo').	Ditto "-nfoo"), Otherwise
(given -n) if there's an opt_n, we'll call it $object->opt_n($truth)   
(Truth defaults to 1), Otherwise we try calling
$object->handle_unknown_option('n')    (and we increment the error count by
the return value of it), If there's no handle_unknown_option, then we just
warn, and then increment    the error counter

=item Rules data structure

By default, all tests are eligible to be run in parallel. Specifying any of
your own rules removes this one, "First match wins". The first rule that
matches a test will be the one that applies, Any test which does not match
a rule will be run in sequence at the end of the run, The existence of a
rule does not imply selecting a test. You must still specify the tests to
run, Specifying a rule to allow tests to run in parallel does not make the
run in parallel. You still need specify the number of parallel C<jobs> in
your Harness object
