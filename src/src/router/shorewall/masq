# Shorewall 1.4 - Masquerade file
#
# /etc/shorewall/masq
#
# Use this file to define dynamic NAT (Masquerading) and to define Source NAT
# (SNAT).
#
# Columns are:
#
#	INTERFACE -- Outgoing interface. This is usually your internet
#		     interface. If ADD_SNAT_ALIASES=Yes in
#		     /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf, you may add ":" and
#		     a digit to indicate that you want the alias added with
#                    that name (e.g., eth0:0). This will allow the alias to
#		     be displayed with ifconfig. THAT IS THE ONLY USE FOR
#		     THE ALIAS NAME AND IT MAY NOT APPEAR IN ANY OTHER
#		     PLACE IN YOUR SHOREWALL CONFIGURATION.
#
#		     This may be qualified by adding the character
#                    ":" followed by a destination host or subnet.
#
#
#	SUBNET -- Subnet that you wish to masquerade. You can specify this as
#		  a subnet or as an interface. If you give the name of an
#		  interface, you must have iproute installed and the interface
#		  must be up before you start the firewall.
#
#		  In order to exclude a subset of the specified SUBNET, you
#		  may append "!" and a comma-separated list of IP addresses
#		  and/or subnets that you wish to exclude.
#
#		  Example: eth1!192.168.1.4,192.168.32.0/27
#
#		  In that example traffic from eth1 would be masqueraded unless
#		  it came from 192.168.1.4 or 196.168.32.0/27
#
#	ADDRESS -- (Optional).  If you specify an address here, SNAT will be
#				used and this will be the source address. If
#				ADD_SNAT_ALIASES is set to Yes or yes in
#				/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf then Shorewall
#				will automatically add this address to the
#				INTERFACE named in the first column.
#
#				You may also specify a range of up to 256
#				IP addresses if you want the SNAT address to
#				be assigned from that range in a round-robin
#				range by connection. The range is specified by
#				<first ip in range>-<last ip in range>.
#
#				Example: 206.124.146.177-206.124.146.180
#
#				Finally, you may also specify a comma-separated
#				list of ranges and/or addresses in this column.
#				
#				This column may not contain DNS Names.
#
#	Example 1:
#
#		  You have a simple masquerading setup where eth0 connects to
#		  a DSL or cable modem and eth1 connects to your local network
#		  with subnet 192.168.0.0/24.
#
#		  Your entry in the file can be either:
#
#			eth0	eth1
#
#		  or
#
#			eth0	192.168.0.0/24
#
#	Example 2:
#
#		  You add a router to your local network to connect subnet
#		  192.168.1.0/24 which you also want to masquerade. You then
#		  add a second entry for eth0 to this file:
#
#			eth0	192.168.1.0/24
#
#       Example 3:
#
#                 You have an IPSEC tunnel through ipsec0 and you want to
#                 masquerade packets coming from 192.168.1.0/24 but only if
#                 these packets are destined for hosts in 10.1.1.0/24:
#
#                       ipsec0:10.1.1.0/24      196.168.1.0/24
#
#	Example 4:
#
#		  You want all outgoing traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 through
#		  eth0 to use source address 206.124.146.176 which is NOT the
#		  primary address of eth0. You want 206.124.146.176 added to
#		  be added to eth0 with name eth0:0.
#
#			eth0:0	192.168.1.0/24	206.124.146.176
