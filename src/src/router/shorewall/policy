# Shorewall 1.4 -- Policy File
#
# /etc/shorewall/policy
#
#	             THE ORDER OF ENTRIES IN THIS FILE IS IMPORTANT
#
#	This file determines what to do with a new connection request if we
#	don't get a match from the /etc/shorewall/rules file or from the
#	/etc/shorewall/common[.def] file. For each source/destination pair, the
#	file is processed in order until a match is found ("all" will match
#	any client or server).
#
# Columns are:
#
#	SOURCE		Source zone. Must be the name of a zone defined
#			in /etc/shorewall/zones, $FW or "all".
#
#	DEST		Destination zone. Must be the name of a zone defined
#			in /etc/shorewall/zones, $FW or "all"
#
#		WARNING: Firewall->Firewall policies are not allowed; if
#			 you have a policy where both SOURCE and DEST are $FW,
#			 Shorewall will not start!
#
#	POLICY		Policy if no match from the rules file is found. Must
#			be "ACCEPT", "DROP", "REJECT", "CONTINUE" or "NONE".
#
#			ACCEPT		- Accept the connection
#			DROP		- Ignore the connection request
#			REJECT		- For TCP, send RST. For all other, send
#					  "port unreachable" ICMP.
#			CONTINUE	- Pass the connection request past
#					  any other rules that it might also
#					  match (where the source or destination
#					  zone in those rules is a superset of
#					  the SOURCE or DEST in this policy).
#			NONE		- Assume that there will never be any
#					  packets from this SOURCE
#					  to this DEST. Shorewall will not set up
#					  any infrastructure to handle such
#				 	  packets and you may not have any rules
#					  with this SOURCE and DEST in the
#					  /etc/shorewall/rules file. If such a
#					  packet _is_ received, the result is
#					  undefined. NONE may not be used if the 
#					  SOURCE or DEST columns contain the
#					  firewall zone ($FW) or "all".
#
#	LOG LEVEL	If supplied, each connection handled under the default
#			POLICY is logged at that level. If not supplied, no
#			log message is generated. See syslog.conf(5) for a
#			description of log levels.
#
#			Beginning with Shorewall version 1.3.12, you may
#			also specify ULOG (must be in upper case). This will
#			log to the ULOG target and sent to a separate log
#			through use of ulogd
#			(http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd).
#
#			If you don't want to log but need to specify the
#			following column, place "_" here.
#
#	LIMIT:BURST	If passed, specifies the maximum TCP connection rate
#			and the size of an acceptable burst. If not specified,
#			TCP connections are not limited.
#
#	As shipped, the default policies are:
#
#	a) All connections from the local network to the internet are allowed
#	b) All connections from the internet are ignored but logged at syslog
#	   level KERNEL.INFO.
#	d) All other connection requests are rejected and logged at level
#	   KERNEL.INFO.
