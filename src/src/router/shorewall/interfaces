# Shorewall 1.4 -- Interfaces File
#
# /etc/shorewall/interfaces
#
#	You must add an entry in this file for each network interface on your
#	firewall system.
#
# Columns are:
#
#	ZONE		Zone for this interface. Must match the short name
#			of a zone defined in /etc/shorewall/zones.
#
#			If the interface serves multiple zones that will be
#			defined in the /etc/shorewall/hosts file, you should
#			place "-" in this column.
#
#	INTERFACE	Name of interface. Each interface may be listed only
#			once in this file. You may NOT specify the name of
#			an alias (e.g., eth0:0) here; see
#			http://www.shorewall.net/FAQ.htm#faq18
#
#			You may specify wildcards here. For example, if you
#			want to make an entry that applies to all PPP
#			interfaces, use 'ppp+'.
#
#			DO NOT DEFINE THE LOOPBACK INTERFACE (lo) IN THIS FILE.
#
#	BROADCAST	The broadcast address for the subnetwork to which the
#			interface belongs. For P-T-P interfaces, this
#			column is left black.If the interface has multiple
#			addresses on multiple subnets then list the broadcast
#			addresses as a comma-separated list.
#
#			If you use the special value "detect", the firewall
#			will detect the broadcast address for you. If you
#			select this option, the interface must be up before
#			the firewall is started, you must have iproute
#			installed and the interface must only be associated
#			with a single subnet.
#
#			If you don't want to give a value for this column but
#			you want to enter a value in the OPTIONS column, enter
#			"-" in this column.
#
#	OPTIONS		A comma-separated list of options including the
#			following:
#
#			dhcp	     - interface is managed by DHCP or used by
#                                      a DHCP server running on the firewall or
#				       you have a static IP but are on a LAN
#				       segment with lots of Laptop DHCP clients.
#			norfc1918    - This interface should not receive
#				       any packets whose source is in one
#				       of the ranges reserved by RFC 1918
#				       (i.e., private or "non-routable"
#				       addresses. If packet mangling is
#				       enabled in shorewall.conf, packets
#				       whose destination addresses are
#				       reserved by RFC 1918 are also rejected.
#			routefilter  - turn on kernel route filtering for this
#				       interface (anti-spoofing measure). This
#                                      option can also be enabled globally in
#				       the /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf file.
#			dropunclean  - Logs and drops mangled/invalid packets
#
#			logunclean   - Logs mangled/invalid packets but does
#				       not drop them.
#	.	.	blacklist    - Check packets arriving on this interface
#				       against the /etc/shorewall/blacklist
#				       file.
#			maclist	     - Connection requests from this interface
#				       are compared against the contents of
#				       /etc/shorewall/maclist. If this option
#				       is specified, the interface must be
#				       an ethernet NIC and must be up before
#				       Shorewall is started.
#			tcpflags     - Packets arriving on this interface are
#				       checked for certain illegal combinations
#				       of TCP flags. Packets found to have
#				       such a combination of flags are handled
#				       according to the setting of
#				       TCP_FLAGS_DISPOSITION after having been
#				       logged according to the setting of
#				       TCP_FLAGS_LOG_LEVEL.
#			proxyarp     -
#				Sets
#				/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<interface>/proxy_arp.
#				Do NOT use this option if you are
#				employing Proxy ARP through entries in
#				/etc/shorewall/proxyarp. This option is
#				intended soley for use with Proxy ARP
#				sub-networking as described at:
#				http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/Proxy-ARP-Subnet
#
#			newnotsyn    - TCP packets that don't have the SYN 
#				       flag set and which are not part of an
#				       established connection will be accepted
#				       from this interface, even if 
#				       NEWNOTSYN=No has been specified in
#				       /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf.
#
#				       This option has no effect if 
#				       NEWNOTSYN=Yes.
#
#			routeback    - If specified, indicates that Shorewall
#				       should include rules that allow filtering
#				       traffic arriving on this interface back
#				       out that same interface.
#
#			arp_filter   - If specified, this interface will only
#				       respond to ARP who-has requests for IP
#				       addresses configured on the interface.
#				       If not specified, the interface can
#				       respond to ARP who-has requests for
#				       IP addresses on any of the firewall's
#                                      interface. The interface must be up
#				       when Shorewall is started.
#
#			The order in which you list the options is not
#			significant but the list should have no embedded white
#			space.
#
#	Example 1:	Suppose you have eth0 connected to a DSL modem and
#			eth1 connected to your local network and that your
#			local subnet is 192.168.1.0/24. The interface gets
#			it's IP address via DHCP from subnet
#			206.191.149.192/27. You have a DMZ with subnet
#			192.168.2.0/24 using eth2.
#
#			Your entries for this setup would look like:
#
#			net	eth0	206.191.149.223	dhcp
#			local	eth1	192.168.1.255
#			dmz	eth2	192.168.2.255
#
#	Example 2:	The same configuration without specifying broadcast
#			addresses is:
#
#			net	eth0	detect		dhcp
#			loc	eth1	detect
#			dmz	eth2	detect
#
#	Example 3:	You have a simple dial-in system with no ethernet
#			connections.
