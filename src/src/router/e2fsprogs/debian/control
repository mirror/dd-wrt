Description: statically-linked version of the ext2 filesystem checker
 This may be of some help to you if your filesystem gets corrupted enough
 to break the shared libraries used by the dynamically linked checker.
 .
 This binary takes much more space than its dynamic counterpart located
 in e2fsprogs, though.
 .
 You may want to install a statically-linked shell as well, to be able
 to run this program if something like your C library gets corrupted.
