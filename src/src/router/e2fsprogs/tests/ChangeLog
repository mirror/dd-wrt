	* f_dup_de, r_resize_inode: change ">& /dev/null" to ">/dev/null 2>&1"
		for compatibility with FreeBSD. In $DEBUGFS commands, move the
		-R arg argument first so that systems with non-GNU getopt()
		can see the request argument (they would otherwise stop
		parsing at the first non-option argument).

2004-12-24  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* f_resize_inode, r_resize_inode: New tests to e2fsck and

		f_special_ea: Update tests to reflect that e2fsck will
		backup the journal inode.

	* f_journal: Change test to include a backed up journal location
		in the superblock, and then corrupt the inode table so the
		journal inode is trashed.  Make sure e2fsck can recover
		from it.

2003-08-01  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* f_salveage_dir: Remove HTREE flag from the test image's
		superblock.  (It is not needed).

	* f_h_reindex: Skip this test of the htree is not enabled

	* f_dup_de: If htree is not enabled, clear the htree flag, and use

2003-03-06  Theodore Tso  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* run_e2fsck, defaults/e_script: Solaris doesn't support "tr -d \r",

		immutable flags.

		portabilty.  AIX's sed doesn't support multiple -e
		specifications, even though it's required by Unix 98.

		option to echo is a BSD'ism which isn't specified by the
		Unix 98 / SUSv3 specification.  (And which of course, AIX
		doesn't implement as a result.)

2002-01-06  Andreas Dilger  <adilger@turbolinux.com>

		testcase for e2fsck with an empty 8MB filesystem.  After
		the test filesystem is appropriately "broken" the new
		target "make testend" will create expect files for it.

2001-12-16  Theodore Tso  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* f_ext_journal: Add new test which checks e2fsck's ability to use
		an external journal.

2001-11-30  Theodore Tso  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* f_bad_inode, f_badsymlinks: Update expect files to reflect
		changes in the problem code texts.

	* f_swapfs: The image file used by f_swapfs had bugs which got
		caught by Andreas' changes to be more strict about
		symlinks.

2001-07-26  Andreas Dilger  <adilger@turbolinux.com>

	* f_symlinks: Add several fast symlink error cases to test.

2001-07-27  Theodore Tso  <tytso@valinux.com>

	* f_filetype: Update expect.1 to match changed problem message
		text and the fact that symlinks shouldn't be immutable.

		size text.

2001-06-22  Theodore Tso  <tytso@valinux.com>

	* run_e2fsck, defaults/e_script: Filter out CR characters from the

	* Release of E2fsprogs 1.21

2001-06-02  Theodore Tso  <tytso@valinux.com>

	* f_badinode: Added a fast symlink with an invalid size to test
		e2fsck's handling of this case.

	* f_dup3: New test case which checks handling of blocks claimed
		multiple times by one inode which weren't handled
		correctly by e2fsck 1.20.

	* d_loaddump: Fix test script to remove bash'isms, and make the
		shell script more robust in cases where the user has
		overridden CFLAGS so that the debugfs binary isn't
		compiled with -g, and is smaller than 128k.  Also specify
		the blocksize to be used explictly to avoid problems with
		people who change the mke2fs default parameters.

2001-05-25  Theodore Tso  <tytso@valinux.com>

	* Release of E2fsprogs 1.20

		spurious messages when builddir==srcdir).

2000-05-08  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@valinux.com>

	* f_hurd: Add test for Hurd-specific features (right now, just
		checks to make sure the filetype feature is cleared)

		after the image is compressed and before running e2fsck.

	* Release of E2fsprogs 1.17

1999-06-25    <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* f_lpffile: New test which checks how e2fsck handles a the case

	* Release of E2fsprogs 1.14

1998-12-15  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

1998-02-20  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@edt.mit.edu>

	* f_badinode: Set the immutable flag on the block and
		character device so that e2fsck notices them as bad
		devices, and offers to fix them.  E2fsck currently
		only checks devices with the immutable flag set, since
		otherwise there might be some false positives --- the
		kernel doesn't always clear the all of i_blocks[n],
		n>=4, due to a race condition.

Sat Oct 25 18:38:56 1997  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>
